The Unexpected Combination
by jinfanfics
Summary
So this is a prequel to " Forbidden", and " Ask and you shall receive", and basically it is the story of how Jin and Yoongi met and hooked up.
Notes
I don't even know how I ended up writing this. No, actually I know, it is because I am YoonJin trash and as I was writing " Ask and you shall receive", this idea already started evolving in my head and then Min-The Jerk-Yoongi had to release his masterpiece of a mixtape and slay me and while I listened to it, I just found myself typing this story and somehow ended up writing over 13,000 words of YoonJin fluff...Well...

          See the end of the work for more notes




The Unexpected Combination

If Jin had to describe his first year at Hogwarts in one word, it would definitely be-peaceful.If Jin was to describe his second year, it would be-chaotic.How in the world did he get from being a shy, pretty boy who spent most of his time in the library, or diligently studying in his room ( since the Gryffindor common room was always filled with students, and he was too awkward to speak to anyone), to being in the crowd of sweaty bodies pressing against him as he was desperately trying to find a way out, was almost incomprehensible to him.He could say that he doesn’t know how that happened, but it would be a lie.He knew exactly how his life took this unexpected turn of events.More precisely, he knew who it was that caused all of this.Jung Hoseok.There wasn’t a person in their year that hasn’t heard of the loud, always bright, now 2nd year Gryffindor student, who was known for having tons of friends and being a social butterfly.Another thing he was known for was his talent of making the wildest parties in the castle.How he managed to do that every time, without getting into trouble with the teachers, was beyond Jin.  As he was elbowing his way through the mass of intoxicated teenagers, he wondered why he had ever agreed to Hoseok’s pleading attempts, begging him to come tonight, promising him a night filled with fun and excitement.So far, all Jin could feel was annoyance and a desperate need to get away from this utter mess.Finally, he managed to reach the Astronomy Tower ( a place that usually brought him a peace of mind), far away from the wild party being held in the Room of Requirement.He took a deep sigh, and thought-alone at last.“ Jin!!! JIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN!!!!!”A high-pitched voice filled the otherwise silent place, and Jin shuddered, recognizing the familiar voice.He turned around and flatly said.“ Hey, Hoseok, what’s up?”“ Why did you leave the party, buddy?!!”Hoseok whined, while approaching him with a small pout on his lips.Oh God, he really wasn’t in the mood for this, his head was still throbbing from the music heard in the distance.“ Look, it’s just not my thing. It’s too loud, and I like peace and quiet. I am sorry.”Jin said apologetically, and really meant it.Hoseok had a regretful look as he said.“ But, this is the first time that you came to my party, ever since we started hanging out, and I just wanted you to have fun. After all, my parties are legendary for bringing people together. Even people from Gryffindor and Slytherin do not glare so much at each other at my parties which is a huge success, considering the rivalry between our houses.”Jin felt a bit guilty, suddenly aware of how his friend just wanted him to have fun.After all Hoseok and he were completely different in terms of their personalities.While Hoseok was extremely good at making friends, and entertaining people, Jin was more on the quiet side and extremely awkward around people he didn’t know, even considering himself a bit on the boring side.However, after Namjoon, his Ravenclaw best friend, introduced him to Hoseok who was also in Gryffindor as well as being Namjoon’s close friend, Jin felt himself changing a bit.He was awkward around Hoseok at first, but the guy was so incredibly cheerful and chill that he relaxed almost immediately and somehow became close friends with the guy.The only thing they disagreed about was the fact that Hoseok always tried to make him come to his parties instead of being locked up in his room, surrounded by dusty, old books, throwing his youth away.Jin tried to argue, but Hoseok was too strong of an opponent and now after half of year of convincing, he finally decided to give in.And that was only, because both Namjoon and Hoseok assured him that they would stick together at the party.The traitors ditched him in the first few seconds of the party, with Namjoon going to some Ravenclaw first-year, Taehyung, was it?, and with Hoseok disappearing god knows where.So Jin was irritated and anxious, and he wasn’t enjoying himself, with a few guys and girls hitting on him, rather forcefully, not taking his “no” as an answer so easily, trying to dance pretty sensually with him.He decided that he has had it enough when a girl from Gryffindor grabbed his crotch, making him choke on his spit, and then she smiled innocently at him, and he decided he has had enough of that shit and dashed towards the exit as fast as he could.“ Listen, I appreciate your worry about me spending my youth by being alone with my books most of the time, but I like that, so you don’t have to bother yourself with me. Besides, I would much rather be in my room, where it is safe, rather than being assaulted by various horny teens.”Jin finished with a scowl on his face.“ You are no fun, really. Well, fine, I won’t force you to go back. I have to go, a certain Hufflepuff first-year cutie caught my eye, so catch ya later!”Hoseok once again sing-songed in his too high of a voice.As his friend was leaving, Jin yelled at him.“ Hey, don’t scare some 14-year old kid with your perverted ways!”“ If we are 16 now, that means that he must be 15, so it’s perfectly okay for me to seduce him!”Hoseok yelled back and stuck his tongue out, before disappearing from his sight.Jin lowered his head and sighed in exhaustion.“ You have one pretty fucking loud friend.”an irritated voice startled him and he turned around, surprised when he saw a boy with messy blonde hair, slowly sitting up straight on the bench he was previously lying on, rubbing his eyes, before yawning and shooting Jin a bored look.“ I…Uh, um, yeah…S-sorry…”Jin stuttered out, feeling flustered, because the guy had probably heard their conversation and now thought how boring Jin was.He bit his lip worryingly when the guy kept quiet and he looked up slowly, only to feel himself slightly bushing when he saw the guy still staring at him, now with an unreadable expression, as if he was trying to figure him out.Jin was never really good with leaving first impressions, and he felt anxious and the air was becoming too stuffy for him, so he stuttered once again.“ I, uh, so I will let you go back to sleep, so uh, b-bye.”He said and waved awkwardly, before turning around, ready to walk away when the guy’s low voice made him stop in his tracks.“ You can stay. Just don’t disturb me.”He turned around and saw that the guy was once again lying on the bench, covering his eyes with his hand and Jin was unsure of what to do.He really wasn’t in the mood to go back to the party and the music was so loud that it was heard even in the Gryffindor’s common room.At least here it was peaceful.But then again this grumpy-looking guy made him uneasy, but he seemed to have fallen asleep, so Jin relaxed a bit and went to the opposite side of the guy.He sat on the floor, his back against the wall, and he closed his eyes, enjoying the light breeze tickling his face.He hadn’t even realized how tired he was until he sat on the floor, the tension slowly dissipating from his body as he relaxed his muscles. He opened his eyes when he felt something burning his skin.Even though it was mid-March, the sun was warm on his skin, and only then did he realize that he fell asleep and spent the night here.Shit.His eyes immediately flew to the bench and the blonde-haired guy wasn’t there anymore.He could have at least woken me up, Jin scoffed, but then he realized that despite sleeping in the open, he wasn’t cold.Actually he felt quite warm.He noticed a large black hoodie draped over his body, and he furrowed his eyebrows in confusion.The hoodie smelled of cologne and pineapple.It was a soothing smell.But, who would…?Then his eyes widened in shock, remembering that the grumpy guy from yesterday wore a hoodie.No way, did he do this, because he didn’t want me to freeze?Jin’s cheeks started heating up and he was sure that this time it wasn’t, because of the sunlight falling on them.  The next few days he kept craning his neck in the hallways, trying to spot a certain blonde-haired grump, but without luck.He sighed in frustration.How was he going to return the hoodie if he had no idea who to return it to?He was about to give up on finding the guy, when he spotted a familiar bored look on a blonde-guy’s face who was currently going down the hallway alone.Jin was so excited that he managed to find the guy that he practically rushed towards him and stopped right in front of him, yelling triumphantly.“ Finally, found you!”Then a really weird thing happened.When he said that, he heard people gasping around him and he looked around, seeing how various students from the 4 houses were staring at him in disbelief, shock, and fear?What?He noticed it then that they were staring at the guy in front of him, as if waiting for his next move.Jin finally locked gazes with the grumpy guy who was staring at him so intensely that Jin started to feel really self-conscious, and also confused, because the guy seemed to have that unreadable expression again, but Jin could have sworn that he saw a spark of amusement in his dark brown orbs just for a brief moment, before the guy put on his mask of indifference once again.“ And, why exactly were you looking for me?”The guy spoke in that deep voice which made Jin feel weird for some reason.“ I , uh, well, to return your…Hoodie…”Jin stuttered put once again, and oh great now this guy is going to think that he is some sort of a retard, for not even being able to string a coherent sentence.The guy stared at him for a few seconds, his face not giving away any emotions, before he said in that flat voice.“ Just leave it in the Slytherin common room today, the password is: pure-blood.”Before he started walking away.Jin shivered, his eyes widening, as he repeated in a voice louder than necessary, earning him a few questioning glares who were still staring at the two of them.“ Slytherin?!”The guy turned around and raised an eyebrow at him lazily, his voice sounding a bit threatening.“ Yeah, you got a problem with that?”Yes, Jin thought, but instead shook his head, afraid of angering the boy, who looked as if he could murder him with his stare alone.“ Good.”The guy replied flatly and walked away.He is from Slytherin?And he is asking me to go into their common room to bring him his hoodie?Is he crazy???He remembered the password: pure-blood, and scoffed at the irony of it, since he was nowhere near being that.This was all because of Hoseok and his stupid party.If he had just stayed in his room, none of this would have happened.He wouldn’t have disturbed the Slytherin boy’s precious sleep.He wouldn’t have fallen asleep in the Astronomy Tower.He wouldn’t have woken up covered with his hoodie.And he wouldn’t have to go into his own doom by going into the common room of his house’s biggest rival.If he survives this afternoon, he was sure that he was going to go and kick Hoseok’s ass after that. When it was 4 p.m. Jin took a deep breath, before taking the neatly folded hoodie, and making his way towards his sure end.He had spent the last 2 hours, worrying his head off about what could happen to him, and he considered not going today, and returning the hoodie some other day, but the prospect of a blonde-haired grump coming to haunt him down and murder him in his sleep won over his fear of going into the Slytherin’s common room.He tried to still his heart which was threatening to jump out of his chest from fear as he made shaky steps down the staircase towards the Slytherin Dungeon.Come on Jin, you are from Gryffindor, you should be brave, so stop being such a chicken, suck it up, leave the hoodie and run for your life.He took a deep breath, standing in front of the stone wall, before whispering the password.Suddenly a passage was revealed to him, and he moved forward, his heartbeat increasing with each step he made.He found himself in dungeon-like room, which seemed rather cold when compared to the common room in Gryffindor. There were greenish lamps, chairs and black leather sofas as well as a fireplace in the end of the room. There were lots of skulls around the room and on tables, and Jin felt uneasy. He really didn’t like this place.Luckily, there was no one here, with most classes still ongoing, so he took quick steps towards the nearest table, ready to place the hoodie there and get away from there as fast as possible.“ Huh? It seems that we have an intruder here.”He heard a sinister voice behind him and he was sure he was going to have a heart-attack from how fast his heart was racing in his chest.He turned around slowly, trying to look as calm as possible, at least on the outside, because on the inside he was freaking out.He was met with two tall figures, well they were slightly taller than him, both boys having dark black hair, their eyes glimmering with something evil while their lips curled into a smirk.He felt his breath hitch when one guy said.“ Oh, well look at this, not only do we have an intruder, but also he is from Gryffindor.”Shit.He needed to get away from here, but his legs seemed as if they were glued to the spot.“ Yeah, would you look at that. Too bad he is from Gryffindor, he is so pretty that it makes me almost regret what we have to do to him.”The other guy said, checking him out from head to toe until his eyes darkened and Jin shivered involuntarily, causing the two guys to let out an amused chuckle.“Too bad, cutie…”the guy continued, raising his fingers towards Jin, and he couldn’t breathe, or move, too paralyzed by fear and he closed his eyes until he heard someone behind him say in a calm, but angry voice.“Confringo.”Making the chair next to the guy’s side explode in flames, causing him to jump away as well as his friend.“ What the fuck?!”The guy screamed and Jin stared at the chair that was now practically turned into ash, in shock.He felt the familiar smell of cologne and pineapple next to him, and he noticed the blonde standing next to him with a raised wand, staring at the two Slytherin boys with such an omnious glare that Jin was surprised how the two guys didn’t drop dead at the spot.“ Min Yoongi, what is the meaning of this?!”The guy that called Jin pretty growled and made Jin flinch a bit.He was surprised when he felt a light squeeze on his wrist and he looked down, staring at long, slender fingers gently wrapped around his wrist, and then he looked at the blonde whose eyes never left those guys.He felt weird once again, but not because of fear.It was something different, but he couldn’t figure out what.      “ What is the meaning of you attacking my visitor?”The blonde asked coldly and Jin felt his heart skipping a beat.
My visitor…
He didn’t know why, but those words had made him feel a bit strange.Somehow, fuzzy inside?However, he had no time to think about it when the black-haired boy practically spat out his words.“ Your visitor?!!! Who the hell do you think you are to be bringing somebody here, and on top of that a Gryffindor TRASH!”Jin winced slightly at those words, but he felt that light squeeze on his hand once more and he relaxed a bit, that is until the guy continued yelling.“You are very well aware of the warning imposed on all of us and that is to never bring the people from other houses here, let alone give them the password!”Jin was not aware of that rule and he widened his eyes in shock at the blonde who seemed completely undisturbed by the whole situation as he answered cooly.“ That rule is bullshit, and if any of the teachers has a problem with me not following it then they can speak to me about it, instead of having their kiss-ass servants molesting other students. Now, get lost, or else I will get really mad. And I doubt you would want to experience my wrath.”The blonde finished sending them a death-glare and they cursed him and Jin, before leaving them alone.It was only when they were out of sight that the guy turned to him, his expression now indifferent as he asked.“ Are you okay?”Jin stared at him, dumbfounded, before he said.“ Y-yes.”Only it came out as some choked up sound instead of a normal answer and Min Yoongi clicked his tongue and pulled him by his wrist while saying.“ Come on.”Jin let himself be pulled by the quiet blonde all the way to the paved grounds, earning them a few puzzled looks and whispers between students who saw them.Well, it probably was weird to see someone from Slytherin and Gryffindor going together and not trying to kill each other.When they were finally in one of the passageways, alone, Min Yoongi let go off his arm and Jin found himself feeling a bit disappointed at the lack of warmth which was there a few minutes ago.“ I can’t believe I was so reckless about all of this.”The blonde said, letting out a frustrated sigh and Jin lowered his head, thinking how he must feel regret that he went against 2 of his own housemates just to defend some Gryffindor guy.“ Seriously, I should have known better. I tried to wait for you, so that no one would do something like this to you, but god damn it, I fell asleep on that wretched, comfortable sofa.”The blonde continued, kicking the pebble in front of his feet and groaning.Jin looked up, surprised.He was waiting for him, so that he wouldn’t get hurt?His heart was again doing some weird stuff, hammering against his chest.“ But, you are from Gryffindor? Fuck, why didn’t you tell me earlier? If I knew that, then I would have never told you to come in our common room, and risk your safety.”The blonde stated in a casual voice and Jin parted his lips in disbelief.“ What?”Min Yoongi asked with a scowl on his face, noticing Jin staring at him with disbelief.“ I, uh, nothing… It’s just that, you didn’t really give me a chance to tell you…”Jin replied quietly, trying to disregard the fact that this guy was worried about his safety and trying to stop his heart from thumping so loudly.“ Hm, I guess you have a point. Oh well, at least nothing bad happened. Can you go back to your dorm?”Yoongi asked, staring at him, making Jin feel weird once again and he scratched his neck awkwardly and replied.“ Yeah, I, uh, yeah, thanks Min Yoongi.”The blonde chuckled slightly and Jin’s heart wouldn’t stop hitting his chest after hearing that sound and he saw Yoongi’s stare which seemed softer this time.“ No problem, uh, your name is?”“ S-seokjin, but, everyone calls me Jin.”Jin replied quickly, in one breath, causing the corners of Yoongi’s lips to curl upward slightly, which was bad for Jin’s weak heart especially when Yoongi started walking away, before turning around to him and saying.“ Thanks for washing my hoodie, Jin, I was too lazy to do it anyways. Oh, and you may call me Yoongi.”Before he broke into the most adorable gummy smile Jin had seen in his life, his heart definitely threatening to stop pumping blood to his body, as he watched the boy retreating, lifting his hand in the air as some sort of a wave towards Jin.Jin stood there for a few more moments.This was bad.He isn’t supposed to react like this to someone from a Slytherin, especially not at some guy with a murderous aura who was obviously feared by many.But then, he remembered that gummy smile and his heart skipped a bit, making him groan in frustration.It was all Hoseok’s fault.He dragged his feet to his dorm, determined to kill his friend, for disrupting his boring, uneventful life.   After that incident in the Slytherin’s common room, Jin became slightly obsessed with a certain blonde that made him feel all weird and tingly on the inside.He admits that he was at first curious about what kind of a person his unexpected savior was, but then he started absorbing all the facts about him like a sponge, always wanting to know more.He knew that if he had asked Hoseok, he would probably get to know even the smallest details about Min Yoongi, like what brand of underwear he wore, but he really wasn’t in the mood for Hoseok questioning his intention about wanting to know more of the Slytherin grump.So, he turned to Namjoon.Surprisingly, Namjoon had heard more about the guy than Jin would have guessed.For someone, who spent most of the time in his own little world, surrounded by philosophical thoughts about the meaning of life, Namjoon sure knew a lot about Yoongi.Apparently, Yoongi was a 2nd year student just like them, but he missed most of the classes, because he liked to sleep.That is why Jin never saw him before in any of their classes.It seems that it was a wide-known fact that Min Yoongi liked to sleep more than anything else and everybody who was sane enough knew not to wake him, or else… Namjoon never finished what else, just leaving the words hanging in air as if they were in some sort of a horror movie.Jin sighed, but didn’t question Namjoon, interested in finding out more about the mysterious blonde.It seems that he always had that bitch-face sort of expression, never bothering to make friends, and always glaring at people who seemed to be afraid of him, because of that.Jin did see his glare, but now he wondered if the boy had really been glaring most of the time, or if he was just sleepy.What surprised Jin the most was the fact that Yoongi was in some sort of a band.Namjoon knew that because he was interested in hip-hop and went to some underground rap battle in some pub in the tunnels underneath Hogsmeade and was surprised to see Yoongi there, rapping his heart out, captivating the audience with his rhymes and the sick beat that followed.It seems that he was a rapper as well as a singer in some band, which made Jin imagine Yoongi in some leather jacket, sweat dripping down his forehead, his blonde hair messy and, nope…stop it Jin, you perv, he told himself, as he felt his heats heating up just at the thought.“Also, people say that he never smiles.”“ That’s a lie.”Jin blurted out as a response to Namjoon’s statement, earning him a puzzled look from his best friend.“ I mean, there is just no way that he never smiles, right? Haha.”Jin tried to cover up for his slip-up, clearly remembering the gummy smile on that pale-faced strangely attractive grump.“ I guess. But, that’s just what people say.”Namjoon answered, not noticing his friend’s reddening cheeks, too absorbed in some book to Jin’s immense relief. It’s been 3 days since Jin’s near-death experience in the Slytherin common room.Okay, maybe he was exaggerating a bit, but still.That meant that 3 days have passed since he had seen the object of his curiosity.Every time he went to his classes he would scan the classroom, searching for a familiar mop of blonde hair and a set of narrow, dark brown, uninterested eyes, and every time he would get disappointed after not finding what he was looking for.He was packing his stuff in his bag after his class, thinking about the assignment he had to do. He was supposed to do a research on werewolves for his Defence Against the Dark Arts class, but he needed a partner.They were supposed to do it in pairs, but Hoseok and Namjoon weren’t in this group, so he was left without a partner.Everyone had already paired with each other and the teacher told him that he should try and ask someone from the other groups if they need a partner.How was he supposed to do that, he wondered, feeling his social anxiety kicking in.“ You missed yet another class.”He heard his teacher say to someone who had just come into the classroom, but Jin was too busy packing, wanting to get away from the classroom as fast as he could so as to avoid some unpleasant scene.“ Yeah, sorry, I overslept.”This statement and that voice made him look up and surely there was only one person who could say that in such a disinterested voice.“ Min Yoongi, I am going to have to have you retake the class next year. I could give you another chance, but you don’t even have a partner for the presentation that is 40% of your grade for next week, and…”“ I WILL DO IT!”Jin regretted interrupting his teacher, especially when he and Yoongi turned to him, both of them widening their eyes slightly, until Jin lowered his hand that was up in the air and cleared his throat, before saying in a lower voice.“ I mean, I also don’t have a partner, so me and Yoongi can do this project together.”The teacher sighed and murmured “okay, but this is your last chance Mr. Min, don’t screw it up” and with a wave of his hand he dismissed them.When they were outside the classroom, Yoongi turned to him with a questioning look and said.“ Why did you do that?”“ Huh?”Jin asked confused.“ Why are you ruining your reputation by volunteering to work with me?”Yoongi pressed on and Jin was a bit taken aback by the question, because he never thought of it as ruining his reputation?“ Unless, you plan to ditch this project and let me do all the work, then I see no problem in volunteering to work with you.”Jin answered confidently.“ And what if I am planning on doing that?”Yoongi asked in a low voice, his eyes unreadable as he took a step closer to Jin.“ W-what do you mean?”Jin asked alarmed, backing away a bit out of instinct, but Yoongi kept closing the distance between them slowly.“ What I mean is, what if I am planning on ditching the project? Then what, will you rat me out to the teacher?”His voice got even deeper as he was now standing in front of Jin whose back was now against the wall and he felt trapped by Yoongi’s hands on both sides of the wall.“ Well, I, uh, I don’t think you are like that…A-and if you are then I misjudged you, but I would still not rat you out…After all I owe you for saving me the other day…”Jin finished, his voice a bit shaky, but sure, because he really meant what he said.Yoongi was staring at him, not saying anything and Jin once again felt as if he was being studied, as if Yoongi was trying to see whether he was lying, or not and then he smiled, and not in that way when he showed his gums, no this was more of a small smile, like a smirk, as if he was satisfied with the answer.He pushed himself from the wall, saying in a louder voice.“ Good to know! Now, come on, we need to start working on this project, so that I wouldn’t have to bother with it next year.”And with that he started walking towards the library with Jin blinking after him in confusion.“ Jin, are you coming?”Yoongi stopped walking and turned around to him when he realized that Jin was still not moving from his spot and Jin started blushing, before coming back to his senses and rushing forward, stuttering.“ Y-yeah, I am coming!”Even though Jin had expected Yoongi to fall asleep in the library, the blonde proved him wrong, and actually Jin realized that the guy was kind of a genius.Well, not the same kind of genius like Namjoon with his IQ of 148, and his photographic memory ( while the rest of the mortals, Jin included, had to go through a painful process of going over one sentence at least 5 times in order to memorize it), but Yoongi was kind of a practical guy.He picked on stuff fast and he even started building some model of a loft, using his hands and some wood that had fallen off the shelves while Jin just stared at his work in awe.Even with his high grades, he felt like he was the useless one.“ So, what do you think?”Yoongi asked after he had finished his model and Jin just said in a sort of a daze.“ It’s amazing. How is it possible that you are failing this subject?”He asked genuinely surprised, and Yoongi chuckled, making Jin’s heart unsteady again.“ Well, I write music and my inspiration comes at inconvenient times at about 2, or 3 a.m., so I usually oversleep most of my classes.”He answered in a sort of a “what can you do” tone, and Jin pouted and said.“ It’s not fair that you have to sacrifice your grades, or your passion. They should just let people make flexible schedules so that students don’t have to choose between studying and what they love to do. Sheesh, isn’t this a wizarding school after all.”His face started heating up when he saw Yoongi staring at him with some sort of a strange look that he couldn’t decipher while his mouth was parted in a tiny “O”.“W-what?”Jin asked, feeling a bit uneasy.“ Nothing, it’s just that you would make a great lawyer.”Yoongi said thoughtfully and gave him a sincere smile, his eyes sparkling and Jin’s ears went pink and he ducked his head in embarrassment and bashfully said.“ Thanks.”He was sure that he had imagined it when a few seconds later he thought he had heard Yoongi whisper under his breath.“ cute.”When he looked up, Yoongi was checking his model of the loft and Jin knew that he had imagined it.Like he could ever be cute, or like someone as cool as Yoongi would ever see somebody like him who was an awkward dork, in that light.After they had finished most of the stuff for their research, he was about to head to his room and take a nap after a long day of studying when Yoongi suddenly asked.“ Hey, do you maybe, I don’t know, want to go grab coffee somewhere?”Jin widened his eyes in surprise and stared at Yoongi who was looking away and scratching his head, and he probably wanted to talk more about the research, and Jin was tired, but if that meant spending more time with the blonde than he was totally up for it, so he said.“ Sure.”and when Yoongi smiled slightly at him, Jin knew that it was worth missing his sleep for some more time with the charming blonde.They went to a little, cozy pub in Hogsmeade, settling in the corner of the pub, near the window, with coffees in their hands.There was a slightly awkward silence in the beginning and just as Yoongi opened his mouth to say something, Jin beat him to it, blurting out.“ How did you end up in Slytherin?”Judging by Yoongi’s surprised stare, it was a weird question, and of course it was, shit, I mean wow Jin, clap, clap, that’s right insult the guy’s house, what a great conversation-starter.“ Well, actually, I am not sure myself. I think it was because I was sassy towards the Sorting Hat.”Yoongi answered with an amused chuckle and Jin looked at him, once again surprised by the unexpected answer from Yoongi who didn’t seem to mind his question.“ Come again?”Jin said. He never heard of anyone sassing the Sorting Hat, but then again he had never met anyone like this guy.“ Okay, so the thing was that I never really cared where I would end up. All the houses seemed the same to me, and I didn’t even want to go to Hogwarts. But, my parents forced me, saying how I will have fun and meet lots of people there and become more powerful and blah, blah, blah. The thing was that I didn’t give a shit about that. I just wanted to compose music. Anyways, they dragged me here, and what could I do, I accepted my cruel fate. On the day of the sorting I was very sleepy and that old geezer was thinking for too long where to put me and my eyes were already closing on their own. He kept saying how I am lazy, but also ambitious about music, but I am not cunning, and I am smart, but unmotivated and blah, blah, and all that jibberish about never having encountered someone as difficult as me to sort into a house, so I snapped and told him to just hurry the fuck up and place me somewhere so that I can go to sleep already. I think I offended him, because the next thing I knew he said that my rude mouth belongs to Slytherin and yeah that’s how I ended up there. My parents were ecstatic since they are both from Slytherin, but honestly, I couldn’t care less. I just needed a bed at that moment.”When Yoongi finished his story, Jin stared at him for a few moments, before he burst out laughing.“ Oh my God, are you for real?! AHhhHAHAHAHAHA, how can there be someone like you?! Seriously, this is gold!”Jin yelled out while clutching his tummy and when he calmed down a bit he noticed Yoongi’s hand now resting on his elbows as he stared at Jin with a small smile on his lips.Jin felt a bit self-conscious once again, remembering how much he did not like his own smile and always covered his mouth with his hand when he laughed, and he probably looked really ugly right now when he laughed sincerely.“ You should laugh like that more often. It suits you.”Yoongi’s voice snapped him out of his thoughts and he felt himself melting at the warm look Yoongi was giving him and his ears were burning again as he ducked his head and scratched his neck awkwardly, saying shyly.“ Uhm, thanks, I like… Your gummy smile, too.”When he glanced up, it was his time to stare at Yoongi whose cheeks were now dusted with a soft pink colour as he looked away and ruffled his own hair, saying a bit awkwardly.“ Erm, ah, yeah, sure… So, uh, we should probably get back to the castle, it’s getting dark.”Jin nodded, still stunned at what he had witnessed.Did he really see Min Yoongi blushing??!!!No way, he thought and later that night he giggled to himself while reading a book in the common room, remembering Yoongi’s shyness.He was in such a good mood, well that was until Hoseok saw him giggling and remarked ( loud enough for everyone who was in common room to hear it).“ Wow, Jin, you finally lost it, to even giggle while holding a book. Books are not alive, well okay some are, but this one that you are holding is not. She can’t hear you. She did not make a joke. It’s all in your head.”Needless to say, Jin blushed from embarrassment, but that did not stop him from throwing his book at Hoseok, hitting him in the head, making him whine and making everyone laugh at him while Jin strutted to his room, and slammed the door shut.Ah, once again he was in good mood, remembering Hoseok’s cry of pain.It’s the little things that make life better. He and Yoongi continued working on their project, having met about 4 more times, discussing the details about their work, but almost always going to have a cup of coffee, or butterbeer in Hogsmeade, usually chatting about silly things, like what they want to do when they graduate, or what their favourite food was, and stuff like that.After they had done a good job in their class, and Yoongi managed to not have to retake the class, Jin was happy, but also sad, because he was sure that their interactions stop there.However, once again Yoongi had proved him wrong, asking him to hang out a few days later in Hogsmeade.After that they met up frequently, and texted each other about how their day was, or about Yoongi’s music and Jin’s hunger issues.He was always hungry and Yoongi always teased him and called him a “black hole”, but Yoongi also always ended up giving him most of his food since Yoongi didn’t have much of an appetite and Jin, well he was ready to devour everything.Jin liked to consider them friends, even though his heart was telling him that he definitely looked at Yoongi in a “ more than just friends” kind of way, but he tried to push those thoughts to the back of his mind.He knew that Yoongi wasn’t interested in him in that way.Sure, Yoongi would smile around him, and he would even laugh at Jin’s bad puns, since he was also into bad puns and then they would break out into loud laughter, Jin not bothering to cover his mouth when he smiled, and Yoongi flashing that gummy smile, despite people staring at them strangely.And yes, they didn’t even mind being seen in the castle together, and they knew that there were weird rumours about them, some of the people even going as far as saying that Jin blackmailed Yoongi into hanging out with him, but Yoongi would always glare at those students spreading such rumours and grab Jin’s hand taking him away from the evil voices.Even though Jin was bothered by those rumours, in those moments his mind was solely focused on the way his and Yoongi’s hand perfectly fit each other, the way their body temperature mixed until it was soothing for both of them, the way Yoongi would squeeze his wrist, or hand lightly whenever Jin was upset about something, in that way offering him silent comfort.And all those things made Jin fall for Yoongi even more, but he knew that it was a one-sided feeling.After getting to know Yoongi, and realizing that he was not as cold as everyone thought and that he was in fact the kind of person that didn’t open up to others easily, but to ones that he did, he did it whole-heartedly, offering them protection and his loyalty.Jin saw that in the way Yoongi treated his band members-Chanyeol, the tall red-haired giant with a goofy-smile, and Kihyun, the brown-haired cutie who was also a prankster.Now, Jin was sure that he was no more special to Yoongi than they were.He was just a friend, and neither Jin, nor Yoongi cared much about the rivalry between their houses, and when Yoongi invited him to one of his gigs in Hogsmeade, he knew that Yoongi saw him as someone he could trust, someone he cared for, as a friend of course.Hoseok and Namjoon disagreed with him since they tagged alone ( annoying idiots), saying how Yoongi only smiled when he was with him, although Jin knew that it wasn’t true.Yoongi also smiled around Chanyeol and Kihyun.They also said that Yoongi always seemed protective of him in the hallway when someone badmouthed Jin, but Jin knew that Yoongi was just like that, a loyal, protective friend.He dismissed their theories about Yoongi liking him, and just settled on enjoying the way Yoongi rapped.This time he wasn’t with his friends, but he had a solo rap performance and Jin was nervous and excited for him.The whole setting looked the same as it did in the muggle world since Jin went to a couple of nightclubs and performances with his friends in the muggle world.There was a stage and the crowd was gathered in front of it, but the difference was that here people did not push each other, creating extra space with magic around them, so that everyone could breathe normally, and enjoy the performance without being squeezed by sweaty bodies.Also, another difference was that in this particular place, magic was allowed ( as long as it was not harmful), so there were drinks floating in the air, fairy dust swirling in various shapes above their heads, creating a beautiful scene with little pink glittery stars, golden moons and red hearts floating across the pub, making it look even more magical.Finally, Yoongi got on stage.Well, actually, Agust D, came on stage.It was his stage name and Jin once asked him what was the meaning behind that name, but he ended up staring at Yoongi’s lips and the way he moved his fingers, and hands as he was gesturing and explaining the meaning, so he might have not heard anything Yoongi had said that time.Only when Yoongi stopped talking did Jin realize that he was supposed to say something so he said.“ Wow.”and that seemed to please Yoongi who did not see through Jin’s lie, because he shrugged his shoulders and had bragged saying.“ I know, I am a genius.”Jin was really curious behind the meaning of the name, but he was too embarrassed to say that he was too distracted by his face and hands, so he kept quiet.Rapper Yoongi was much different than Yoongi in a band.When Yoongi was singing, he seemed soulful and sexy in that sort of “rocker” kind of way.But, Yoongi as Agust D was…Woah…He was badass, and fierce, and angry and just overall breathtaking.The emotions that he conveyed were so raw and Jin was sure that he stopped breathing the moment Yoongi started rapping, and started breathing only when Yoongi had finished.He rapped 2 songs, both written by him, one was “ Agust D” just like his name and the second one was “ The Last”.When he was rapping to “ The Last”, Jin was blown away by the intensity of his performance and he could feel the passion oozing out of Yoongi with every line he delivered.When he finished, the crowd went wild, cheering for him, praising him, asking for more, and Jin found himself wanting for more too.But, not more of Agust D, or rocker Yoongi, no…He was selfish.He wanted more of the real Yoongi, the one that was hiding behind all of those masks, the one that he showed only to his friends and family, and Jin.Jin craved to learn more about him, to get Yoongi to open up more to him and to get Yoongi to be his.However, he knew that it was impossible.How in the world was he, a simple shy guy from Gryffindor supposed to do that when Yoongi was so out of this world?Sure, Jin knew that his looks were out of this world as well, because no matter how shy he was, he was constantly asked out by various guys and girls, based on his appearance only.Heck, even he was sometimes in love with himself, when he would see his reflection in the mirror he had to stop sometimes and flirt with himself in the mirror.But, the thing was that he didn’t want to be with someone who wanted him for his looks only.And that was another thing he liked about Yoongi.The guy didn’t seem to care about someone’s appearance either, because Jin knew that no matter how feared he was, many gorgeous people tried to hit on Yoongi as well, only to be rejected every time.Jin was always relieved when he saw Yoongi rejecting them, but what did it matter anyways?It’s not like he rejected them, because of him.He rejected them because he said they were annoying and wanted to be with him only because of his fame.Jin wanted to add “ and because of your attractive looks and charisma”, but he refrained himself from doing so.Even now, as Yoongi was walking towards him and Namjoon and Hoseok, the guys and girls flocked around him, clinging to him, but he paid no attention to them.“ Hey, glad you came.”Yoongi finally said when he joined them at the bar and Jin smiled and said sincerely.“ Yeah, me too… This was… Amazing. I am speechless.”Yoongi flashed him that gummy smile once again and Jin had to take a sip of his drink quickly so that he would cool the heat creeping up his cheeks.“ Hey!!! I am Hoseok! And you were on FIREEEE!”His friend screamed cheerfully and Jin cringed, knowing how much Yoongi hated when someone was loud.However, he was surprised when Yoongi actually smiled at Hoseok and said.“ Thanks, so you are Jin’s loud friend. The wild party organizer, Jung Hoseok.”“ That’s me! Now if you will excuse me I have to go and mingle. I saw many cuties here, so see ya later!”Hoseok screamed with joy and practically threw himself into the crowd.Seriously, that guy…“ Hey man, I am Namjoon. Your rap was really dope.”Namjoon said and he and Yoongi shook hands.Afterwards, they somehow ended up talking about hip-hop and stuff and although Jin was glad that they were getting along, he was sulking a bit, because he didn’t get to spend any alone-time with Yoongi.After about an hour with Hoseok still somewhere in the crowd, preying on those poor, unsuspecting souls, and with Namjoon now talking to Kihyun who came to support Yoongi, and with Yoongi nowhere in sight, Jin decided he should call it a night.He bid Namjoon and Kihyun goodbye and went out of the pub.When he was outside, he closed his eyes and inhaled the fresh air.It was already dark and there were barely any people around, but he felt at ease, enjoying the silence.“ So, you would leave without even saying goodbye?”a familiar deep voice behind him said.When he turned around he saw Yoongi with his arms crossed on his chest, staring at him and was he angry?“ Well, I didn’t see you anywhere, and I really couldn’t stand the noise anymore, so…”Jin answered.“ Well, I got caught up by your friend Hoseok who brought some wide-eyed Hufflepuff boy Jimin to meet me, saying how Jimin was my fan and what-not, and the boy looked at me as if I was some saint, so I felt bad for the guy and talked to him a bit, although I am pretty sure your friend just wants to get into his pants.”God damn it Hoseok, can’t you keep it in your pants for one night, Jin thought irritated.“ S-sorry about that.”Jin answered embarrassed.Yoongi let out a sigh and said.“ It’s fine, I actually find your friends tolerable. Well, Hoseok is too loud for my taste, but he seems like a fun guy when he is not being  total pervert. And Namjoon may be too philosophical, seriously he bored me to death with his story about how on his trip to Finland one year, he saw some clouds in the shape of a queen and what-not, and I seriously had no idea someone can talk about clouds for solid 20 minutes without a pause, but hey, you learn something new every day. But, other than that he is pretty smart and cool. The only thing I regret is that we couldn’t spend some time together.”Jin couldn’t believe that Yoongi also wanted to spend time with him.He tried to tell himself that he meant it just in a friends kind of way, but his heart disobeyed him and kept racing inside of his chest.“ Y-yeah, I also regret that…”Jin said quietly, staring at his feet.“ Okay, so then how about we change that?”Yoongi stated in his deep voice and Jin looked up, only to be an inch away from Yoongi who closed the distance between them.He widened his eyes slightly, staring at Yoongi who was just staring back at him, expression unreadable as always, and Jin really hated that he was like an open book most of the times while Yoongi was the complete opposite, so he tried to keep his voice as calm as possible when he asked.“ What do you mean?”And of course, taking his feelings towards Yoongi into consideration, this would be the perfect chance for Yoongi to make his move and just kiss him already, but Yoongi wasn’t into him, so of course that devilish grin was tugging on the corner of his lips as he took Jin by the wrist and said.“ So, let’s go to the castle together and make-up for the lost time. Besides, you haven’t praised my performance enough, and I am in the mood to be complimented.”Jin rolled his eyes and replied.“ When are you not?”and when Yoongi stuck his tongue out at him and his mouth split into a wide grin, Jin wished that he was less of a coward and that he would just confess to Yoongi right then and there, but instead he let Yoongi pull him by the wrist like always and started expressing his admiration at Yoongi’s performance, making the blonde wear a pleased smile.Jin wondered how long he was going to be able to go on like this, hiding his true feelings which gradually increased, with every spent moment with Yoongi.He didn’t want to stop spending time with the Slyhterin boy, because, first of all they were friends, and Yoongi was really similar to him in many aspects, because he also liked peace and quiet and understood Jin. Second of all, it would be just wrong to suddenly start avoiding Yoongi, causing the guy to think he did something wrong, or something like that. Finally, even though it was hard being around Yoongi, and not being able to touch him the way he wanted to, or hug him, or even kiss him, it would have been much harder not to be around him.Jin just feared the day when Yoongi would fall for someone and then Jin would have to watch them all the time, being in love and everything, and he wasn’t sure if he could handle that. It was almost the end of April, and they were supposed to go to that two days, one-night trip to the castle where Dracula lived. It wasn’t the one in Romania, in the muggle world, but this one was the castle in the magical world where Dracula still lives. Jin wasn’t too excited about this trip, because he wasn’t very fond of vampires, especially since he was a half-blood, and it was known that vampires preferred human blood more than the one of pure-bloods. However, they were assured that Count Dracula and his army of blood-sucking leeches ( as Jin called them) won’t do anything to them during their visit, and besides they would be staying in some hotel far, far away from the castle so he relaxed a bit.Unfortunately, there was no room for him in the compartment cart where Namjoon and Hoseok were, well they tried to get him to be with them, but the Head Boy of Gryffindor told him that only two people per cart are allowed, so his friends threw them a sympathetic look as he went to find an empty cart.Most of them were already occupied, and he was already starting to lose hope of finding a place for himself, when he spotted an empty cart and immediately went in, placing his bag in the compartment above his head.He wondered who would be his travelling buddy, and he tried to think of some topics for them to get to know each other better, when he spotted 3 familiar figures passing by his cart and laughing.The first one out of the three looked at him and immediately stopped, making his two friends bump into him with loud groans.Jin let out a small giggle, causing the two guys to look at him as well.When they recognized him, the one in the middle opened the door to his cart, wearing his usual goofy smile.“ Oh, hey Jin, are you alone?”“ Yeah, my friends are in another cart, and only 2 people per cart are allowed, so I got ditched, hahaha.”Jin said with a smile.“ Well, then I volunteer to keep you company! Besides, I am sick of seeing these guys faces every day.”The tall red-haired boy said and was just about to step into his cart when the blonde who was in front of him made a grumpy face and pulled him away.“ If anyone is sick of you guys, it’s me! You are too loud, so I will sit with Jin who is quiet and you Chanyeol take Kihyun somewhere far away from us, so that I don’t have to hear your annoying shrieking.”The boy finished with a stern look and proceeded to take his spot across Jin while Chanyeol mumbled.“ You bastard, you know I am older than you and yet you keep ordering me around.”But when the Slytherin boy sent him that cold death-look, Chanyeol looked like a frightened puppy and pulled Kihyun as far away from them as possible.Jin looked at the boy sitting across him who smiled and said.“ Ah finally, some peace and quiet. I was hoping to run into you anyways. I love those guys, but you suit me much more when it comes to spending longer hours with someone.”Jin just nodded , unable to open his mouth, too afraid that he would not be able to make a simple sentence in front of his crush.Great, just what he needed, being stuck for 6 hours in a small compartment car with Min Yoongi, his adorable and cool crush who had just said how Jin suits him.He wondered if there was some sort of spell to prevent your heart from jumping out of your chest, because he was sure that that was going to be his fate soon enough.It didn’t help his restless heart when Yoongi wanted to show him some new lyrics he was working on and asked him to sit next to him.He was careful of their thighs not touching when he sat next to him, and he tried to keep some distance between them, as Yoongi was looking at his scroll where golden ink was constantly moving as Yoongi kept changing the lyrics with his wand, rearranging them in various ways, too focused on his work to notice that Jin’s attention was now on him instead of his lyrics.He was tracing every feature on Yoongi’s face, the slope of his nose, the shadow his eyelashes casted on his pale cheeks, the sharpness of his jawline, the rose colour of his lips ( one of his favourite colours ever since his gaze first flickered towards Yoongi’s lips), and he cursed himself for not spending more time this morning on his appearance, instead being too tired to even apply some bb cream.He must have looked horrible with his bare-face and small purplish shadows underneath his eyes from a restless night, worrying about vampires, and he was at least glad that his hair was pretty tamed and fluffy.That smell that he got so used to during these past 2 months of his acquaintance with Yoongi, the smell of cologne mixed with pineapple, made him feel relaxed and he closed his eyes inhaling it and feeling exhaustion catching up to him. When he opened his eyes again, he felt like a few seconds had passed since he had closed them, but the position he was currently in, was telling him otherwise.Okay, calm down, there must be a perfectly good explanation why my head is now in Yoongi’s lap.He flinched a bit when he felt slender fingers gently and slowly, almost lazily, running through his hair, making him unconsciously lean into the soothing touch.At that moment the fingers stopped their movement in his hair, and he heard a husky voice above him ask.“ Slept well?”He sat up straight, and Yoongi removed his fingers from his hair casually, as if it was no big deal that they were there in the first place and looked at him lazily and said.“ You fell asleep on my shoulder and I didn’t want you to be uncomfortable, so I placed you on my lap. Anyways, I am going to sleep for a while, wake me up when we get there.”and then Yoongi closed his eyes.Jin stared at him in disbelief.How could he be so calm when Jin’s heart was practically on the verge of running around in his chest and screaming from joy.Oh right, that is because Yoongi just saw him as a friend, so his heart rate was normal.It was normal for him to place Jin’s head on his lap, because he was just being a good friend, not wanting Jin to wake up with an ache in his neck.He slumped in his seat, the joy he felt being replaced by a dull pain in his chest.Why did he have to fall for Min Yoongi?Just, why…He let out a loud sigh, unaware of the pair of eyes watching him, before he left the compartment cart to clear his head.He went to see Namjoon and Hoseok since the Head Boy wasn’t patrolling the corridor anymore, so he managed to forget about the painful feelings he was experiencing for awhile.After about an hour spent in joking with his friends, he decided it was time to go back to his cart.Surprisingly, it was empty.Huh, Yoongi must have gone to Chanyeol and Kihyun to hang out a bit.Well, maybe it’s better like that.After about 10 minutes, the blonde came back, his eyes slightly widening, before he regained his usual impassive expression.“ Uhm, I brought food.”He said quietly and Jin looked up, only to be met with a nervous Yoongi who seemed unsure about something as he was biting his lower lip, with a plate filled with various food in his arms, raised towards Jin.“ F-for me?”Jin asked surprised and Yoongi looked at him, the anxiousness visible in his eyes as he said.“ Yeah, I didn’t know if you ate, or not, and besides I know how you are always hungry, so when I was taking my food, I also took some for you too.”God, why was he so perfect, and why was I acting like an idiot?“ Thanks, Yoongi.”He said with the warmest voice possible, his eyes softening as he looked at the blonde and Yoongi looked at him, surprised, his lips slightly parted, before he grinned and cleared his throat.“ No problem, let’s eat.”Jin knew that Yoongi always did that when he was embarrassed about something although Jin couldn’t figure out why Yoongi was embarrassed now, but he didn’t care, too happy that he was eating and too happy that Yoongi was so thoughtful, no matter that it was just as a friend.He needed to stop being such an insecure guy.Either he was going to confess his feelings to Yoongi, or just try to get over him, so that he wouldn’t ruin their friendship.The whole trip went pretty okay, well if he was to leave out the fact when he and Hoseok were going through Count Dracula’s castle, holding hands so tight that Jin was sure he lost the feeling in his left hand, but none of them paid attention to it, both of them too scared when they got lost in the castle and got separated from their group. The worst part was when someone from behind them placed hands on both of their necks, whispering.“ Boys, are you ready to have your blood sucked?”Scaring  both of them shitless and causing them both to let out inhuman screams.They were both running so fast without even looking back that somehow they managed to find their way out of the castle, their faces completely flushed, both of them completely breathless, but safe. It wasn’t until they were back at the hotel that they found out from Namjoon that some freshman decided to prank them while the other recorded all of it and then showed it to everyone.Needless to say, they became the laughing stock of the trip.But, if Jin was to be completely honest, maybe he should thank those brats for humiliating the like that.Because of that, something strange happened between Yoongi and him that night in the hotel.He was rooming with Namjoon which was horrible, because Namjoon snored.A lot.Honestly, it was so bad that Namjoon told him and Hoseok that one night he got startled by his own snoring and woke up, because of it.Of course, Hoseok was quicker than Jin when they were supposed to pick their roommates and he managed to grab some poor Ravenclaw boy, leaving Jin to room with Namjoon.He tried to sleep, he really did, but after an hour of tossing and turning with Namjoon sleeping in the bed next to his so peacefully that you would think he looked like an angel, well if only it wasn’t for the horrible sounds coming out of his mouth, he decided that he couldn’t take it anymore.He got out of bed, and left his room, dressed only in his black sweatpants and a white plain v-line T-Shirt.He remembered seeing a huge balcony on the third floor, so he went there.As soon as he stepped on the balcony, he felt better, breathing in the fresh air and stretching his arms with his back making a small cracking sound.“ Jin?”He heard a voice next to him and he turned to his right, only to see his crush in jeans and a black tank top exposing his pale, muscular arms streaked with pale blue veins, staring at him surprised.“ Yoongi, what are you doing here?”Jin asked, equally surprised to see him here in the middle of the night.Yoongi started approaching him and when he was next to him, placing his hands on the edge of the balcony, mimicking Jin’s pose, he said in a nonchalant voice.“ Couldn’t sleep. It’s too early for me to go to bed, and I was lacking inspiration for a song, so I came up here to clear my head a bit. What about you?”“ I got stuck with Namjoon as a roommate, and he snores. A lot. I am sure that his snoring can be heard all the way to the lobby.”Jin groaned, and Yoongi chuckled and teased.“ Well, at least you don’t have to worry about him being a vampire and sucking your blood, since they are usually quiet.”Jin stared at him, feeling betrayed, and Yoongi had that shit-eating grin that made Jin feel all warm and fuzzy, but instead he started slapping Yoongi’s chest slightly, whining.“ God, NOT YOU TOO! I thought we were friends!!!”And Yoongi started laughing out loud, with that gummy smile of his, causing the butterflies in Jin’s stomach to go wild until he caught Jin’s hands and pulled him a bit closer, saying.“ Okay, okay, sorry. I just couldn’t resist messing with you.”Normally, Jin would respond back, but currently he was too taken aback.He was pressed up against Yoongi, and their faces were practically a breath away and he could feel Yoongi’s warm breath fawning across his lips and he stared at Yoongi who was still holding his hands and staring at him, his eyes a shade darker than usual.None of them moved, and they both stood there, Jin barely breathing, especially when Yoongi’s gaze flickered to his lips.At that moment Jin’s heart was racing like crazy and then Yoongi’s eyes flew to his lips a few more times and when he licked his lips unconsciously, Yoongi started leaning in.Holy shit!Jin’s breath hitched and he was unable to move, but his brain was going frantic.Is he going to kiss me?!Omg, what should I do?Should I open my mouth?Or maybe that would be weird?Maybe I should keep them closed?But when should I open them, and what if our teeth collide, God I would die of embarrassment.Cursed be me and my romantic side for wanting to have my first kiss with someone special, because now I am freaking out.Why didn’t I take up Hoseok’s offer a few months ago when he offered to teach me how to kiss?Ew, ew, I can’t believe I actually thought of that, omg, me and Hoseok kissing just ew, no, what the hell, why am I even thinking of that, when Min-Freaking-Yoongi’s lips are just a few millimeters away from mine.Okay, calm down, you can do this.He was just about to close his eyes and let go, when a loud slam made them both flinch and Yoongi jumped away.The door of the balcony slammed, because of the wind and when Jin looked at Yoongi , he saw Yoongi staring at him with such a strange look, it was one Jin had never seen before, it was as if regret and pain were mixing in his eyes and before Jin could say anything Yoongi quickly muttered.“ Shit, sorry.”And rushed away, leaving Jin all alone with his thoughts and all of his insecurities resurfacing.He felt a lump in his throat and he had no idea what had just happened.All he knew was that Min Yoongi regretted wanting to kiss him, and that hurt, a lot. The rest of the trip passed in a blur for Jin.He was always with Hoseok and Namjoon and they noticed that he was not in a good mood, but they knew that he would talk about it if he wants to.What was there to talk about, though?About his crush, regretting that he was almost about to kiss him?Hah.And also, now when they were back in Hogwarts, and a few days passed, Jin was sure of one more thing.Not only did Yoongi regret it, but he was also avoiding Jin.Not only did they not text each other, but also Yoongi was nowhere to be seen, ditching most of the classes they had together, and sure it might be that he overslept, but when Jin saw him one day in the hallway and Yoongi also saw him, he widened his eyes at Jin and then turned around and went the other way.Jin stood in the same spot in the hallway for about 10 minutes trying to comprehend what had happened, but it was as clear as day-Yoongi ran away from him.And the worst part was that Jin didn’t even know what he did wrong, and that made him hurt, but mostly angry.For so long he had tried to suppress his crush, so that their friendship would not be in jeopardy, and the one time that Min Yoongi showed any signs of wanting to be with him, he pulled away and now even ran away.Was he really going to act that way towards him?Jin felt like crying, but mostly from anger, but he didn’t allow himself to shed any tears on that guy, because he did nothing wrong. In his depressed state, he had even agreed to come to one of Hoseok’s shameless party which was being held in the Ravenclaw Tower.He wasn’t even in the mood to get dressed up, so Hoseok rummaged through his closet, throwing a white button up to his  bed as well as some light thigh-ripped skinny jeans, and when Jin got dressed without any enthusiasm, Hoseok even styled his hair, pushing his fringe to the side, revealing his forehead.“ Hey, I know you are bummed out, because of Yoongi, but come on, liven up a bit.”Hoseok said when they were about to enter the tower and Jin really loved his friends for being so caring despite his moody behavior this few days, so he smiled and said.“ Thanks, Hobi. I will.”“ Great, now let’s go!”Hoseok yelled enthusiastically and they stepped into the Ravenclaw Tower.Jin scanned the sight in front of him.There were drinks flying above his head except that this time it wasn’t controlled like that time in the pub, now most of the drinks were spilling on students who were too drunk already to complain about it, instead just opening their mouths and letting the sticky liquid splash their face and if they were lucky their mouth as well.Hoseok was already shirtless, screaming like a madman and dancing in the middle of the room while the crowd around him cheered loudly and kept spilling their drinks over him and themselves.He spotted Namjoon not far away from him, his eyes dilated a bit, a half-empty glass of wine in his hand as he was enthusiastically talking about the universe and how we are all just insignificant comparing to the vast space around us, to some freshman who was staring at him in awe.Nope.I can’t deal with this shit right now, Jin thought as he shook his head, and left the tower.His feet led him to the Astronomy Tower, once again.When he was there, he could say that he was surprised when he saw the familiar blonde boy sitting on the floor and leaning on the wall, but somehow, deep down, Jin figured he would be there.He could walk away, but he was sick of avoiding problems, so he walked over to the guy until he was hovering above him and said.“ Can I sit here?”Yoongi opened his eyes abruptly and stared at him with shock, but soon recovered and cleared his throat as he answered.“ Yeah.”Jin sat next to him, the silence stretching between them, making him agitated.“ Why are you avoiding me?”He blurted out.“ W-what?! I, am not, I mean, I was busy and…”Yoongi started explaining, but Jin turned to him, staring at him and saying in a serious voice.“ Cut the crap. You were never a liar, so don’t start now.”Yoongi was gaping at him, as if not believing that Jin really told him that.Finally, he took a deep sigh and said.“ You are right, I am sorry. I have been avoiding you. But, it’s not your fault. It’s mine. I almost did something I shouldn’t have.”I knew it, he regrets it.Jin felt his eyes getting teary and now he thought how it might have not been a good idea to ask Yoongi directly about why he was avoiding him.He knew the truth, but getting rejected in person is much harder than he thought.That is why what Yoongi said next, shocked him.“ And ever since then I can’t stop thinking about it. Well, no, that is a lie. Even a few weeks ago, I knew how I felt, but I tried to push that feeling away so as to not ruin our friendship, so as to not lose you, but then you had to look like that on that night, so innocent and cute and freaking beautiful and I almost lost control over myself, until that door slammed and brought me back to reality. Then I saw how shocked you were and I realized how scared you must have been that your close friend tried to force himself on you. So, instead of facing you, like a coward I avoided you, scared of losing you. I am sorry.”Jin could hear how regretful Yoongi felt in the way his voice broke at the end.But, he didn’t care about it, because he was too happy in this moment, trying to keep his voice from bursting out of joy, saying.“ My shock came from the fact that my long-time crush was finally making a move on me, even though I was convinced all this time that my feelings were one-sided, and I kept them to myself so as to not lose you.”He almost bust out laughing when Yoongi turned to him, his eyes and lips wide open, as he watched his wheels turning, until realization hit him and he broke out into that adorable grin and scoffed, saying.“ God, we were so stupid, I can’t believe this.”and Jin giggled.However, his giggles soon died out when Yoongi kept staring at him with a slight smile as he said in a quiet voice.“ Can I finish what I started on the balcony?”And Jin just nodded, his mind already hazy as Yoongi placed a hand on his cheek, his smell intoxicating him as he was leaning in and only when he their lips were almost brushing did Jin remember something and said in a slightly panicked voice.“ Wait!”And Yoongi opened his eyes, his mouth hovering near Jin’s as he frowned and said.“ What is it?”“ I, uh, what if I am no good?”Jin said and bit his lip worryingly.Yoongi was surprised and asked.“ Why would you think that?”“ Because, I have never kissed anyone before…”Jin whispered, his cheeks heating up.Yoongi widened his eyes and asked.“ What? But, you are so gorgeous, how is that possible?”Jin’s heart skipped a beat when Yoongi called him gorgeous, but then he said.“ I wanted it to be with someone special.”And he knew his face was red right now, but the way Yoongi’s gaze softened and the way he said.“ Well, then, believe me, I will make it special for you, because you deserve it~”made all worries fade away from Jin’s head as he whispered “okay” and closed his eyes, almost immediately melting away when Yoongi’s soft lips pressed against his. Oh how many nights has he dreamed about those lips, but now that they were finally there, on his, he realized how much better they were in reality than in his dreams. Yoongi was caressing his cheek with his thumb as he slowly moved his lips against Jin’s and Jin parted them slightly, trying to follow Yoongi’s movement by moving his lips against Yoongi’s in sync as his pulse echoed loudly in his ears.After a while Yoongi slowly pulled away, his hand still on Jin’s cheek, his eyes filled with warmth as he said in a quiet voice.“ How was that?”“ Amazing.”Jin shyly answered and Yoongi chuckled, asking.“ Are you ready for the next stage in kissing?”Jin felt nervous, but also excited, so he nodded and Yoongi smiled, before leaning once more and connecting their lips.This time when Yoongi swiped his tongue over Jin’s lower lip, Jin immediately parted his lips, moving them against Yoongi’s so naturally, that he felt as if they had been kissing for years, but then he got slightly surprised when Yoongi gently slipped his tongue inside of his mouth, and Jin panicked for a bit, not sure what to do, but Yoongi cupped his face with both of his hands, tilting his chin slightly and deepening the kiss, finding Jin’s tongue, inviting it to dance with his, and it was so soft and so new, and this sensation made Jin dizzy when their tongues touched and glided against each other, making Jin gasp from pleasure, before Yoongi broke the kiss, slowly pulling away.Jin’s mind was in a state of confusion, and he snapped out of it only when Yoongi asked him with slight worry.“ Jin, are you okay? Was it too much?”And Jin was thinking, no, it was too little! He needed more of that, so he said.“ I am fine, but can I try and apply what I have learned so far?”Yoongi was surprised at the boldness in his voice, but he grinned and said.“ Sure. It would be my pleasure.”“ No, actually it would be mine.”is the last thing Jin said, before he grabbed Yoongi by the collar and pulled him towards himself, crashing their lips together, causing Yoongi to let out a little surprised gasp, but Jin was feeling too hot at that moment, and his body was burning up, as he moved his lips against Yoongi’s, trying to remember all the things Yoongi did during the kiss that made him feel so good, so he sucked on Yoongi’s lower lip, causing the blonde to let out a little moan, making Jin even more hungry for him, that he unconsciously moved and straddled the blonde who was sitting on the floor, his back against the wall and his hands were now on Jin’s waist while Jin entangled his fingers in those soft locks, pulling at them slightly, causing Yoongi to part his lips in a sort of a gasp which Jin used to his advantage, immediately sliding his tongue inside of the blonde’s mouth, exploring it eagerly, and he wasn’t even aware that he moved his hips against Yoongi’s until the blonde let out a sound that sounded so feral, as Yoongi grunted his name.“ Fuck, Jin.”Jin panicked, thinking that he did something wrong, and he broke the kiss, staring at the blonde with alarmed eyes, asking.“ I am sorry, did I do something wrong?”Yoongi looked at him and let out a chuckle, saying a bit breathless.“ Actually, you did many things right. Too right, if you ask me. You are a quick learner, and I am not sure if I can handle it right now.”Yoongi finished and when he saw Jin’s confused look he gestured towards the position they were in and only then did Jin realize that not only was he straddling Yoongi, but he also grinded him, oh God, he was so embarrassed.He was blushing profoundly as he said.“ I am so s-sorry, I got carried away.”Yoongi chuckled, saying.“ Well, I am glad I have the same effect on you as you have on me.”Before he pulled him in for another deep kiss. Now that Jin looks back, Yoongi was many firsts for him.He was his first real crush. He was his first kiss. His first lover.But, above all Yoongi was his first love.And no matter what, he was the one who changed him forever.And, if Jin was completely honest, he was glad it was Min Yoongi that he fell in love for the first time, because what is better than falling for one of your best friends?
