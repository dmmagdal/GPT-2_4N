Summary
hotch and reid's texts begin to frequently increase in abundance--chaos, perils, and slight angst ensue AU: bits and pieces of every season, tbh. rossi is in the team, henry is alive, and jj and will are married in 2005. so be warned, there are some alterations to the original script.

DM: are you going home? 
SR: is it wrong to say I don't want to? 
DM: it's never too early to get back together 

DM: but just tread lightly 

DM: I won't hesitate to punch his face in if he tried to mess with you again 
SR: oh, that reminds me SR: he said he'll go to movie club with me SR: even if it lacks the entertainment of movies and the consistency of clubs
