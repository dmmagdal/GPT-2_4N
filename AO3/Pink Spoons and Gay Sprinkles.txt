Pink Spoons and Gay Sprinkles

Yoongi doesn’t hate his job - at least he keeps telling himself that -, he much rather prefers the term ‘dislikes it so much that it makes his skin crawl and his insides churn’. In retrospect he doesn’t even exactly remember why he chose to work at an ice cream shop, because, for a fact, there are very few things he dislikes as much as serving customers, or plastering a sickly sweet smile on his face for the entire day.But, sadly, he very much needs money, and he wouldn’t have anything else to do anyway; at least that’s what he keeps telling himself over the course of his 8 hour shift every day from Monday to Friday to help him pull through.He’s in the middle of wiping the counters off when the little bell above the door rings, signaling another customer. He mentally prepares himself, sighing loudly before putting on his 10%-tip-worth smile and turning around.He comes face to face with a boy around his age, who’s sporting firetruck red hair - which oddly suits him -, his eyes hidden behind his sunglasses. Yoongi notes that the boy has very cute, chubby cheeks and very, very plump lips, so before he could think anything even remotely weird he averts his attention back to the variety of ice creams in front of him.Yoongi keeps staring at the boy expectantly, until he realizes that he hasn’t even asked the question that he knows oh so well.“What can I get for you?” the words finally leave his lips, his fake smile as bright as ever.The boy takes off his sunglasses and hangs them on the neck of his t-shirt, the weight of the glasses pulling the material down just enough for Yoongi to be able to quickly glance at the boy’s smooth chest. He feels heat rising to his cheeks, so he hurriedly looks back up with the same questioning look.The redhead scans through the flavours, suddenly snapping his gaze back on Yoongi, eyes boring into his.“Two scoops of mint chocolate chip in a cup.”It takes every ounce of willpower that Yoongi has to finally look away and reach for the scoop to serve the boy. He quietly plops the ice cream in a cup and very carefully selects a pink plastic spoon just for the hell of it.Yoongi is about to tell the total to the boy, but he doesn’t even get the chance before the redhead audibly gasps and stares at the blonde with such intensity that Yoongi just wants to finally go home.“You want me to eat my ice cream with a pink spoon?! You might as well just shove ten cocks right up my ass!” the boy exclaims rather loudly, and it’s just Yoongi’s luck that two little boys with their parents enter the shop at that exact moment, and Yoongi really wishes he could disappear at that moment.It becomes a staring contest between them, Yoongi’s mouth opening and closing like a fish, the words stuck deep in his throat, but frankly, he’s more irritated than flustered by the boy’s choice of words. It takes a few moments for him to realize that he actually said that because of that stupid plastic spoon, so he turns around with a loud huff and continues wiping the counter.“Well, you can have mine up your ass” he mutters under his breath.Turns out, he said it louder than intended, when he hears a chorus of gasps from behind him this time. He rolls his eyes before turning around and taking in the sight before him. The parents holding their giggling children close, while the boy stares at him with flushed cheeks, and he swears he thinks he’s going to hit him, he can literally see fire burning through the brown of his irises.“What?” Yoongi asks, throwing his hands up in the air in annoyance. “Listen, that fucking pink spoon won’t turn you gay! Do you want another? I can give you a blue one, if you feel that'd be more fitting for your manliness.”Neither of them notices the family storming out of the shop.The boy leaves soon too, finally taking his ice cream - and yes, with the pink spoon, as Yoongi quite rudely told him off and the boy was so offended he left immediately without further nagging Yoongi.He doesn’t show up for a while at the shop after that, but, of course, Yoongi’s happiness doesn’t last long, as the redhead enters the shop exactly a week later. Yoongi’s smile quickly vanishes, the boy eyeing him with an all too friendly smile playing on his lips. The blonde doesn’t question it, instead just asks the usual “what can I get for you?”  in a very bored tone.The redhead replies the same as last time, and Yoongi automatically reaches for a pink spoon, but for his own entertainment he also grabs the rainbow sprinkles and dumps a lot more than needed on top of the ice cream.He pushes the cup towards the boy whose face suddenly drops, and the blonde can actually see annoyance building up inside of him as he keeps staring at his order.“On the house” Yoongi says with a wicked grin, and the redhead doesn’t even complain, Yoongi even swears he can see him hiding a smile.Yoongi is a bit surprised to say the least; he expected something more interesting, maybe even a bit of screaming and throwing more sprinkles at the boy, for fun, of course. But that, sadly, didn’t happen.This goes on for weeks; the boy comes in every few days, places his order and leaves without even as much as making a rude remark.
It’s always the same, Yoongi notes. Two scoops of mint chocolate chip in a cup; he even starts asking for a pink spoon and rainbow sprinkles after a while, though Yoongi doesn’t particularly understand why, since at first it made him yell obscene things in the family friendly environment.It’s always like that, until one day the bell rings again for what seems like the hundredth time, and as soon as Yoongi turns around he sees the same boy, but with dark brown hair instead, which, in his opinion, suits him a bit more.The blonde is about to get the usual before the boy stops him, and instead asks for two scoops of chocolate, of course, with the usual rainbow sprinkles and pink spoon that they both grew so accustomed to.He puts the money down and takes his ice cream, but doesn’t leave, and instead stares at Yoongi with a small smile and a curious look on his face. Yoongi tilts his head in confusion, not really knowing what the boy could possibly want.“What’s your name?” they boy finally asks and Yoongi can only stare at him with his mouth impolitely open, because honestly, out of all things, he was expecting this question the least.After collecting himself, Yoongi answers the quite simple question, but he really doesn’t expect the situation to evolve into an actual conversation that consists of more than a few sentences and carefully placed remarks.They end up talking until Yoongi has to close up, and even then, Jimin - as he learned his name in the span of the last few hours - doesn’t leave, and Yoongi wonders what it is that the boy so desperately wants that he spends hours there. His questions don’t stay unanswered for too long, because as he’s just about to say goodbye when the boy closes his eyes, exhales deeply and then looks up at Yoongi.“Will you go out on a date with me?” Jimin asks, voice weak and trembling with fear - with fear of rejection?Yoongi suddenly feels like the air was knocked out of his lungs, thousands of thoughts rushing to his head, all of them utter nonsense, but at one he has to stop and inspect. Did the pink spoon and rainbow sprinkles actually turn him gay? He just stands there dumbfounded, his eyes widening in surprise, though his own answer might just be as unexpected as the proposal itself.“Yeah,” he mutters, finally letting out a shaky breath that he didn’t know he was holding and smiles - it’s a genuine smile this time - at Jimin. “I’d love to.”-It’s not until a few days later that Yoongi is just about to leave the shop when he spots Jimin outside, already waiting for Yoongi’s shift to end. He’s sitting on a bench right in front of the building, and Yoongi says goodbye to his co-worker before stepping out into the late summer heat. Jimin looks up on instinct when he hears the door open and a smile instantly stretches across his lips when he sees that it’s Yoongi. He gets up from the bench and shyly stares at his shoes, a pink hue appearing on his cheeks when the blonde stops next to him and greets him with a quiet ‘hi’.Jimin fights the urge to hold Yoongi’s hand as they start walking towards Jimin’s apartment that he shares with his best friend, Taehyung, who, according to Jimin, won’t be there, but even if he is, he won’t bother them, so Yoongi shouldn’t worry. Jimin keeps rambling on about small things, and Yoongi finds it really cute how nervous the boy is, but he gently links his fingers with Jimin’s to make him feel more at ease.Jimin furiously blushes at the contact, abruptly stopping in the middle of his sentence to glance down at their hands, and the sight in itself makes his heart swell and a small grin finds its way on his face. His actions don’t go unnoticed by Yoongi who smiles at the boy warmly.They soon arrive at the apartment, and Jimin curses under his breath as his shaky hands won’t let him open the damn front door, which makes Yoongi chuckle.However, Jimin’s problem is solved as the door suddenly opens from the inside, and they come face to face with a tall boy with orange hair, who’s wearing a sweater with holes and cuts everywhere. He pulls it off oddly well, even the carrot coloured hair, Yoongi thinks to himself as he keeps switching his gaze between Jimin and the boy standing in the door.Yoongi soon recovers from the initial shock and slightly bows before muttering his name. The boy’s mouth forms an ‘o’ shape as Yoongi’s words finally reach him and his lips stretch in a box shaped smile.“Nice to finally meet you!” the boy says while glancing at Jimin, who blushes at his words. “I’ve heard a lot about you. Come on in!”The boy disappears inside and Yoongi looks questioningly at Jimin, who looks equally as puzzled, but quickly collects himself and clears his throat.“Well, it looks like you just met Taehyung.”The rest of the afternoon goes relatively smoothly, apart from the fact that Taehyung forgot to go shopping, even though Jimin asked him about ten times, so he has to improvise and instead they just end up ordering takeout, which is fine by Yoongi, but Jimin, on the other hand looks disappointed that he couldn’t show off his cooking skills.It’s not until a few hours later that they’re in the middle of the second movie of the night, when Yoongi notices that Jimin had fallen asleep, his head lolling onto Yoongi’s shoulder as he stirs a bit, moving closer to Yoongi, one of his arms flailing around his middle.Yoongi feels himself blushing at the boy’s actions, but he doesn’t move to push him off, not wanting to bother him. And he has to admit, that Jimin does look cute when he’s asleep, as creepy as that sounds.It does surprise him that Jimin had managed to fall asleep on their first date, but Yoongi wasn’t bothered by this at all, which he also found weird.Yoongi leans his head on Jimin’s and gently drapes his arm around the boy’s shoulder just as the front door opens, and Taehyung, who had disappeared during the first movie, walks in with the groceries that Jimin asked for two days ago it turns out.Taehyung drops the bags by the door as he spots them on the couch cuddled close to each other and coos at them with a box shaped smile.He walks up to them and crouches in front of Jimin, hands reaching towards his chubby cheeks to pinch them, but Yoongi slaps his hand away with a quiet laugh, and Taehyung giggles at his actions before standing up and muttering something about how cute they are while picking up the groceries to put them away in the kitchen.By the end of the second movie Yoongi is out too, lightly snoring with his head still on Jimin’s, their limbs now messily tangled together.Taehyung might’ve taken a few pictures of them on Jimin’s phone, because he thought they looked really, really cute, but he’d never admit that, he just quietly slipped Jimin’s phone back into his pocket before leaving them on the couch, not even bothering to try and wake them up.The next morning should be awkward, how could it not, after they had both fallen asleep - and Jimin even dribbled on Yoongi’s shirt, but the older didn’t even complain -, but it isn’t.Jimin wakes up first, slightly stirring as his eyelids lazily flutter open and he’s about to close them once again when he notes the stiffness in his neck and generally in his entire body, so he carefully looks around, only to notice Yoongi’s arms still wrapped tightly around him, the older still fast asleep with his mouth slightly open, and Jimin takes a few seconds to admire how peaceful he looks while sleeping, but quickly looks away upon realizing how weird that thought actually is.He tries to carefully peel the blonde’s arms from him, but his grip only tightens, nuzzling his face even more into Jimin’s hair before his eyes snap open, and with a blush on his cheeks he let’s go of the boy and sits up, awkwardly clearing his throat.Jimin giggles at him, and Yoongi feels his face burning as he shyly smiles back at Jimin, and they just sit there for a while quietly until Jimin asks if he would like something for breakfast, and Yoongi is about to answer with a polite ‘no’ when his stomach growls quite loudly, and Yoongi feels like the pink tint from his cheeks won’t disappear anytime soon.Jimin grins at him and stands up, reaching towards Yoongi to pull him up from the couch too, and with their fingers still linked they proceed into the kitchen where Jimin instructs the boy to sit on one of the stools while he prepares something for breakfast.Yoongi follows the instructions and plops down by the counter and rests his elbow on the cold surface, resting his face in his hands as he looks around in the kitchen, noticing how tidy everything is, despite the fact that two boys live there by themselves, and needless to say, he’s quite impressed.He pulls his phone out of his pocket to check the time; it’s only 9 in the morning, and it’s a Saturday, so he smiles to himself as he realizes that it’s finally the weekend and so he can finally rest.He turns his eyes back to Jimin whose back is currently facing him as he skillfully works on their meal, seemingly very focused on the task.They silently finish their breakfast when Jimin’s ready with it, occasionally stealing glances at each other, and every time Yoongi catches a glimpse of Jimin’s eyes trained on him he feels something in the pit of his stomach and his heart flutters a bit, the feeling still new, but very pleasant, and Yoongi decides that he likes it.A while later they’re standing in the front door, Yoongi getting ready to leave and Jimin just intently watches as he gathers his belongings and then turns back to Jimin to finally say goodbye.“Thank you for the date” he smiles at Jimin, his whole face lighting up. “It was really nice to get to spend some time with you.”Jimin just weakly nods, taking glances at Yoongi’s lips, but quickly lets go of that thought and instead just pulls him in for a tight hug and mutters a ‘thank you’ while affectionately burying his face in the crook of Yoongi’s neck.Jimin lets go of Yoongi all too soon, and the blonde already misses his touch and the warmth of his body, but doesn’t say anything, just raises his hand to wave as he disappears down the hallway in the direction of the elevator.Jimin closes the door and leans his back against it, having to bite down on his lip to keep himself from smiling too big, and he doesn’t even notice Taehyung watching him from a few feet away.“That was so fucking adorable” he hears Taehyung mutter before he walks off, quietly giggling at Jimin.-From that day their Fridays become like this, Jimin waiting for Yoongi in front of the shop, then going back to his apartment, ending up watching a movie and then falling asleep on each other, and it becomes so natural for them to do so that none of them realizes how hard they’ve fallen for each other as their touches become more intimate, the feeling lingers on their skin, but none of them actually makes a move, so Taehyung decides to step in, because he concludes that it can’t go on like this forever. He just can’t bear watching them stare at the other so lovingly while they’re not looking, so he takes the matter into his own hands, which might not be professional, but still better than waiting for them to finally do something on their own.The next Friday rolls around, and Taehyung can’t wait for Saturday morning, but even after hours, Jimin doesn’t return to their shared apartment, and Taehyung’s quite disappointed to say the least.It’s not until midnight that he hears the familiar click of the front door and someone stumbles in with hushed giggles, nearly falling over a pair of shoes left in front of the door.He carefully glances in the direction of the front door and notes that it is in fact Jimin and Yoongi, and wait, are they drunk?Taehyung raises his eyebrows, an amused expression on his face as he watches them stumble towards the living room.The couple settles on the couch, Jimin pressing his body against Yoongi’s, both of them breaking out in a fit of high pitched giggles. However, their laughter soon dies down and they turn their head to look at each other.Taehyung can’t help but continue watching them from his hiding spot, and he kind of feels bad for spying on them, but he also hopes that they’ll finally do something, even of both of them is a bit tipsy, he’s more than a 100% sure that neither of them would regret it, after all, he’s been watching them for weeks, and he’s pretty sure everyone’s rooting for them by now.Taehyung internally groans when nothing happens even after a few minutes, but he keeps inspecting them, keeping his hopes high up.A few seconds pass before he hears someone speak, and he leans closer, just to make sure that he doesn’t miss anything.
“Can I…” Jimin trails off as he keeps his eyes glued on Yoongi’s lips, and the older can only nod breathlessly as Jimin leans in, their lips barely touching before the older places his hand on Jimin’s neck, tangling his fingers in his short hair, and pulls him closer.Taehyung has to clamp a hand over his mouth to keeps himself from squealing, because fucking finally. He quietly retreats to his room and closes his door with a soft click before letting himself jump in the air and quietly scream, feeling a bit relieved for not having to yell at them to jesus christ just kiss already, even though he was planning on it, and he would’ve enjoyed doing so, but right now he’s just happy that they did it on their own.He looks out again after a few minutes, only to see Jimin straddling Yoongi, his legs on either side of his hips, their bodies melting together in a hot mess, and Taehyung wasn’t actually expecting them to go this far, and he wasn’t planning on seeing this much, because now he can’t erase the picture from his mind, and it feels really gross to have the image of his best friend having his tongue down someone’s throat, so he violently shakes his head, trying to get rid of it as soon as he can.He can’t.-The next morning he finds them sprawled out on the coach on top of each other, and thank god they’re still fully clothed.Scenes from last night pop into his head and he rubs at his temples before the memories get too intense, and instead decides that he’ll be nice and makes them breakfast for when they wake up.While Taehyung is busy in the kitchen Jimin wakes up on top of Yoongi, and finds that he dribbled on his shirt again, but then the realization that he’s on top of Yoongi hits him, and he tries really hard to remember how they ended up here, but the last thing he can remember is leaving the bar with a beer still in his hand.He doesn’t move to get up, just lets his eyes close again and listens to Yoongi’s heartbeat, relishing in the warmth of his body.A while later he hears Yoongi hum quietly as his arms wind around Jimin’s frame to pull him closer and he can feel Yoongi’s hot breath on the top of his head as it’s tucked under Yoongi’s chin.Taehyung walks out of the kitchen catching them sleepily talking and he notices how they’re holding hands to which he only smiles before clearing his throat to inform them that breakfast is ready and disappears back in the kitchen.Jimin carefully climbs off of Yoongi and helps him up too, not letting go of his hand as they walk into the kitchen after Taehyung, who greets them with a knowing smirk as he places their bowls in front of them.Jimin raises an eyebrow at Taehyung’s expression, but doesn’t question it, Yoongi, on the other hand can’t help but let a ‘what?’ leave his lips when Taehyung won’t stop sweetly smiling at them.“Oh, it’s nothing.” But his smile turns into a box shape, so Yoongi keeps glaring at him. “Did you have fun last night?” Taehyung asks as he turns back to the counter to tidy up after having finished cooking.They both look at him with wide eyes, but his back is still turned to them until he glances back at them over his shoulder upon not receiving an answer, catching them still staring at him with a questioning and slightly scared look to which he only answers with an amused giggle.“Taehyung?” Jimin says, voice laced with concern, only having faint memories from last night.“Don’t worry, Jimin-ah, you guys just finally progressed in your blooming relationship, and I didn’t even have to step in!”The couple just stares at him as he happily dances around in the kitchen, their mouth hanging open as they try to process his words.“Tae, w-what do you mean by that?” Jimin is slightly paler than usual as he waits for the answer, not really knowing if he actually wants to hear it or not.Taehyung rolls his eyes before answering,“You just kissed, maybe made out for a bit, not that big of a deal, I mean, it was bound to happen, anyone can see that just by looking at you two.”Jimin and Yoongi can both feel heat rising to their cheeks, but they can’t really decide if it’s because Taehyung had seen them, or because they kissed while they were both slightly under the influence of alcohol, and Jimin decides that it doesn’t bother him in the slightest bit.Taehyung loudly exclaims that he’ll leave them alone because he has places to be, but none of them notices the front door opening and closing, they both just silently stare at the counter, waiting for the other to break the silence.“Hyung?” Jimin looks at him, too nervous to wait longer.The older just hums, waiting for Jimin to continue, not even looking up at him, and Jimin get’s more worried with every second, his hand clammy and slightly shaking, trying to prepare himself for asking his question.“Do you- do you regret it?”He can feel his eyes starting to water, though he doesn’t really know where the sudden rush of anxiety came from, he knows that Yoongi likes him, but the thought that he might feel bad about last night’s happenings scares him.He watches intently as Yoongi shifts in his seat, and his heart is beating so violently in his chest by now it’s the only thing he can hear in the deafening silence.Yoongi finally looks up at Jimin, and instantly notices his trembling lower lip and the tears forming in his eyes and worry settles on his face as he leans closer and gently cradles Jimin’s cheeks in his hands, his thumbs brushing away the tears rolling down his flushed cheeks and he realizes how much it must’ve meant to Jimin if he reacts like this.“No, no, Jimin, why would you even think that?” he asks gently, his thumbs gently drawing circles, trying to calm Jimin down. “The only thing I regret about it is that I don’t remember now, but I could never feel even slight remorse because of it, okay?”Jimin quickly nods his head, still shaking a bit as he tries to keep his sobs in, and Yoongi’s heart aches as he pulls Jimin closer until his head is lying on his chest and gently hugs the trembling boy, but soon realizes that the position is very uncomfortable, so he advises moving back to the living room, to which Jimin only nods.Jimin moves to sit down beside Yoongi on the couch, but the older pulls him on his lap, Jimin’s legs dangling off at one side and Yoongi hugs him tightly, gently pressing a kiss to the crown of his head.“I didn’t mean to scare you like that, I’m so sorry Jiminnie.”The younger stares up at him, eyes still glossy from crying, but a bright smile suddenly appears on his lips and Yoongi can’t help but sigh in relief and smile back at him.A while later Yoongi finds that Jimin fell asleep on his lap, so he gently lays him on the couch and smiles down at the peaceful sight in front of him.A heavy sigh leaves his lips as he reaches for his bag by the door when he hears Jimin’s quiet voice.“Hyung, are you leaving?”So Yoongi stays.-Months pass, and they’re back in school, but Friday afternoons are always theirs, not being able to stay away from each other for too long, even 5 months into their relationship.They had made it official 2 months after dating, which, of course, made Taehyung scream a bit in excitement, and Jimin was really glad to have a bestfriend like him, because he could always rely on him and vice versa, and the thought in itself always put a huge smile on his face.Nothing really changes besides Taehyung finding a boyfriend too; ha started dating Jeongguk around 3 months ago, but everyone could see how happy they made each other, and they clicked so well from the first second that Jimin was pretty sure they were actually soulmates.And now, as November rolls around, Taehyung is out with Jeongguk when Yoongi and Jimin reach the all too familiar apartment, their cheeks rosy from the cold outside, but they don’t forget to keep each other warm as Jimin presses Yoongi against the front door while fumbling with his keys, which proves to be very hard while Yoongi reaches up to leave kisses all over his jawline and move down to nip at the soft skin of his neck, inhaling his scent that was just so Jimin to him, and he could never get tired of it.Jimin finally opens the door and they tumble inside, still pressed tightly together, and Jimin doesn’t even bother to lock the door, just kicks it shut as they stumble towards his bedroom, throwing their coats carelessly on the floor, their lips still locked, the only sound being Jimin’s whimpers as Yoongi harshly tugs on his bottom lip, and they finally reach the bedroom.Jimin wastes no time to push Yoongi down on the bed and crawl on top of him, eagerly kissing down his neck, making sure to leave some pretty purple marks too, before tugging at the hem of Yoongi’s shirt, urging him to take it off, and Yoongi complies, quickly pulling it over his head and flinging it somewhere in the room.Jimin drags his lips down Yoongi’s chest, leaving a wet trail behind, but stops at his jeans, moving his head lower, his hot breath fanning over Yoongi’s clothed erection before he leans down, mouthing at it, and he finally hears Yoongi let out a small moan.Jimin suddenly stops and leans back to Yoongi’s face to which he replies with an annoyed groan, their lips barely ghosting over each other as Jimin speaks up.“Hyung, do you… do you want this?” he asks breathlessly, peppering kisses all over Yoongi’s face.The blonde throws his head back as Jimin grinds their hips together, a moan escaping his lips, but Jimin patiently waits for his answer before taking it any further.“Y-yes” he finally stutters.And so Jimin doesn’t stop.-After that, it doesn’t take long for them to finally move in together, the biggest motivation probably being nearly getting caught way too many times by either Taehyung or Jeongguk, and so they move in to a small apartment a few buildings away. No one really questioned their choice, since they spent the majority of their time together anyway, and they both had a job too, so it nearly seemed logical for them to move in together.They only realized how much work it’d be when they couldn’t fit their dining table in the small elevator, and so they had to carry it up to the 3rd floor, which proved to be really difficult, considering how narrow the staircase was, but somehow - they still don’t really know how - they managed to get it to their apartment.It’s not really different from how they lived before, the only thing that changes is that they don’t only get to spend their Friday afternoons and weekends together.Of course, this also leads to them arguing a few times, but it’s always something pointless when one of them is really stressed or tired, and they can’t stay mad at each other for too long, always making up after an hour or so, the silent treatment that both of them usually uses doing wonders as the other clings onto them, muttering how sorry they are, and the entire thing is forgotten after they discuss it properly over a cup of hot tea.They learn more and more about each other with every passing day, and it seems like none of them is going to say those three words.They wouldn’t need it, they know for a fact that they do love each other, but the thought is planted so firmly in Jimin’s head, that after a while it becomes the only thing on his mind.He can’t help but think about how much he loves Yoongi as he watches him do even the simplest tasks, always looking at him with admiration, and Yoongi returns the gestures.Taehyung had not once told them that it’s really adorable how much they love each other and how much he ships them - even though he later had to explain what exactly that means, but, of course, he was more than willing to do so.And as Yoongi is making dinner and Jimin just sits on the countertop next to him, watching him work, he feels the sudden urge to say it loudly, but he doesn’t think this is the perfect moment to do so, so he patiently waits, his heart hammering in his chest.They are finished with their food, just cuddling on the couch together like always, and Jimin feels like he could fall asleep any moment, so he sleepily looks up at Yoongi and quietly mutters his name.Yoongi tears his gaze away from the television and looks down at Jimin, waiting for him to continue.“I love you.” Jimin sheepishly smiles at him, and Yoongi suddenly grins at him, showing all his teeth.“I love you too, Jiminnie” Yoongi whispers before leaning down to press a kiss against Jimin’s forehead.Jimin happily nuzzles his face against Yoongi’s shirt, and dozes off to sleep, not noticing Yoongi’s loving gaze that he can’t tear away from Jimin’s face, a smile still on his lips as he peacefully rests in Yoongi’s arms, and he couldn’t imagine it being any more perfect than this.-“Hey, hyung, do you ever think about how we met?” Jimin asks one night as they’re sprawled out on their bed, their skin clammy with sweat, the scorching heat of June staying even for the nights.“How could I forget?” Yoongi asks, laughing a bit at the memories. “It was nearly exactly 3 years ago, wasn’t it?”“Yeah, our anniversary is in two weeks” Jimin says, his voice suddenly soft.“I remember you got really angry because I gave you a pink spoon-”“And you said that I can have your cock up my ass” Jimin giggles rather loudly and wiggles his eyebrows at Yoongi who groans in response, but also can’t help but laugh.“Did you actually get that angry because of that spoon though?” Yoongi muses loudly.“No, I was just really stressed I think, but it’s really funny in retrospect, isn’t it?”A smile constantly stays on their lips as they keep talking about the memories so fondly, and despite the heat Yoongi let’s Jimin curl up next to him, and it is a bit gross, their skin now sticky with sweat, but they stay like that.It’s around 4 a.m. when they finally feel tired enough to even attempt sleeping, but before either of them could doze off Jimin breaks the peaceful silence.“I love you, Yoongi.”“I love you too, Jimin.”
