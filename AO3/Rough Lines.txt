Rough Lines
by SongMaelin
Summary
Somewhere along the line, Yoongi had gained a bit of a reputation. Somewhere along the line, Jungkook fell for him.
Notes
So, when I started writing this, Jungkook was still underage and I had set this story to take place in the future... That is how long this has been a work in progress. Ah well, I finally finished it. It was supposed to just be pwp but somehow a little bit of story slipped in there, oops.



Rough Lines

Somewhere along the line, Yoongi had gained a bit of a reputation. It started even before he became a rapper, but once he debuted as ‘Suga’ those ideas only increased in number. Suga was tough. Suga was confident. Suga didn’t give a fuck about anything or anyone. Suga was as rough in personality as he was in voice. Suga was unapproachable and rude. The only things Suga liked were music and sleep... maybe food. Yoongi never cared to correct people. In fact, he had even gone out of his way to affirm those ideals from time to time.


Min Yoongi was very different from Suga. He wasn’t much of a people person on the best days... but he wasn’t as rude as most people seemed to think. He wasn’t afraid to be rough with other people, and he wasn’t bothered if people were rough with him, but that didn’t mean that it was a common occurrence either way. Min Yoongi liked smooth songs with slow beats. Min Yoongi was nervous and easily embarrassed. Min Yoongi had the same amount of confidence as he had coffee in his empty cup as he thought about this.


Although it wasn’t always easy to keep up, Yoongi played along. In public, he acted as Suga, the Daegu-city rapper who didn’t give a shit. Once he got home though... once the cameras and fans were gone, he relaxed into the Min Yoongi that only his close friends and fellow members knew.


Even though the members knew Yoongi better than most people, it was still confusing at times to see him act with such polar personalities. They supposed they all acted differently on stage, but his change was the most significant. Still, when they asked about it and all he gave them was a sigh and a half-assed explanation, they just went with it. What did it really matter, anyways? The only people who it really bothered were the youngest and the oldest, after a while.


Jin wasn’t really sure why it bothered him. He felt sorry maybe, or maybe concerned, that the younger had decided to act this way. He didn’t miss how exhausted it made Yoongi. Just being an idol alone was tiring, they all knew that. Adding on to that the general lack of sleep Yoongi got every night and having to keep up appearances everywhere he went... it was no wonder people always caught him sleeping in waiting rooms and the such. It was because of that that people assumed he slept a lot, but in reality the amount of sleep Yoongi got was scarily minimal. That was what bothered Jin the most, he guessed. Yoongi was guarding himself with this persona, and he forgot sometimes to take care of his actual self.


Jungkook on the other hand knew why it bothered him. Even shortly after they had met, he had begun admiring the older male. He admired him for his rapping and song-making skills. He admired his determination and confidence when performing. He admired his overall self-sufficient attitude. When they got closer and he learned more about him, he found he actually liked the true Yoongi more. Yoongi cared about more than he let on, and he was subtle about his attentions to the younger members. It was something else for Jungkook to admire.


As time went on, Jungkook started picking up on the little things. He started picking up on the way Yoongi would tense just that slightest bit when he saw a camera. He started picking up on the way Yoongi would sigh softly as he sank into his bed after too long a day. He started picking up on the way Yoongi would mutter quietly in concentration when he was working on a song. He started picking up on the way Yoongi would smile shyly and turn away whenever he was complimented.


Jungkook loved that the most, and he found himself complimenting the rapper more just to see his flustered expression.


Eventually, Jungkook had to admit that it was more than admiration for the older male. Other people had noticed too. He paid more attention to Yoongi than the other members at most times, even though he tried to hide it. He always gave the elder plenty of compliments, and was the first to volunteer if Yoongi needed help. He spent almost as much time scolding Yoongi for his unhealthy sleeping and eating habits as Jin did, despite being the youngest.


Honestly, Jungkook sometimes wondered how Yoongi was the only one to not figure it out. Even Taehyung knew that Jungkook had formed a crush on the rapper, but somehow Yoongi himself remained oblivious. He questioned Jungkook about it sometimes, especially whenever Jungkook would compliment him out of the blue or offer to give him a massage. He never got an answer. Jungkook would insist that it wasn’t cowardice that prevented him from telling the truth, but more just that Jungkook loved seeing Yoongi so confused.


“You know there aren’t any cameras around right? You don’t have to pretend to be a good maknae.” Yoongi scoffed as Jungkook sat down next to him on the floor, asking if he wanted a shoulder massage. He would say this every time, even though Jungkook’s response never changed.


“I’m not pretending. I just want to make sure you aren’t hurting... I know dancing is harder for you than it is for me.”


Yoongi glared at him but there was no bite to the gaze. Even during practices, Yoongi acted as Suga, just in case, but the younger boy could tell that he was starting to relax as the day went on. Without waiting for his response, Jungkook stretched his fingers over Yoongi’s shoulders, like he had done plenty of times before. He would like to think that he’s gotten quite good at it, if the way Yoongi started to lean into his touch was any indication.


After a few moments, a contented noise slipped from Yoongi’s lips and Jungkook cracked a smile. Admittedly, his motive for giving the rapper these shoulder rubs was a little selfish. He enjoyed the happy sighs that were only loud enough for him to hear. He liked the peaceful face that his hyung wore. He liked the way Yoongi relaxed and leaned against him.


“You’re so small, hyung.” Jungkook muttered, the words falling out without his consent. It was something he noticed when they first met, but it seemed like Yoongi had only gotten smaller since debut.


“Yeah, well not everyone gets a growth-spurt like yours.” Yoongi bit, the maliciousness in the comment melting away weakly.


“I wasn’t talking about your height.” Jungkook chuckled, knowing that Yoongi was so bitter the day they found out Jungkook had grown taller than him. Now, the only member shorter than Yoongi was Jimin. At least at one point in time he had been taller than Jungkook, but that was so long ago. “You should really eat more. It’s not healthy to be so small, hyung.”


“Aren’t you a little young to be scolding me about my health?”


“You’re only saying that because you know I’m right. I’m only four years younger than you, you know.”


“I was walking and speaking before you were even born. I’d say that’s a pretty significant difference.” Realistically, Yoongi knew it wasn’t that big a difference. Maybe if they were still children, but seeing as they were both adults, it didn’t much matter. Even so, just as Jungkook liked teasing him about his height, he liked teasing Jungkook about his age. He was sure that they could both be over fifty and he’d still tease him.


The conversation faded as Jungkook failed to respond. It wasn’t that Jungkook didn’t have anything to say, he just found that none of it was worth saying. His hands slipped down from Yoongi’s shoulders to his hips, wrapping around the worryingly small waist. As much as Jungkook and Jin scolded Yoongi already, Jungkook just didn’t understand how to convince the older to take better care of himself.


Jungkook rested his chin on Yoongi’s shoulder. It was really too hot for him to be wrapped around the rapper like this, but he didn’t care. They had been sitting long enough to cool down at least a little bit by now anyways. If Yoongi minded it, he didn’t say anything, just letting the maknae rest against him.


Much too soon for either of their likings, they were called to continue practicing. Yoongi slipped out of Jungkook’s grasp and the latter stood up a little begrudgingly. They got into position and followed the steps like they had probably thousands of times already. Jungkook intentionally kept Yoongi out of his sight. The older wasn’t a dancer, but he wasn’t bad at dancing. He followed the choreographies well, and Jungkook was sure that if he actually tried, he would be a damn good dancer otherwise.


“When are you going to finally tell him?” Taehyung spoke up as practice ended and they started to file out of the building. Yoongi was only a few steps ahead of them, but luckily Taehyung knew when to speak quietly.


“I don’t know. Never maybe. It’s never the right time.”


“Are you sure you aren’t just scared?”


“I’m not scared. I mean... I’m almost sure that I’d be rejected, so if I’m expecting it...” Jungkook mused, trailing off. “I don’t even know if hyung is gay. The likeliness that he’s not only gay but that he likes me...?”


“So you are scared.”


“I’m not-” he sighed, shaking his head. “I don’t think scared is the right word, hyung. I just... like I said, it’s never the right time. Besides that, I don’t want to burden Yoongi-hyung if he doesn’t like me, which he probably doesn’t.”


“I think you should tell him anyways.” Taehyung shrugged.


“Why?”


“You guys are cute together. Besides, everyone knows you like him. Don’t you think it’s a little unfair that Yoongi-hyung is the only one who’s out of the loop?”


“Well it’s not my fault everyone knows. It’s not my fault he hasn’t figured it out either.”


“It’s your fault for being obvious and it’s your fault for not telling him.”


“Fine, I’ll tell him then. Tomorrow.” Jungkook huffed.


Taehyung gave a triumphant smile and skipped ahead to hassle Jimin and Hoseok, while Jungkook’s steps slowed to a near halt. In his mind, telling Yoongi was something he could have done at any moment, but he just chose not to. When it came down to it though, he wondered if he’d even be able to get the words to pass his lips.

“Hyung... Have you ever kissed a guy?”


Jungkook and Yoongi were playing video games while the other members were off doing who knows what when Jungkook spat out the question. He had told Taehyung he’d confess today, and he would... but he needed to find a way to build up to it. Belatedly, he realized that asking a question like that out of the blue wasn’t the best way to go about it, but his mind wasn’t as quick as his mouth, apparently.


“No. Why?” Yoongi answered easily, not even seeming to be phased.


“Have you ever wanted to?”


“I’ve never thought about it. Why?”


“I just... was watching some video the other day. You remember when Hoseok-hyung and Taehyung-hyung kissed?”


“Yeah, I guess...” Yoongi replied pensively. He didn’t get where the kid was trying to head with this conversation, but he tried to follow along anyways.


“You pushed their heads together.” Jungkook mentioned with a nervous chuckle.


“Yeah. I did. So? I did it to be funny.”


“No, of course. I mean... I know. I was just curious. They seemed to hate it a lot... I was just wondering if you’d hate it too.”


“Why we’re you wondering if I’d hate it? What would it matter?” Yoongi asked, pausing the game and setting his controller down.


He sat forward a bit and turned to look at the younger male. He could tell he was trying to say something, but he couldn’t figure out what it was. Jungkook was stuck staring at the buttons on his controller, flicking the thumb-stick lightly. He could feel Yoongi’s eyes on him, and that was kept him from looking up.


“I don’t think I’d hate it.” He spoke finally, his voice waning out in the end.


“What was that?”


“I... I don’t think I’d hate it.” He repeated a bit louder.


“No?”


“No... so... I wanted to know... if you’d hate it.”


“Like I said, I’ve never thought about it.”


Yoongi sat back again, grabbing his controller and slouching into the couch. After a moment, they started playing again and Yoongi assumed the conversation had been dropped. It was only a match later that Jungkook spoke up again, however.


“If you ever try it, will you tell me if you hate it?”


Jungkook’s eyes didn’t look away from the screen, and to Yoongi it seemed like it was just another off-handed remark. Realistically, Jungkook was putting in so much effort into keeping a straight face, he didn’t think he could turn his head if he tried.


“Sure. If I ever try it, I’ll tell you.” Yoongi answered after a stunned minute.


Jungkook had already won the round, and Yoongi almost suspected that the kid asked that just to distract him from the game. Yoongi had always been better than Jungkook at the game, so the maknae’s victories were few and far between. It wasn’t the first time Jungkook had tried using some weird tactic to beat Yoongi, but this was the first time it actually worked.


Yoongi was even more sure that this was the case when Jungkook leaned over for just a second, giving him a peck on the lips. Yoongi froze, and Jungkook only stayed in the room long enough to finish off his character before fleeing to help Seokjin cook dinner. Yoongi boils the reason down to competiveness in a video game, but that doesn’t stop the blush that peppers his cheeks.


“I don’t hate it.” He whispers, as if to keep his promise even though Jungkook can’t possibly hear him.

“You were supposed to confess!”


“Do you have to shout?” Jungkook hisses, slapping a hand over Taehyung’s mouth. Thankfully, they were alone in the practice room.


He had just told him what happened two days before with him and Yoongi, and he wasn’t really surprised at the response. In his head, kissing the older boy was equivalent to confessing to him, but considering the way he played it off, it didn’t mean much. Considering Yoongi hadn’t even said anything about it afterwards, he was sure that the rapper thought nothing of the kiss. He honestly didn’t know whether he was happy about that or not.


“You said you’d tell him.”


“I... I kissed him!”


“If you don’t tell him, I’m going to.” Taehyung threatened, crossing his arms with a pout.


“Like he’ll even believe you.” Jungkook scoffed. It’s not like Taehyung had a reputation for being dishonest, but he had some crazy ideas, and he was sure the older would brush it off as such.


“I’ll still tell him.”


“Good luck.”


Jungkook rolled his eyes, sitting back against the mirror. It wasn’t that he didn’t believe Taehyung, it’s just that he wasn’t sure he cared either way. Only two things would happen from it. Either Yoongi wouldn’t believe him, and nothing would change, or Yoongi would believe him, in which case anything could happen, but it wouldn’t be any different than if Jungkook were the one to say it. Jungkook meant to say it, but as predicted, he couldn’t get the phrase to pass his lips.


He didn’t expect Taehyung to get up to go find Yoongi right at that moment though. By the time Jungkook had figured out what he was doing, he was already long gone. Jungkook was about to leave the practice room as well when he got back, with Yoongi in tow.


“Taehyung, what are you-” Yoongi started, only to be cut off by the person in question.


“Jungkook has something to tell you.”


“I thought you were telling him.” Jungkook whined quietly. Eventually though, he gave in with a small sigh. “Yoongi-hyung... I... I... uh...” Jungkook’s eyes flicked between Yoongi and Taehyung, almost begging Taehyung to say it for him. “I was hoping you could help me practice my rapping.” He muttered.


“I guess. Why did Taehyung have to-”


“Jungkook likes you and he’s a liar.” Taehyung huffed.


Yoongi gave the younger a strange look, and Jungkook couldn’t tell if he believed him or not. It was silent, and time almost seemed to freeze while the maknae waited for Yoongi to say something, anything, in response. After what felt like a life time, the rapper suddenly spoke.


“It’s been two years since we debuted. If he didn’t like me I’d be wondering how we managed to get along at all during this time.” He answered softly. Jungkook had to have been imagining the blush crossing his cheeks. He had to have been imagining the way Yoongi’s eyes flicked down to watch his shoes. He had to be...


“Hyung...” Jungkook spoke up, stopping Taehyung from doing so. “That’s not what Taehyung-hyung means. I... like you...a lot more than I should.”


Maybe it was the way Yoongi looked up at him. Maybe it was the way that Yoongi’s eyes betrayed his thoughts. Maybe it was the way that Yoongi blushed, even though he clearly didn’t believe the maknae’s words. Maybe it was the way Yoongi’s tongue peeked out as a nervous habit. Maybe it was the way his fingers began to play with the edge of his sweatshirt.


Jungkook wasn’t really sure what made him lean in, but he knew that Yoongi’s lips were soft, and he didn’t ever want to pull away.

It took some time, but eventually, Yoongi got a little bit used to Jungkook’s affections. That’s not to say that he would ever be completely used to it, but at least now, nearly ten long months later, he didn’t flinch every time the maknae wrapped an arm around his shoulders or leaned in to kiss him.


The other members knew about their relationship almost as soon as it happened, courtesy of the one witness, Kim Taehyung. The public, however, remained unaware. Frankly, that was how Yoongi would like to keep it. It wasn’t that he wasn’t proud of his boyfriend, but he really didn’t want fans, or anyone else for that matter, prying into his business more than they already do.


Jungkook on the other hand would have loved to shout it to the world the moment Yoongi admitted to liking him too. Still, he understood the reasons for keeping quiet about it. Even though it annoyed him sometimes, the members kept it between themselves, not even letting the managers know about the couple.


Jungkook didn’t completely hate it though. There was exactly one benefit from the arrangement, in his mind. That was, Yoongi’s reaction whenever Jungkook kissed him in public. Every time it happened, his eyes would go wide and he would quickly whip his head about to see if anyone saw. No one ever did though, because Jungkook would always make sure that even in a public place they were alone, or at least in the type of situation where no one would be able to see if they kissed. He always got scolded for it, but Jungkook didn’t mind, because Yoongi’s cute reaction was always worth it.


The other members didn’t really seem to mind either if they kissed or held hands in front of them. The first time it happened (not including the kiss in front of Taehyung), Jin actually congratulated them with a laugh, despite the relationship having been old news. Skinship between them was almost always initiated by Jungkook, whether a kiss or a hug or Jungkook pulling Yoongi down into his lap when they decided to watch a movie together.


Yoongi had never been really fond of skinship, but he didn’t hate it. At times, he thought about being the one to lean in for that kiss. At times, he wanted to wrap his arms around the maknae and just hold him close. He never did though. His mind always gave him some excuse not to.


It wasn’t really much of a surprise that when they found themselves home alone, Jungkook was the one to initiate things this time too.


They were watching a movie together, wasting time until the other members got home. Yoongi came down with a cold and Jungkook had volunteered to stay home with him while the other members went on with their daily routines. Despite Yoongi’s protests that Jungkook should be nowhere near him while he was sick, the singer pulled him into his arms anyways so they could watch the movie comfortably.


Yoongi would say that it was lack of energy that stopped him from leaving the warmth of Jungkook’s grasp. He’d probably say that it was Jungkook’s warmth alone that led Yoongi to relax into his arms. It had nothing to do with the fact that Yoongi just really liked the way Jungkook felt curled around him.


Yoongi fell asleep like that, his head resting on Jungkook’s shoulder while Jungkook’s arms were wrapped lightly around his waist. When Jungkook turned to see his boyfriend sleeping peacefully, he couldn’t stop the smile that graced his lips. He couldn’t stop himself from leaning forward and pecking his lips either. He knew that if the older was awake, he’d scold him for kissing someone who was sick. Yoongi wasn’t awake however, and Jungkook didn’t care either way.


Jungkook’s fingers started to play with the rapper’s hair. It was something that he had recently learned that Yoongi liked. Yoongi would still usually swat his hand away when he tried it, but Jungkook knew he enjoyed the feeling nonetheless. Yoongi’s hair was soft, so Jungkook enjoyed playing with it too.


“Jungkook...” Yoongi mumbled, just waking up again. “The movie...”


The movie ended almost an hour ago, but Jungkook hadn’t wanted to move and disturb the elder, so he just let it loop through the title sequence. Now that Yoongi was awake, he shifted so that he could reach the remote, turning off the DVD player and choosing some random channel to watch. Yoongi took his time to wake up fully, and when he did he began to scoot away from Jungkook, muttering some excuse about how he still didn’t want to get the singer sick.


“I’m going to get sick either way, hyung. Come here.” Jungkook whined, pulling Yoongi back against him.


“I didn’t mean to fall asleep... Anyways, you might not get sick. You shouldn’t really test it.”


“I probably will. It doesn’t bother me.” He chuckled.


Yoongi pouted at him and he only continued to laugh quietly. Before Yoongi could stop him, Jungkook carded his fingers through Yoongi’s hair and rested his hand on the back of his neck. Holding him in place lightly, he leaned in, sealing their lips again now that Yoongi was awake. Once Yoongi realized what he was doing, he pushed against Jungkook’s shoulders, but it didn’t really work out how he planned.


Jungkook shifted again so that he was on his knees, leaning forward until Yoongi landed on his back with Jungkook hovering over him. Yoongi barely got the chance to take a breath before Jungkook attached their lips again. The hand on Yoongi’s neck slid down his side, stopping to squeeze his hip before traveling further, pulling his thigh up a bit to make room for Jungkook’s leg. Yoongi’s hands continued to try and push Jungkook off of him without much result. Finally, the younger pulled away, resting his forehead in the crook of Yoongi’s neck.


“Do you want to get sick?!”


“Not really, but I wanted to kiss you, so I did. Since I’m pretty much guaranteed to get sick now anyways... can I keep kissing you?”


“This kid...” Yoongi laughed. He had lost, and they both knew it.


Jungkook kissed him again, softly at first but quickly growing aggressive. Almost ten months. It had been almost ten months since they started dating, and they had never done more than kiss. Yoongi was too timid to push things farther, and Jungkook was dreadfully patient. More than anything, he wanted Yoongi to be the one to move things forward, if only to be sure that the older actually wanted this. He was starting to see though that it wouldn’t happen.


Yoongi let out a shaky breath when they parted again and Jungkook’s lips slipped down to his neck. He wanted to get away; He wanted to get closer. He tugged at Jungkook’s hair when the younger bit down lightly on his collarbone. Yoongi nearly choked when he tried to speak, and decided not to bother with words, pulling Jungkook into another kiss instead of trying to scold him. He could feel the laughter that threatened to slip out of the singer.


Slender fingers slipped up under the fabric of Yoongi’s t-shirt. He tensed at the unfamiliar touch, but didn’t stop the younger. Jungkook went no farther than the rapper’s ribs. Recently, Yoongi’s health has only gotten worse, no matter how much Jungkook scolded him. If he didn’t know about it before, he was sure when he could feel how the elder’s skin pulled against his bones. He didn’t understand it, and it frustrated him to no end. His fingers pressed down harshly on the smaller boy’s skin, causing Yoongi’s breath to hitch.


Jungkook mumbled an apology against Yoongi’s lips that he didn’t really mean. How long ago was it that his boyfriend had some definition of muscle? How had that all melted away?


Jungkook’s lips once again left Yoongi’s to travel elsewhere. His jaw, his neck, his collar. He toyed with one of Yoongi’s earrings, flicking it with his tongue briefly before moving on. How upset would Yoongi be if he marked him? It was a tempting thought, but Jungkook thought better of it. He sat up for a moment, pulling at Yoongi’s shirt, silently asking if it was okay to remove. After a moment of hesitation, Yoongi sat up just enough for Jungkook to pull off the shirt and toss it aside.


As thin as he was, Jungkook still couldn’t think that he was anything but beautiful. As if it were his first time seeing it, Jungkook found himself staring. It wasn’t until Yoongi’s arms snaked around himself to block Jungkook’s gaze that he stopped looking. He pulled Yoongi’s arms away, pressing his lips against the skin of Yoongi’s wrist.


Jungkook’s lips trailed up his arm back to his neck. He let out a sharp breath when Yoongi tugged lightly at the collar of his shirt and pulled him back into a kiss. Those same hands then moved down his torso, stopping at his hips where the shirt ended. Jungkook was about to help the rapper remove the clothing when he was stopped.


“W-Wait!” Yoongi stammered, grabbing Jungkook’s hand. “We shouldn’t.”


“Why not?”


“It’s just...”


“Just what? We’ve been dating for close to a year. We’re both adults. I don’t see any reason why we can’t.” Jungkook whined. He knew it was probably childish, that the older probably had a good reason. Once again, he found himself wanting to act selfishly.


“The other guys will probably be home soon. Besides that...”


Jungkook had figured out already what Yoongi was going to say when the latter was interrupted with a coughing fit. He tried not to show his disappointment as he hurriedly went to get Yoongi some water, as well as retrieving his shirt from the floor. Yoongi had a point. It just wasn’t the right time.

Miraculously, Jungkook never got sick. Days had passed and he never showed any sign of a cold. He didn’t fail to brag about it to Yoongi, either. Yoongi didn’t fail to point out that he just got lucky.


After Yoongi recovered from his cold, Jungkook (with the help of Jin) had all but forced food down Yoongi’s throat, insisting that he got sick because he didn’t feed himself enough. He tried to make Yoongi sleep more, but it wasn’t something he could really control beyond making sure Yoongi didn’t stay in the studio all night. At the very least, Yoongi seemed to sleep better when Jungkook was there next to him, so he made it a habit to sneak into the elder’s bed.


In a short two weeks, Yoongi had begun to fill his skin a little better than before. For the most part, it comforted Jungkook to know that his boyfriend was no longer just bone. Jungkook would never understand Yoongi’s complete lack of self-preservation. It was this thought that kept him up at night while Yoongi slept next to him, calmed by the fingers running through his hair gently.


“I love you.” Jungkook whispered.


It was a confession he had not yet spoken before. In all of the three-hundred and some days that had passed, he had never uttered it. Countless times he had said that he liked him, or even really  liked him, but ‘love’ never passed his lips. It had never passed Yoongi’s lips either, but Jungkook knew all along that he’d be the first to say it.


Yoongi stirred in his sleep, but otherwise showed no sign of being awake to hear what Jungkook had said. Jungkook sighed in relief knowing that. Even now, he was afraid. He was afraid that Yoongi didn’t like him, no matter how much the rapper said otherwise.


“-kook?” Yoongi whimpered, barely awake. “Jungkook?”


“Yeah?”


“I... love you too. Now go to sleep, hmm?”


“You weren’t supposed to hear that.”


“No? But it was for me.” Yoongi replied groggily.


Yoongi allowed himself to pull Jungkook closer, snuggling into his warmth. He was too tired for shame. Jungkook relented, wrapping his arms tighter around the smaller man. These days, he was sneaking out of this bed as often as he would sneak in it, forced to deal with certain problems that arose before the elder awoke and noticed. Because of that, he didn’t often hold him so closely, for fear that he wouldn’t be able to untangle himself in the morning.


Both of them were prancing around each other. Both of them were wanting it, but neither of them were brave enough to start it. The one time Jungkook had, it wasn’t the right time. He was too afraid that the next time he tried would be the same. Yoongi on the other hand, was just too afraid to try.


That didn’t stop his hands from wandering. Pretending as if the movements were aimless, his fingers would often travel across Jungkook’s skin, leaving burning trails. Sometimes, they would travel to dangerous places, lingering on the smooth skin of Jungkook’s hips, pressing down on the inside of his thigh.


They were teasing touches that weren’t always meant to be teasing. They existed before that night two weeks ago, but became more frequent after. Tonight was no exception, Yoongi’s nimble fingers gliding across the small curve of Jungkook’s back. His touches traveled slowly upwards, feeling the bumps of the singer’s spine. Jungkook had to struggle not to curve away from the touch, forcing himself to keep his breathing steady, refusing to let Yoongi know that such a simple touch was affecting him.


Those wicked fingers curved, nails digging lightly in his skin, pink marks lining his back as Yoongi’s hands traveled back down. Yoongi knew it drove him crazy. He could hear it in the shuddering of his breath. He could feel it in the goosebumps that rose on his arms. Jungkook didn’t have to say anything, because Yoongi knew... but Yoongi would pretend otherwise. He’d pretend that it was mindless, his fingers moving on their own.


Jungkook wondered how he made it through another night.

“Three hundred fifteen.” Jungkook muttered.


“What was that?”


“Three hundred and fifteen.” He repeated with a sigh, looking at Yoongi through the corner of his eye. Yoongi wasn’t really paying attention, eyes glued to his computer screen as he tweaked the track he was working on.


“Three hundred fifteen, what?”


“Days.”


“Until?”


“Not until. Since.”


“Since what?”


“Since we started dating. It’s been three hundred and fifteen days since July twenty-sixth. Almost a year.” He huffed. Yoongi finally glanced at him, giving him a curious look.


“You sound bitter.”


“Hyung, it’s been almost a year and...”


“And...?”


“Never mind.” Jungkook gave up, crossing his arms and glaring at the wall. Yoongi quickly saved his work before turning around in his chair to face the maknae.


“You’re doing that again.” He mumbled, noting that this wasn’t the first time Jungkook had acted like this.


“Doing what?”


“Clearly you’re having a problem with something, but even when I try to ask about it, you just mope and give up on the conversation. I can’t read minds, so if you want me to do something that I’m not doing, this isn’t the way to go about it.” Yoongi scolded.


Truthfully, Yoongi was no better, and he knew that. Yoongi refused to ask for the things he wanted. He wasn’t confident enough to do so, and some of the things he wanted were too embarrassing to even consider mentioning to the younger. Still, at least he didn’t pout about it in front of the other.


“I just... I don’t know. It’s been this long and we’ve never done more than kiss.”


“So that’s why you’re sulking.”


Yoongi let out a sigh before leaving his chair, moving to sit next to Jungkook on the couch. He’d be lying if he tried to say that he wasn’t frustrated with it too, but he knew he was mostly to blame. Yet, he still wouldn’t do anything. Whenever he wanted to move things forward, he ended up thinking too much about it and convincing himself it wasn’t a good idea.


Jungkook was still looking away from Yoongi, sticking his lower lip out in an exaggerated pout. The rapper rested his hand on Jungkook’s thigh, absentmindedly running his fingers along the inner seam of his jeans. Jungkook held his pout, refusing to let him win. Once again, Yoongi got an idea, and once again he decided to ignore it. Yet, as minutes passed with Jungkook sticking out his lip and Yoongi just staring at him, he finally built up the courage to move.


He leant forward, capturing Jungkook’s lip between his teeth lightly and catching him by surprise. Jungkook’s arms wrapped around his shoulders almost as a reflex, holding him closer. Yoongi’s legs swung over so he was straddling the maknae, his hand running through Jungkook’s black hair. Jungkook let out a sigh as they parted again.


“You know, some couples go a year without even kissing. A lot of couples date for a long time before they-”


“Some couples start with sex.” Jungkook stated unabashedly. The mere statement made Yoongi blush. “You drive me fucking crazy. God, if you could see yourself through my eyes…”


“Do I really?” Yoongi chuckled lowly, leaning down and brushing his lips against Jungkook’s jaw. He hoped he sounded more confident than he felt.


“Fucking hell.” Jungkook groaned, his head falling back and hitting the wall. He squeezed Yoongi’s hips, praying he had the self-restraint he needed. “Yes, you do. Especially right now.”


“So do something about it.”


“I can’t. Not here.” Jungkook swallowed. As much as he would like to, he was not going to let his first time with his boyfriend be in the studio. Not the first time.


With a huff, Jungkook shoved the rapper off of him, grabbing his wrist and dragging them both home. Right now, he didn’t care if someone was home. Right now, he didn’t care if someone would hear them or walk in. Right now, all he cared about was that Yoongi had all but given him permission and he wasn’t letting this chance walk away again.


As soon as they got into the elder’s room, he was shoved against the door roughly. Hands tugged at his sweatshirt and lips pressed together in a frenzy. Yoongi let out a chuckle, seeing how desperate the singer was. His hands moved a lot slower, pressing against the other’s abdomen and sliding up his torso. His hands were forced to move as Jungkook yanked off his jacket and rapidly grabbed at his t-shirt.


“Slow down.” Yoongi laughed breathlessly. “I’m not going anywhere.”


With a smile, Jungkook slowed his movements, his thumbs massaging the blonde’s hips as he kissed his neck. Yoongi rested his arms on Jungkook’s shoulders, humming happily when he pressed closer. Large hands cupped the rapper’s ass, pulling him against Jungkook and kneading the flesh. Those same hands moved down, resting on Yoongi’s thighs and lifting him up.


Yoongi held on tighter as he wrapped his legs around the maknae’s waist. Jungkook scraped his teeth along his collar, weighing the pros and cons of sucking a hickey into the elder’s skin. He thought better of it, knowing there were better places to leave his marks. Yoongi shuddered, still not quite willing to admit how much he wanted this.


His mind still allowed those sneaking thoughts that this was wrong somehow. He kept telling himself that he shouldn’t want this, that Jungkook was still too young, that there were too many reasons why this was wrong… but it wasn’t. He knew that. He wanted this, Jungkook wanted this, and he wasn’t planning on letting those thoughts change things.


“I’m not going anywhere.” He repeated, more for himself than Jungkook.


Jungkook took them over to the bed, dropping Yoongi on the mattress and pulling off his shirt before climbing over him. Yoongi’s hands attached themselves to his sides, feeling the smooth skin and the muscles moving underneath as Jungkook started pulling off Yoongi’s tee as well. Kisses trailed from his neck to his collarbone to his chest before the shirt was removed and tossed away.


Long fingers brushed through Jungkook’s hair as he continued to move downward, sucking marks into the rapper’s torso. He wasn’t concerned about other people seeing, since Yoongi never walked around shirtless. He shivered when Yoongi tugged at his hair, pulling him back up for a kiss.


As he fumbled with his button and zipper, he cursed that Yoongi decided to wear skinny jeans. They were too much of a pain to take off for his liking, and it wasn’t fair. The elder just laughed at him before easily sliding Jungkook’s sweatpants down his legs. Yoongi took the opportunity to flip their positions, pushing Jungkook to lean back and straddling him.


He palmed the singer lightly through his boxers as he nibbled on his earlobe. He felt like he knew exactly which buttons to push to get Jungkook to writhe. Jungkook held his hips, nails digging in almost harshly while Yoongi chuckled lowly in his ear. His free hand trailed down his side lightly, tracing the curves of his muscles. Jungkook sucked in a sharp breath as Yoongi’s fingers slipped into his boxers, teasing him.


He wondered what it would take to unravel the elder. He wondered if it would be much effort to hear a hitch in his breath, to feel his hands falter. He tested it, his own hands sliding around to the back of his thighs, kneading and moving slowly to his ass. Their lips came together again and he focused on removing Yoongi’s briefs as smoothly as possible. Jungkook rolled them over once that last piece of clothing landed on the floor.


He groaned as they pulled apart, grabbing Yoongi’s hands and pinning them above his head, ending his teasing so he could pay it back. His lips closed around a nipple, flicking it with his tongue and enjoying the way Yoongi’s back arched just that slightest bit. Gripping both of his hyung’s wrists with one hand, he used the free hand to pinch the other side, rolling it between his fingertips. He could hear Yoongi swallow down a moan, but that wasn’t good enough.


He sucked on the other nub as his hand moved south, tickling Yoongi’s side and spreading his legs so that he could fit properly between them. His hand shook as his fingers lightly trailed over the blonde’s erection. As soon as Jungkook let go of his wrists, Yoongi’s hands curled into his hair, tugging as Jungkook trailed further downward, nipping at his stomach, his hips, the inside of his thighs.


Yoongi let out a long whine and covered his eyes when he saw Jungkook pull away and sit up straight. He looked beautiful. Flushed cheeks, heaving breaths, pale skin marked with forming bruises. Mussed hair and spread, trembling legs and Jungkook was impossibly happy that he was the only one to see him like this. He leant over and reached under the bed, pawing for the plastic bag he had stashed there over a month ago for exactly this moment. Yoongi looked at him incredulously when he straightened back up.


“What- When- I didn’t put that there.” He stammered and Jungkook couldn’t help but laugh.


“No, I did. I figured I sleep in here more often and it’s easier to kick Jin out of this room than Tae and Hope out of my room so…”


“How long has that… I don’t want to know, oh my god.”


“At least I’m prepared?” Jungkook chuckled, pulling Yoongi’s hands away from his face and pressing their lips together.


He quickly slipped off his boxers before continuing, sliding back down to tease Yoongi’s member while he slicked his fingers with lube. He licked a stripe up to the head as he began to toy with the rapper’s entrance, prodding and rubbing without actually entering him. Yoongi chewed on the back of his hand when Jungkook finally pushed a finger inside. He hoped it would help muffle him.


He had been blown before, and he had been fingered before, but never at the same time. He wasn’t sure how well he could handle it. His other hand pulled harshly at the strands of black hair tickling his abdomen. His toes curled as the singer slipped in another finger slowly, matching the pace of his mouth. Jungkook enjoyed the little mewls that he tried to hide. He enjoyed that he was causing them.


Yoongi was a wreck, and it was his fault, and he loved it.


Yoongi pulled Jungkook back up as he slid in a third finger, absolutely certain he wouldn’t last if Jungkook continued as he was. He was already shaking, strung tight, and impatient. He wasn’t sure if he just wanted it to end already or if he never wanted to stop. Jungkook’s lips melded with his own perfectly, and he could feel him smirking, proud at how he was able to ruin his hyung’s composure.


“I love you.” Jungkook murmured against Yoongi’s shoulder as he removed his fingers.


“I love you too.”


Jungkook moved slowly, letting out his held breath and nipping at his boyfriend’s jaw once he had pushed fully inside. His hands slid up and down Yoongi’s sides, like he was trying to comfort him. Yoongi shuddered, pulling Jungkook impossibly closer and wrapping his legs around the taller boy’s waist.


Jungkook started moving, keeping pace in his head almost as if he were dancing. Yoongi’s moans and whimpers were his favorite music. The rappers hands moved erratically, grasping the sheets, pillows, Jungkook, indecisive on what to hold. Jungkook was still moving slowly and Yoongi didn’t know what to do with himself.


He settled on grabbing the maknae’s hair, mashing their lips together in a futile hope to muffle himself. He was almost certain he might be hurting Jungkook with how tight his grip was on his hair, but at that moment it was the only thing grounding him. He took shuddering breaths as Jungkook sped up. His nails dug into the singer’s shoulders, dragging down and leaving angry, rough lines almost as if it were his intention. (It wasn’t.)


Jungkook choked at the searing feeling of Yoongi clawing him, but he wasn’t planning on making him stop. He paid back the favor, his fingers gripping Yoongi’s hips so tightly it was sure to bruise, leaving a lasting impression of his hands.


Yoongi’s moan as he unraveled was obscene, and Jungkook wanted a recording of it. It was breathy and gritty and music to his ears. He wondered if Yoongi thought the same about the sounds Jungkook made.


He hissed as he rolled over onto his back, arching away from the sting. A flash of concern passed over the rapper as he hurriedly pulled Jungkook to sit up. His embarrassed blush was more than worth the persistent throbbing, and he chuckled as Yoongi muttered out apologies, gawking at his own fingers and possibly wondering if his nails might be too long.


“I think you made me bleed, hyung.” Jungkook pestered cheekily, not too concerned as he pulled Yoongi to rest on his lap.


“I- I didn’t think I… I mean… I’m sorry.”


Jungkook hummed in response, laying them both down as a wave of sleepiness passed over him, the exhaustion of the day and their activities catching up to him. Yoongi only protested slightly, complaining about being sticky and naked and eventually, he gave up when he realized that Jungkook wasn’t listening. Jungkook didn’t care, and Jungkook wasn’t going to release him. After a while, he figured that maybe they could just shower in the morning.


Initially, he was surprised to find the dorm empty when they woke up. He figured it out quickly after finding Jin’s not-so-subtle message, in the form of a first aid kit and a post-it note with a thumbs up. He prayed that the blanket was covering them when he had come in, and that Jungkook’s back was the only thing he saw.


From that point on, Jungkook wasn’t the only one to tease him by calling him ‘kitty’. All because of a few rough lines.
