Special Note



Okay. Wow. 200 kudos and 2500+ hits! Thank you all so much, I’ve never had this much hits before. I’m thinking of doing a special group chat chapter. Okay, so what I’m thinking of doing is:Send me some characters. OCs, canon DBH characters not already in the chat, whatever! Tell me about them and if they’re OCs, tell me what you’d like their group chat name to be. The characters are just going to have one chapter to talk, argue, and just do whatever! Thanks for all these hits and kudos. ^^
