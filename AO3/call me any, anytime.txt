Summary
isak (11:17)hi vilde i said i’d text u so this is my new numberthis is isak btwalso before i forget u owe me a coffee – kb after school tomorrow?say hi to eva for mevilde (12:04)so I guess I should tell you this isn’t Vilde’s number?I’m still down for coffee though
Notes
yet another wrong number au texting fic. this was a lot of fun to write so hopefully it's fun for you to read as well! title is from blondie's "call me" even though like... one phone call is made in this entire ficwarnings for discussions and portrayal of mental illness, ableist language, religious content, sonja being sonja (she means no harm but ya know), and lots of boys being sad. there is a happy ending though, promise! this is basically an au where even doesn't transfer to nissen but still repeats his third year, isak and vilde are good friends and vilde is the only person who knows isak is gay. which is kind of why they're good friends. everything else is pretty much the same, except maybe this isak has yellow curtains on his window :)before anyone asks, no, i do not have a mental illness. i have however lived my whole life with someone who has bipolar disorder so am very familiar with it. but if anything in this fic is inaccurate/offensive, please lmk asap so i can correct my mistake! and finally, this fic is for marnie. sorry i missed seeing you today. have fun at the mardi gras my love <3(also i suck at html so idk how to code emojis here. you'll just have to suffer through [eggplant emoji] in silence)

          See the end of the work for more notes

Do not assume that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. A man’s enemies will be the members of his own household. Anyone who loves his father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; anyone who loves his son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me; and anyone who does not take up his cross and follow Me is not worthy of Me. *

even (11:42)
because he’s a storyteller. because he doesn’t worry about what other people think of him. because he’s not afraid to take risks with his films, or make them weird, or funny, or do something different with them that’s never been attempted before. because his films are an escape when I need it. and I need it a lot, sometimes 
isak (11:43)

The noise of my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator, vagabond,
I gallivant around the equator
And that would get me off the radarIt’s so intense, I’m on my Lilo and Stitch
Pour my Pino Grigio with some lime what is this?
An immaculate version of me and my baby
With all respect cause you the only one that gets me

For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. It teaches us to say “No” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age, while we wait for the blessed hope—the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good. *

 incoming call – isak (10:13) 
“Hi, Even. Um. This is Isak. I know you’ve been getting my texts because your read receipts are on but—but if you don’t wanna talk, that’s okay. So um. Maybe if you just listen for a bit?I’m really worried about you. I know we don’t really know each other because we’ve never even met but—but I feel like I’ve known you forever. I’ve told you things pretty much no-one else knows because I trust you, Even. I trust you and I miss you.So um. If this—if you not talking to me has something to do with what I said before, about my mamma, I’m sorry. I’m—I’m not good at stuff like this Even. But—I want to try. I want to try with her again, and I’d like to try with you. If you’d let me.Anyway. Sorry for leaving such a long voicemail. It’s okay if you didn’t listen all the way to the end. And—it’s okay if you don’t call me back. That’s okay. Just—just know that I’m here, and you’re not alone. You’re never alone, Even.”

Hi Isak, this is Even’s girlfriend Sonja. Please stop trying to contact him. You’re only making him more upset.

even (10:35)
Even has bipolar disorder. He was manic and now he’s depressed.

The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. 
isak (13:45)

Afterword


End Notes
isak is more perceptive of even's mental illness in this fic than he is in the show bc that's just how the fic turned out. hopefully i made it kind of obvious so isak making the connection between even's silence and his mother isn't too much of a leap
