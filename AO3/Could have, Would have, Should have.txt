This chapter takes place two weeks after the final judgement, but assumes that Prince Jing never found out Mei Changsu's identity as Lin Shu.  Chinese translation by jiakalanda

"Why does it have to end like this?"Rage lined every edge of Prince Jing's face as he turned to face the prisoner in cell 334. Mei Changsu's expression was one of tranquility and acceptance. The fur-lined cloak draped around his slender body was deceivingly clean, a brilliant white in the gloomy setting."What was His Highness expecting?" asked Mei Changsu.The question caught Prince Jing off-guard. He'd opened his mouth to exclaim something, but rapidly closed it, biting back words that were inevitably based on righteousness and no logic. There was a kind of feverish desperation in Prince Jing's voice as he spat out, "You said you were on my side.""I've yet to lift a single finger against you," said Mei Changsu. An eerie exhaustion seemed to have seeped into the man's already sickly voice. His eyes finally opened as Prince Jing stormed closer, infinitely calm against the turmoil and animosity in Prince Jing's eyes."You poisoned my Father!" said Prince Jing. "He lies in a comatosed state, doomed to spend the rest of his life in nightmares and ... ""I've only plotted up to the reversal of the Meiling case," murmured Mei Changsu. The case was opened and overturned exactly two weeks ago, but Emperor Liang had rampaged like a rabid dog with the little power he had left. "Beyond that... the new scheme your father almost successfully employed... was entirely out of my control.""All the obstacles in your path must be removed, right?" Prince Jing bit out icily. "Enemies, corrupted officials, rivals - friends, families, morals.""Ideally, Your Highness," said Mei Changsu. He regarded the crowned prince coolly. Despite how he was kneeling on the bed of straw, he had the poise of an emperor commanding a victory."You dare poison the emperor when harming a hair on his head results in the execution of nine generation!""That is right," said Mei Changsu. He nodded in acceptance as a faraway look entered his eyes. "My friends, my family, my relatives, my faithful followers..." A smirk. "What's left of them anyway.""I acknowledge your assistance," said Prince Jing. He waved his hand stiffly and a prison guard walked forward, bearing a cup of poisoned wine. "I will not prosecute your friends and acquaintances, but you must be punished for your crimes against my royal father.""I have thanked Your Highness," said Mei Changsu. He bowed deeply from his position on the ground, but did not make any attempt to stand. At the rate his body was deteriorating, standing might have been impossible.Prince Jing nodded at the guard and the goblet of wine was placed on the small table in front of where Mei Changsu knelt. As the guard left, Prince Jing lowered himself until he was leveled with the prisoner and murmured, "No one needs to be looking when you drink that wine. I can command the guards away with me."A cheerful smile crossed Mei Changsu's face, bringing a lively light into his eyes. "Your Highness, I poisoned your father, forced your brother to commit suicide and drove your other brother insane."Prince Jing scowled, his face reflecting the inner turmoil that clawed his heart and howled in his mind. He was torn between knowing and doing what was right, yet was unable to accept that such actions could possibly be right. Mei Changsu watched as a tear silently slid down Prince Jing's cheeks and the prince hastily wiped it away, surprised by its presence."Are you...?" said Prince Jing. "Or have you ever felt... sorry?""Yes," said Mei Changsu. He smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. "But never sorry enough. All the obstacles in our path must be removed.""Well, you can rest in peace," Prince Jing bit out bitterly. He pushed himself up and dusted away the few specks of dirt that'd landed on his robes. His hands fell to clasp behind his back as the crowned prince turned to walk out of the cell. "I will ascend the throne tomorrow. Right now, I will command the guards away and...""All the obstacles in our path must be removed," said Mei Changsu. His voice was stronger and there was a indecipherable smile on his lips. His eyes reflected the dancing shadows and flickering candlelight as Mei Changsu lifted his eyes to Prince Jing's halted retreat.Prince Jing turned again to stare at him, unsure of what was going to happen."And there is one last obstacle," said Mei Changsu.Despite the lightning fast speed that Prince Jing reached out with, Mei Changsu had already poured the wine down his throat. The man's gaze wavered for a second as Prince Jing shook him and hissed, "Spit it out!"There was an intense struggle as Prince Jing tried to yell for help and Mei Changsu immediately clamped a hand over Prince Jing's mouth with strength and ferocity he hadn't expected himself to possess. After the prince calmed down, the strategist dropped his hand and sent him a warning glare."For what it is worth, this is the second best ending," said Mei Changsu. "I failed to predict that the emperor had one last card up his sleeve."There was a million things that Prince Jing wanted to say, but none of it made it to his mouth other than, "What was the first?""An impossible dream," said Mei Changsu. He lifted a hand to push away the clothes on his left wrist, fingers circling the now bare area. Prince Jing's eyes followed the movement, noting the extremely pale circle of skin that indicated the lengthy residence of a wristband. Quickly, the man caught Prince Jing's sleeve, "I've never done anything to you that I need to be sorry for, but I am sorry for forcing you to walk down this path. If I had any other choice I would not have chosen you.""Why?" asked Prince Jing.The prince seemed to be aware that the man in front of him was someone who would do anything for him but was unable to understand it. A desperate plea entered his voice as he thought of a better question. "Who are you?""A deceitful, ruthless strategist who cannot stand besides you as you ascend the throne," said Mei Changsu. "Lest people think that you are a tyrant blinded by power and lies. What do you think the people will think if they don't see the dead body of the man who poisoned the emperor?""Let them think what they want!" said Prince Jing. "There are so many things you won't tell me, but I know one thing. I know you are on my side. You made me.""As the emperor, you must care about what your people think. You must be at one with their voice, their aspirations and their dreams in order to repair decades' worth of rot and waste." said Mei Changsu. "You must become the country's savior as well as the people's hero.""I can do it," said Prince Jing. His back subtlety straightened with confidence."I know," said Mei Changsu. He murmured privately to himself, "Though a stubborn, water loving silly water ox ..."He stopped to cough, glancing at the impossible amount of blood stained his sleeve when he pulled his hand away. His body burned with the poison and Mei Changsu could feel his strength slipping away until he could no longer support his own weight.Prince Jing caught his fall, asking "What did you say?"There was a moment of silence as Mei Changsu looked around one last time. He suddenly felt a sense of lightness, as if he'd finally shed a thousand pounds. Everything else was blurry but he could see Prince Jing's frantic eyes searching his face. Prince Jing was calling for help, but fell silent as soon as Mei Changsu attempted to speak."Jingyan." There was the gentlest smile on Mei Changsu's face as his eyes fell close. "Don't be afraid."

No one spoke a single word on the journey back.Mengzhi counted that Xiao Shu glanced at Prince Jing at least sixteen times. After that, he lost count, but he thought he might have missed a number anyway. As for Prince Jing, he didn't look at Xiao Shu once. The prince sent men to inform Nihuang and Zhan Ying of their safety and those were the only words he spoke to anyone.When the carriage finally arrived at the Su residence and Xiao Shu stepped down, Prince Jing broke the silence, " Zhu Fangzhi, a magistrate in the Henan province has been a man of honorable conduct and outstanding service. I wish to recommend him for the position of regional governor."Mengzhi spent a few seconds running the words through his mind before he dismissed it as civic affairs that didn't require his militaristic expertise. Xiao Shu didn't seem any more interested in the topic than he was. The man glanced at Prince Jing dubiously and said a single word: "Oh.""My men have been closely monitoring the current regional governor. I cannot confirm if he truly take bribes, but I found him to be a greedy, sloppy person. I have also heard stories about the arrogance of the military commander, so I hope that Fangzhi will be able to -" Prince Jing broke off, finally aware that the expression on Xiao Shu's face was even more impassive than the one on Mengzhi's face.Prince Jing huffed, "Mr. Su, are you listening to me?"Here, Mengzhi blinked in confusion, ready to interrupt the conversation. True, he was easily baffled, but he was sure Prince Jing knew of Xiao Shu's identity by now. So why wasn't Jingyan smiling and hugging his best friend? Mengzhi would have laughed and hugged his best friend if they were separated for thirteen years. Before he could talk, Xiao Shu shot him a warning look and Mengzhi clamped his lips shut."Jingyan, do you not have anything to say to me?" asked Xiao Shu."Have I not been trying to talk to you in the last five minutes?" Prince Jing scowled. Prince Jing took a deep breath, his chin lifting to the side. "I understand if your health does not allow you to focus today, Mr. Su. In that case, I will take my leave."Mengzhi scratched his head. Had it really been five minutes?"Jingyan," said Xiao Shu."Is that the appropriate way to address your liege, Mr. Su? Your manners had been impeccable up until now. What happened?" Prince Jing said harshly.This made Mengzhi angry.The indignation of the event reached out to him, frustrating the bulky man. He stepped up, his hand naturally falling to his sword even though he would never pull it against Xiao Shu or Prince Jing. Prince Jing had no rights to speak to Lin Shu like that, even if he wasn't aware of who Mei Changsu was.The icy glare Xiao Shu directed at him could have froze a charging tiger.Fine, Mingzhe thought, stepping back."Jingyan, are you angry at me?" asked Xiao Shu."No, why would I be angry at you? Your insights have helped me greatly during today's court gathering, Mr. Su."Mei Changsu closed his eyes, his lips thinning. The small reserve of patience he had for Jingyan's antics was rapidly vanishing. "I know you are a man who cherish friendship and sentiment, Jingyan, but there is a bigger picture that you must see--""This conversation is coming out of nowhere," interrupted Jingyan. He smoothed an nonexistent wrinkle in his ceremonial robes and fixed the piece of jade decoration hanging from his belt. Then, he started straightening out his sleeve. "Why don't we return to more pressing matters, like Henan's position reassignment?""Xiao Jingyan, let me finish speaking!" snapped Xiao Shu. He'd returned to glaring at Prince Jing, a small grimace beginning to form. "There is a bigger picture--"Prince Jing interrupted him again, "The biggest picture in the city is in my Royal Father's study room. Does Mr. Su wish to see it?"Mengzhi was definitely confused by now. He kept his lips sealed and hands clasped behind him to prevent himself from drawing his sword or advancing to the bickering friends. He could not comprehend what was going on and the conversation did not make sense, but he knew Xiao Shu did not want him to interfere and a military man was best at following orders."Xiao Jingyan! Just because your nickname is water ox does not mean you have to possess the intelligence of one," shouted Xiao Shu. His voice echoed in the relatively empty street and carried through the doors of the Su residence, causing Fei Liu to fly foward. The young boy landed next to Mengzhi, who quickly gripped his arm to prevent him from attacking anyone."If a high intelligence is used to deceive friends and exploit people, I can do without," said Prince Jing."I am sure you are already familiar with the condition," Xiao Shu answered without missing a beat.The two glowered at each other, neither yielding.Fei Liu looked at Mengzhi, wondering why the general was restraining him from beating up the man bullying his beloved brother. Recalling a fancy term he learned a few days ago that seemed to describe the current affairs, Mengzhi proudly opened his mouth to explain the situation to a restless Fei Liu: "Lovers' quarrel."Two pairs of infuriated eyes immediately snapped to him.Oh.He'd said the wrong thing again, hadn't he?Fei Liu swiveled his head, looking from Xiao Shu to Prince Jing to him. Then, the boy's eyes wandered to a fruit hanging from a nearby tree."I just remembered an urgent military situation of paramount importance that demands my immediate attention," Mengzhi stammered, rapidly backing away. He yanked a protesting Fei Liu away with him, mentally praising himself for his quick reaction to the situation. The next time Little Prince Mu taught him a term, he better made sure he knew exactly what it meant.After Mengzhi left with Fei Liu, Lin Shu parted his lips to speak again. His eyes drilled into Jingyan's, daring the other to interrupt him just one more time. Without missing a beat, he declared viciously, "Seventy thousand lives have perished with undeserved guilt, cruelly betrayed by something they would give their life to defend! You matter to me and you have always mattered to me, but I cannot weight our friendship over the lives of my seventy thousand men, my entire family and the condemnation of your innocent brother!""Because that's the kind of person I am, right, Mr. Su? Someone who wouldn't support your goals, someone who doesn't want this justice as much as you do," said Prince Jing. His voice was rising uncontrollably and his eyes flashed with unshed tears. "Heaven forbids I want justice for the condemned! Prince Qi was my dearest brother and you," Jingyan broke off, then corrected himself "and Xiao Shu was my best friend!"He refused to acknowledge the man in front of him as Xiao Shu. Xiao Shu was his best friend, someone who respected him. Xiao Shu was not someone who would use him like a pawn, who would use other people like chess pieces. Xiao Shu was not someone who would go through all lengths to deceive him and tell everyone else to deceive him. Xiao Shu was not someone who wouldn't let Jingyan share his burdens and fight his battles with him. They were friends, playmates brothers, partner-in-crimes; They were everything."That is not the point!" said Mei Changsu."Of course not," said Jingyan. His voice was chilly and his words dripped with hostility and bitterness. "The point is, I would have gotten in your way.""No," Mei Changsu said before he could stop himself. He sighed helplessly. "Well, that was a possibility that I did not wish to gamble on. You must understand, the task was daunting and nearly impossible. I did not want to make bets on whether you can keep your emotion in check."Despite everything, Jingyan flushed. He'd failed horribly that one time in the snowstorm. But that wasn't entirely his fault, was it? If he'd known it was Lin Shu telling him to trust him and wait, he would have done just that. At that time, it felt like picking between his devious strategist and his single link to the events thirteen years ago, to Lin Shu.How was Jingyan suppose to pick Mei Changsu over Lin Shu?"That was why did you not tell me who you were?" asked Jingyan. Miserably, he added, "Everyone knew, except me. I must've been one hell of a liability."Mei Changsu sighed again, this time in exasperation. He lifted a hand to his temple. Was that the reason why Jingyan had worked himself into such rage? Because he didn't tell him he was alive and back? He swallowed the small smile before it could reach his lips. With his anger spent, Jingyan was definitely sulking now and dare he say the crowned prince was pouting?"I did not tell anyone since I set foot in the city," said Mei Changsu. He spoke evenly, stating the simple facts. "Everyone who knew figured it out themselves. How is it my fault that you did not figure it out?"Jingyan halted his movements, suspicion wavering his temper, "...Even my mother?""She figured it out after reading my travel journal," said Mei Changsu.A smile broke past his restraints when Jingyan looked away, suddenly finding a spot on the wall very interesting. Based on the condition of his returned journal, Jingyan must've very thoroughly examined the book and he hadn't found anything amiss. Jingyan stood stiffly, his hands clasped behind his back. There was a confused frown on his face as he finally began to reflect on his anger and accusations."It's still wrong," Jingyan said stubbornly."Everything about this has been wrong since the beginning," Lin Shu said gently. "But that is why I am here. To make it right."There was a minute of silence as Jingyan finally met his eyes. Lin Shu regarded him serenely, trying to convey everything from his sincerity to his conviction through his eyes. Finally, Jingyan smiled and looked away."I am doing this with you, Xiao Shu."

(( "Xiao Shu, what was the urgent military situation that Mengzhi spoke of? If the there is unease at the border, I must become aware of the situation immediately..." ))Zhu Fangzhi is made up, and while Henan was part of the Jin Dynasty, I do not know if the region was part of Liang Dynasty.

They sat in pavilion under the opal moon and starless sky, a man huddling under a thick fur cloak and a boy in a thin white shirt. Like a dream, hundreds of fireflies danced around them, weaving between and behind a blur of flowers in full bloom. The boy broke the silence.“It’s just that, Nihuang,” said Lin Shu. He twisted a corner of his sleeve, his fingers twiddling around with the fabric.“Nihuang,” said the man. A trace of disbelief made it through his normally stoic features.“Yeah, I have an obligation to Nihuang,” said Lin Shu. He smiled proudly. “You know that, Mei Changsu. We were supposed to get married. I promised mother to have at least three kids. She wanted three boys but Nihuang wanted a girl too. Great grandmother was so proud of us, too – a perfect affiliation, whether personal or political.”“Even now you need to lie to yourself,” said Mei Changsu. He sounded weary; if he had the ability to choose whether he wanted to be here or not, he would have chose not. He glanced at the jade cup on the low table between them, then reached out for it, long fingers idly playing with the carved embellishment.Lin Shu sat up straighter, and glared at him. “Don’t go there.”“She is enough to give you an illusion,” said Mei Changsu. He lifted his teacup to blow gently on his tea. The floral scent wafted up, vapor blurring his sight for a moment. “Beautiful enough tempt you, smart enough to engage you, gallant enough to understand you. What does it matter that she—““Don’t go there!” Lin Shu nearly shouted. He lurched forward, as if he wanted to grab the collar of Mei Changsu’s robes. He stopped in time and pressed his palm on the table instead.“You can attack me if you want, Lin Shu, but you still need to let go of that thing,” said Mei Changsu. He set the teacup down after he took a sip.“Not a thing,” said Lin Shu. He was beginning to sulk.“Thing,” said Mei Changsu. “He may or may not be a thing, but your feelings, to me, is a thing.”“That you want gone,” whispered Lin Shu.“Not necessarily,” said Mei Changsu. “It is the best course of action, but I fear, if I insist on its destruction, you might reject everything altogether. But if this plan is to come together, you can not hold on to Prince Jing like this.”“Why?” asked Lin Shu. “I’ve agreed to everything else already. It was my name that provided you with the connections you needs, my intelligence with which you formed your schemes, my conscience you will be bloodying. ”“And if you can not release Prince Jing so I can move him to the center of our chessboard, all your sacrifice would have been in vain.” Mei Changsu spoke plainly, without any hesitation or regret. “It’s just that, Jingyan… He hates politics. He’d hate to be emperor,” said Lin Shu. His voice was becoming shaky with wavering desperation, tearing with doubt and guilt. In a precise movement, his position changed so he sat hugging his knees in front of him. “He needs...”“Prince Jing has the intelligence to play politics and what it takes to be an emperor,” said Mei Changsu. He calmly regarded the boy, his eyes indecipherable and face blank. Coldly, he added, “He does not need you either.”Lin Shu started crying.Sighing, Mei Changsu rose from his seat to shuffle over to where Lin Shu sat. He wrapped his arms around him, drew him close and held his shoulder tightly. After a moment’s hesitation, Lin Shu gripped his robes and burrowed his face into it. His fists clenched the pale blue fabric tightly, creating wrinkles that Mei Changsu did not complain about.Mei Changsu said, “I suppose, you would feel better if I instead worded it, Xiao Jingyan does not need your feelings.”“Why would you care about if I felt better or worse?” said Lin Shu. His words were muffled by the fabric. “You’re just a coldblooded schemer.” He laughed, the sound choked by his tears. “I made you that way.”“I am obligated,” said Mei Changsu. He softly stroked Lin Shu’s back as the other wept into his shoulder, his movements a perfect replication of those from a comforting friend. “When you hurt, I hurt. Ultimately, that is why I can not let you hold onto Xiao Jingyan.”“I can’t let go,” said Lin Shu.“You planned to let go the moment you created me,” said Mei Changsu. “Frankly, I do not know why you hesitate now.”“If there’s something that still hurts,” whispered Lin Shu. Carelessly, he lifted Mei Changsu’s sleeve and wiped away his tears with it. When he spoke again, his voice was steadier, with a steeled edge. He smirked at Mei Changsu, “It’d remind you we’re still human.”Mei Changsu gave him a mellow smile, “Is that the point? As part of my-”Lin Shu shushed him. “We can’t afford to spare Jingyan, but I won’t relinquish my feelings for him and if that makes your job harder, too bad.”“It does not make my job harder,” Mei Changsu intoned. “It will simply destroy you faster.”“It’s alright,” said Lin Shu. The amount of life and spirit reflected through his eyes was a stark contrast to the sepulchral pair that stared back at him. He smirked lazily, cruelly, “After all, you need me gone, don’t you? Out of your way so your heart doesn’t beat faster when you see him, so you won’t feel guilt when we betray Jingrui, so you won’t be reminded that the home you'll destroy again.”“You overestimate the importance of sentiments to me,” said Mei Changsu.“Who’s lying now,” said Lin Shu.“You created me, separated me from you for the purpose of convincing yourself you are not an evil, heartless schemer,” said Mei Changsu. He drew in a slow, deep breath, one that reminded him to be patient. “So what Mei Changsu does would not reflect on Lin Shu.”“You are just a name,” Lin Shu said dully.“But you needed me to become so much more when you realized your precious Jingyan can hate Mei Changsu but still love Lin Shu.” Mei Changsu paused to straighten out the creases that Lin Shu’s hands created. His hand stilled again, clasped on his laps - Mei Changsu naturally had none of Lin Shu's quirks. “If he ever loved Lin Shu, that is. You never did have the nerves to ask how he felt.”Lin Shu bit his lips and began fiddling around with a corner of his shirt. In the ensuing silence, Mei Changsu reached out and his fingers closed around Lin Shu's so-very-tangible wrist. Lin Shu's skin was warm against his cold fingers and the echo of his nickname, Little Fire Boy, floated back to both of them. Mei Changsu shook his head, "Your obsession went so far that you even convinced yourself that we are two separate entities. Do you not see a problem?"Lin Shu's free hand fell to the top of Mei Changsu's, exploring the cool skin and bony joints. The weak scholar's hand was different from his tan, calloused one. When the poison was neutralized, every bone was shattered and mended. Every inch of skin was shed and regrew. Lin Shu smiled. The smile grew as he pushed Mei Changsu's sleeve up, exposing smooth skin that didn't have the long scar that marred Lin Shu's arm. "Then let me be insane!" Lin Shu laughed and it was utterly devoid of humor. He pried Mei Changsu's fingers off himself, yanking the cold digits away one by one. "Who would ever know? You can't betray me.""It is obvious, really," said Mei Changsu. "Prince Jing is not so dumb that he would compromise justice because he is worried about you. But that is what you want to think. Even if it would make things a hundred times easier, you do not want to use his dedication to Lin Shu to make sure he does what Mei Changsu says.""You don't understand Jingyan," said Lin Shu."You do not see the irony of your statement?" asked Mei Changsu. He spoke with a trace of pity, then lifted a corner of his robes to rub it between his thumb and forefinger. His movements were deliberate, smooth circles that seemed practiced rather than mindless. "So frightening is your obsession that you would even get jealous of yourself. The minute Prince Jing pays attention to Mei Changsu, you make sure Lin Shu comes to his mind.""That's not what everything is about."Mei Changsu regarded Lin Shu, who looked away, at the ground. Tired, Mei Changsu turned to look at the fireflies in the air, flitting around unpredictably. Some people could be fooled all the time but all people could be fooled for some time. Mei Changsu sighed, "It is about justice and responsibility.""It is," said Lin Shu. He spoke stubbornly, convinced and sure of his belief. Neither was sure who spoke the last words: "Now, sleep."
"Chieftain," said Li Gang. He gently shook Mei Changsu from his nap. "I hate to wake you up, but Prince Yu is coming by and would be here in a matter of minutes."The man sleeping on the bed shifted, then opened his eyes and Li Gang smiled down at him. Mei Changsu blinked a few times, then, as Li Gang helped him sit up, lifted a hand to his cheeks. His fingers came away wet from tears that'd fallen while he was asleep. "Nightmares?" asked Li Gang. He pulled a fur-trimmed cloak from a nearby stand to drape across Mei Changsu's shoulders. After the cloak was tied and in place, he took a wet handkerchief from a bowl of warm water nearby, twist out the excessive water and held it out."No," said Mei Changsu. A not-smile lifted the corner of his lips as he took the handkerchief from Li Gang and wiped away all traces of tears. "Just the first sign of madness."

"Lin Shu, I know it's you."Nihuang groaned as the hands over her eyes didn't immediately lift. Her brush was still suspended in midair and she was beginning to worry if ink dripped on her paper. If she had to rewrite her lengthy essay, she would personally hunt Lin Shu down and force feed him hazelnuts."How'd you know it was me?" Lin Shu skipped away from her as she swung her ink-filled brush backwards. After he was a safe distance away, Nihuang checked to make sure her essay wasn't blotched and then turned to Lin Shu.   "How would I not know it's you?" asked Nihuang. "I thought you were supposed to be practicing your swordsmanship with Jingyan.""Jingyan's in trouble," said Lin Shu. He looked smug as he took a seat on a stone dais across from her, "He stole a peach from great-grandmother's orchard."Nihuang raised an eyebrow, remembering the faint peach scent from when Lin Shu covered her eyes. "You stole a peach from great-grandmother's orchard.""Quiet!" Lin Shu hushed, as if there was anyone around the pavilion Nihuang sent everyone away to study at. Then he moved closer, "Let's go out into the city.""Why?""Because the sun is setting and it's very bad for your eyes to write in the candlelight. If you're not careful, you'll get premature wrinkles from squinting and then-"Nihuang was laughing, "Never mind. Stop talking."She looked at her unfinished paper, knowing she was several days ahead in her study anyway. Tonight was a special day in the city. "Come on, let's go."The night was as bright as day in Jinling City. The evening breeze carried with it the scent of food, flowers and herbs. The night was clear, but the air was filled with smoke from the thousands of candles that burned in and out of lanterns during Jinling's great Lantern Festival.Voices, the deeper murmur of the men and higher tones of the women, coalesced as everyone hovered over the stands that lined the Jinling's biggest street. Nihuang's stomach was full from the various morsels she'd picked off Lin Shu's purchases and she was sure she'd seen more than thousand paper lanterns.Her eyes fondly swept over all the smiles on the people's face as Lin Shu wandered off to investigated something in a stand on their right. When he returned, he held two paper lotus flowers and two pieces of paper. "Let's go write a wish and release these into the river."Nihuang blinked in surprise, taking one of the folded paper lotus flowers. The flower was slightly bigger than her hand and it was painted a realistic pink and green. The craft was expert; strong clear folds in a durable type of paper that ensured that it wouldn't immediately become waterlogged.  "I can't believe you believe in this," said Nihuang."Not really, but why not lose ourselves into the happiness of the moment?" said Lin Shu. He took her hand and began pulling her toward the direction of the river, toward a stand where dozens of brushes were being passed around as people wrote their wishes.Nihuang relented.After a minute, Nihuang carried everything over to the bank of the river, weighted her piece of paper down with a lit candle and released the lotus flower into the water. Besides her, Lin Shu did the same, and as soon as his flower touched the water he turned to ask her, "What did you write?""If we're going to do this," said Nihuang. "Then we'd better stick with the rules and not say anything about what we wrote.""But it looked as if you didn't write anything," said Lin Shu, even though Nihuang knew he knew she wasn't going to answer him.Straying from the crowds and noise, Nihuang lead Lin Shu further down the river. They were by the edge of the wood now, where pale beams of moonlight lit the ground around them and reflect from the river's surface. It was quiet enough to hear the cicadas chirp and the river rushed by like a gentle lullaby.Though it was another world from the brightly lit, inhabited city they just walked away from, there was something soothing and mesmerizing about the lonelier space. The grass was too short to sway in the breeze, but the darkened leaves danced above their heads.  Lin Shu took a seat on a large boulder facing the river and Nihuang followed to sit next to him."You know,"  Nihuang spoke as he took one of her hand in his. The paper lotus flowers drifted by on the water, each lit candle an additional bit of light in the dimness. "When you asked how I knew it was you earlier."Lin Shu's response was immediate, "Yeah?""I'll always know it's you," said Nihuang. Even if she couldn't see him or if he dressed differently.  She could remember the way he walked, the rhythm of his breath and the unique twinkle in his eyes after he made a bad joke."I think I'll know even if you look nothing like you do now."Lin Shu laughed, the sound sudden in the contemplative silence. "Why would I ever look nothing like I do now? Unless I grow too handsome, of course.""You're impossible," Nihuang rolled her eyes."And you were probably quoting a romance novel," said Lin Shu."Yuck. No, I don't read those," Nihuang pulled her hand away, slightly irritated by how dense Lin Shu was acting. Just as quickly, Lin Shu wrapped an arm around her and prevented her from moving away."I know what you mean," said Lin Shu. "You're just adorable when you're mad."Nihuang lifted an eyebrow at that, thinking about the last time she was mad. She'd fought the man who'd tried to grope her until he begged for mercy with his knees and forehead buried into a muck of mud and slime. Lin Shu's smile grew bigger and he tugged her until she rested the weight of her head on his shoulder again.They fell silent after that, lost in the steady, endless flow of the river. There was something about the movements of the river that reminded Nihuang of time passing. The paper flowers floated by, each one carrying words that represented their writer's desideratum and faith.She wondered which one carried her blank piece of paper."Sometimes, all that one wish for is right in front of them," said Nihuang. She glanced at Lin Shu. He was a silhouette against the night, but she could make out the tenderness in his eyes and the curve of his smile. "But I fear that all good things will come to an end. That one day you will leave."The candles in origami flower were lit and lively, but the light always blinked away into the night as the lotus flowers drifted further and further away. Sooner or later, the water would sink the paper flower, wash away the wishes and extinguish the flame.As Nihuang watched, another batch floated out of sight."You're so silly," said Lin Shu. He shifted so they were looking each other in the eyes.  In that moment, everything blurred together until Lin Shu was the only clear thing. Neither of them blinked as he added, "But I promise you: No matter where I go, no matter how long it'd take, I'll always make it back by your side."Nihuang smiled, "I believe you."

The ten men that surrounded him were mountain bandits of the lowest variety. They all wielded swords that were too big to be completely practical and wore unskilled combinations of hard leather and animal fur. Even a few feet away from the nearest  bandit, Jingyan could smell the peculiarly nauseating stench of bodies that hadn't washed for a while.  "He's pretty."The one who spoke, a thick man with an eye patch and two missing front teeth, appeared to be second in command. He brandished his oxtail dao and gave Jingyan an ugly (was it meant to be seductive?) leer.Jingyan's grip tightened on his sword. He'd heard about bandits who assault young men as well as women in their raids, a practice that became mostly obscure when most of the pugilist world became organized under Mei Changsu."I think he's rich too," said someone else. He heavily mustached with his tangled beard in two braids.The leader said: "Well, what are you waiting for?"There was a single exchange and before Two-Braids swung his sword again, he was skewered on the end of Jingyan's. Flawlessly balanced, Jingyan drew his blood-slick blade and the man crumbled without another breath."Shit," said the first man.The circle around him was wary now, alerted by the unexpected resistance. Jingyan raised his sword, falling into another pose as three men charged at him. They were similarly dispatched, in economical strokes that Jingyan delivered one after another."Useless creatures," said the leader.He lifted into the air in a burst of aerial energy and swung his broadsword down in a stroke that was meant to cleave Jingyan in half. Jingyan dodged, but the split-second distraction forced him into a strictly defensive position as the leader swung his large blade again and again.Six exchanges later, Jingyan made his first mistake. He lifted his sword to deflect a particularly fast thrust and largely underestimated the force behind the strike. His blade, severed from the handle, clanged uselessly on the ground beside him and there was instantly two swords at his throat."He needs to pay for the death of our brothers," said someone as his arms were twisted behind his back and he was forced to his knees."Speak, who are you and who is your family?" asked the leader. He'd stepped close enough that Jingyan could smell the rank of his breath and see that there was a mangled scar hidden underneath his heavily mustached jaw."Wouldn't you like to know?" asked Jingyan. He flinched away best he could when the leader grabbed his chin, more from the smell than the force of the action. Someone'd pulled his hair loose from his hairpiece and it fell around his face."If you don't want to answer, you can use that mouth for something else."Jingyan glared: "Try."They did. Jingyan retched when fingers tugged his head back until his throat was exposed to the night air and there was the scratch of another man's mustache against his neck. Jingyan thought he could try to bite, but the idea of voluntarily bringing himself closer was disgusting. He squeezed his eyes shut as the top clasps of his robes were slipped free.Jingyan ignored the hands rubbing his body to refocus his balance.  He could borrow the strength from the two men holding him down to kick himself free. All he needed was for the much bigger men holding him captive to be ever so slightly more distracted."You all appear busy."The new voice broke through his haze and he was suddenly freed as everyone around him suddenly sank on their knees. They all kowtowed to a pallid-looking man with loose hair and  white fur-trimmed cloak. There was a collective greeting, "Chieftain Mei."  Jingyan gathered himself together, fixing his clothes and drawing the dagger in his boots in the same move. He crouched in an attack-ready position, gaze meeting the calm eyes of the man. The other appeared statuesque in the moonlight, regal with ethereal tranquility. Jingyan murmured a greeting, "Mei Changsu, Chieftain of the Jiang Zuo Alliance and leader of the pugilist world."In essence, the leader of all the misfits that didn't listen to the Emperor of Liang and the laws of the empire."Xiao Jingyan, seventh prince of the Liang Empire and general-commander of the East borders," the other greeted just as coolly.The six bandits that'd been harassing him gasped and glanced at each other. The fact that they'd assaulted a royal prince, one with thirty thousand ironclad soldiers stationed just fifteen miles away, was bound to be a startling revelation. Their foreheads returned to press against the ground again when Mei Changsu turned his attention to them."As you've almost cost the entire Hungry Tiger Sect their lives and mountains, you can spare half of the land to the peasants of the Jingzhe village," said Mei Changsu. He walked closer as he spoke, eyes finally lifting from the top of the leader's head to turn to Jingyan, "I'm sure, in addition to heartfelt apologies, Zhongwei can also donate five hundred pounds of grain to His Highness' troops."It wasn't really a question when Mei Changsu asked,  "Is Your Highness finding the arrangements adequate?"  Mei Changsu looked like a sheep walking amongst a pack of wolves,  but as soon as he finished speaking, six pair of mouths were stumbling to apologize and kowtow to Jingyan. They kowtowed again and again, pleading for forgiveness, pleading for his troop to not invade their mountains, pleading for mercy.Eager for the air to smell like fresh grass again, Jingyan muttered, "Get out of my sight."They scrammed, only stopping to carry away the bodies of their fallen brothers.Slowly, Jingyan stood and by the time he was upright, Mei Changsu was already in front of him. In a quick move, Jingyan sheathed his dagger and regarded the man in front of him. Mei Changsu was handsome -too handsome- in an unconventional way, gaunt cheeks and pale skin adding an aura of mystery and wisdom to a man who was otherwise around Jingyan's age.As Jingyan stood there, wondering how he could end the exchange, Mei Changsu reached for him and he froze, thinking to himself: surely, Mei Changsu wouldn't try but--Mei Changsu only fastened a clasp he'd missed in his haste and his hands were hidden under his thick cloak again. The other watched his reaction with apparent amusement, "Your Highness must be traumatized.""No, I'm not," snapped Jingyan. Traumatized was for young women and virgins, neither of which Jingyan was. He picked up his hairpiece, then stored in a pocket, knowing it'd take too long to fix his hair again. "I've heard that the uncouth barbarians of the north sometimes coupled with other men, but I've always thought they were stories.""Would only uncouth barbarians couple with other men?"Mei Changsu's question triggered a what do you think look from Jingyan, who then glanced mournfully at the severed blade of his sword and turned to look for his horse. The bandits had scared it away, but his stallion would always return to him."You are not safe traveling alone and without your sword," said Mei Changsu. "Perhaps you can rest at night at my friend's house and continue in the morning.""I think I can protect myself," said Jingyan. He took two steps before a young boy flew out of thin air and somersaulted into his path. Jingyan whirled to turn to Mei Changsu, "What is the meaning of this? Are you going to hold  me here by force?""Do I need to?" Mei Changsu took him to a  house on the edge of a forest, a wooden hut with one room and the barest basic utilities of a stove, a chair, table and a bed. Sometime in the walk, his right arm began throbbing with an intensity that became hard to ignore and Jingyan gritted his teeth trying not to show he was in pain.Once inside, Jingyan collapsed onto the only chair in the hut."What's wrong with your right arm?" asked Mei Changsu."Why would you think there's something wrong?" Jingyan returned his question with a glare. It felt like his arm was on fire, burning from a cut on his bicep, a wound from a recent fight. The cut wouldn't heal and the skin around the cut was turning black."When you fought before," said Mei Changsu, "You used your left hand and only your left hand. That was why you weren't a match for Zhongwei.""Poison," Jingyan answered shortly. "An assassin that made it into my tent.""And you are travelling through these dangerous mountains alone at night because Prince Yu said he has the antidote," said Mei Changsu.Jingyan looked at him evenly, his left hand reaching up to clutch his right arm now that he no longer need to hide his injury, "How did you know?""Why aren't you more interested in why your brother schemed to take your life?" asked Mei Changsu.  "One thing at a time," Jingyan said shortly. "You're the immediate problem, not him.""Prince Yu doesn't have any antidote," said Mei Changsu. He drew out a porcelain cruet from his sleeve. "I do.""Price?" asked Jingyan. Mei Changsu wouldn't care for money, but Jingyan everything came at a price in the pugilist world.Mei Changsu said, "Come to the bed."After the predictable silence, Mei Changsu added, "I am not going to stand while I remove the poison from your arm. It takes almost an hour."Jingyan joined him on the bed, suspiciously watching as Mei Changsu pulled several rolls of bandages from under his cloak.  Jingyan said, "By military standards, the cut is minuscule. It just won't heal.""If it was any larger, the pain would be excruciating," said Mei Changsu. Jingyan's flowing sleeves were easy to roll up and Jingyan flinched when Mei Changsu began unwrapping the bandages already wrapped in place. "This type of poison always concentrate in area, so all the antidote has to do is draw it out. A slow but painless process.""To what do I owe the honor of Chieftain Mei personally treating my wounds?" asked Jingyan.Never mind that he was held here by the force of the unbeatable child bodyguard.The burning stopped as soon as Mei Changsu applied the light purple balm onto the wound. It smelled like lavender, but Jingyan suspected that the fragrance was there to disguise the actually effective medicine in the concoction. Mei Changsu wrapped a few layers of white bandages around it, then tied a loose knot. Judging by the small amount he'd poured and the amount of unused bandages, Jingyan judged that it was meant to be a repeated process."What kind of answer do you want?" asked Mei Changsu. He spoke after a lengthly pause. "Do you want to hear that I am sorry about the Hungry Tiger Sect? Maybe I am concerned about you? Or maybe out of the goodness of my heart? Or perhaps - I like you?"Jingyan flushed."Honesty would be too much to expect," said Jingyan. Then he added, "You've changed how you address me since we were alone.""Because you won't remember anything by tomorrow morning, Jingyan," said Mei Changsu."How can that happen?" Jingyan decided to humor him."Some things better remain a dream," said Mei Changsu. "Like the past. Jingyan, do you ever find yourself thinking about the past?"Jingyan gave him an odd look. "Is that something you'd like to talk about yourself?""Not in particular," said Mei Changsu."Besides, can you stop calling my name like you know me?" asked Jingyan. After a moment, he removed his shoes and sat cross-legged on the bed. "We are not friends and no matter how long you force me to stay in this house, we will not be friends.""Jingyan, why are still so obstinate?" There was an unfiltered edge of irritation in Mei Changsu's voice. Jingyan thought it was strange that Mei Changsu used still, but he dismissed the thought. "If you just open your mind a little more, you'll realize how alive this world is. How many new experiences you can expose yourself to.""I've been touched by a gang of male bandits who probably hadn't bathed for a month," said Jingyan. He watched as Mei Changu reached over to unravel the first bandage around his arm. The previously light purple of the antidote was replaced by black stain in the middle of the white gauze. Jingyan turned away, "I think that kind of nauseating proximity is enough new experiences for the night.""Was it really your first time being that close to another man?" asked Mei Changsu.  Jingyan blanched. "What. What kind of question is that?""Your body betrays you more than you think," said Mei Changsu. In a smooth movement, he was sitting so close they were almost touching and Jingyan inched away from him. "You react to my proximity. You unconsciously make assumptions about what it means when another man is close to you.""It doesn't occur to you that I may simply not like other people drawing close to me?" said Jingyan. "I am a prince - people by nature, don't touch me." He spoke to the bed curtains, turned away from Mei Changsu and the cool hands that were unraveling the bandages and reapplying the antidote."You are blushing as we speak." When the recently removed bandages fell to the ground, Jingyan saw that they too were blackened with removed poison. After a pause, Mei Changsu added, "The look suits you.""Are you trying to seduce me?" He'd blurted out the question, sharply turning around to look into Mei Changsu's eyes. There was no attempt to be graceful, just a shocking question to silence Mei Changsu.  "Would you mind?"Unable to answer because neither yes or  no would make him sound any less naive, Jingyan simply pressed his lips together and refused to speak another word as Mei Changsu changed the bandages six more times. After the last time the white gauze was wrapped around his arm and the skin around the cut was a natural red instead black, Jingyan said, "Thank you.""You're welcome," said Mei Changsu.He moved to retrieve his cloak from where he dropped it on the table. He wrapped it around himself, his intention to leave the house clear. Jingyan watched him move, the other's words floating back to him. He wouldn't remember anything by morning and that was why Mei Changsu called him by his name.He hadn't heard anyone other than his family call him by name for over twelve years.As the knot tightened over Mei Changsu's throat, Jingyan spoke."Wait," said Jingyan. He struggled to find a topic. "You saved me. Twice.""I did.""I don't... want you to just go," said Jingyan. Mei Changsu was a stranger, a dangerously powerful one, but his presence felt safe. Comfortable."What if I want to leave?"The question hurt.Jingyan looked away, fingers twisting the blanket. He had neither the right nor the means to hold Mei Changsu here. But Mei Changsu returned to his side and cool fingers tilted his face until he was looking Mei Changsu in the eyes. This close, he was as imposing as his next question, "Or what if I want what Zhongwei wanted in exchange for staying until the sun rises?"Jingyan wondered what kind of reaction or response Mei Changsu expected. He couldn't read Mei Changsu, but he felt no hostility from Mei Changsu and the man's eyes were still gentle. Jingyan said, "Do you think I'd agree?"Mei Changsu looked at him, returning the same what do you think look he'd tossed at the other's direction earlier."We'll see," said Mei Changsu.He leaned in.It was far from Jingyan's first kiss, but it was the first one where control was gently coaxed away from him and he was pliant under another's administrations. The first wave of embarrassment, apprehension and queasiness was expected, but as seconds melted into minutes, Jingyan found his resistance vanishing.It didn't stay even when he tried to hold on to it.  The hand under his chin changed to cradle the back of his neck and Mei Changsu pressed onto him until his back found the mattress of the bed. His pulse skittered, his heart fluttered, and there wasn't anything he could smell except lavender antidote and a heady scent that was purely Mei Changsu."I think," said Mei Changsu. His voice was thicker now, throatier and huskier. He caressed Jingyan's cheek with the back of his fingers and ran a thumb along his cheekbone, "If Zhongwei kissed you, I might have found myself unable to spare his life."That snapped Jingyan to his senses. His eyes widened at the position he was suddenly aware he was in - on his back, sprawled under another man pressing him down. Another man who'd made the power dynamics clear as day. He reached up, ignoring the pull on his recently cured arm, to splay his fingers against the fabric of Mei Changsu's clothes.He could push."I don't possess the same perversion as Zhongwei, the barbarians of the north or.. you," said Jingyan.  Mei Changsu's fingers stilled against his cheeks. Deliberately, he adjusted the position of Jingyan's hands until his wrists were pinned beside his head. Mei Changsu leaned in, hair spilling to tickle Jingyan's face as he mouthed his jawline. Then, in between slow, wet thrusts of his tongue, Mei Changsu murmured into his ear, "And I don't possess enough strength to lift a sword. You can push me away."When Mei Changsu kissed him again, he was merciless. Without any awareness of his own actions, Jingyan returned the kiss. He was surrendered into it, letting Mei Changsu coax his mouth open and slip his tongue in. His heart lurched and pounded furiously, each time leaving him more breathless as Mei Changsu licked, bit and nipped his lips, chin and neck.When he protested, Mei Changsu tightened his grip and kissed him harder, until he acquiesced and let Mei Changsu move as he please. Once Mei Changsu pulled back to undo the crimson sash around his torso, Jingyan asked, "Aren't you afraid I'd reverse our positions and hold you down?"It took just a few movement to reveal the white shirt Jingyan wore under his silk robes and Jingyan shivered as Mei Changu moved a hand under the thin layer of cotton. Mei Changu said,  "I don't think you'd know what to do. That makes you unwilling to try."Jingyan scowled at him, the rush of indignation spurring him to rise and easily push Mei Changsu down so he straddled the other's waist. His momentum faltered after Mei Changsu's outer robes fell open. Stalling as he tried to unclasp the layer beneath, Jingyan asked, "What's it like?"Mei Changsu held back a smile.He lift a hand and  Jingyan's lips were parted as two of Mei Changsu's fingers slipped in. The startled noised that began in the back of his throat vanished as Mei Changsu caught his eyes. He didn't dare look away as Mei Changsu pushed in deeper and deeper, until the tip of his fingers brushed against the back of his throat.Once Jingyan began to squirm in discomfort, the fingers relented. Jingyan shuddered as Mei Changsu repeated the move again and again, each time slicker, faster and more forceful than the last.By the time Mei Changsu was done, Jingyan's back was arched awkwardly and he was only held up by raw strength from years on the battlefield. He felt impossibly flushed. Weakly, he allowed himself to be maneuvered beneath Mei Changsu and the other continued to press butterfly kisses to his now bared chest.    "The sensation of being filled by a man," said Mei Changsu. He finally started undoing his own clothes. "I've never liked it. But I've wondered with pleasure how tight you would be."The sun was bright by the time Jingyan woke up.He'd fallen asleep in a strange wooden hut. He couldn't remember how. He remembered sliding his blade through a bandit who wore his beard in two braids and he remembered being assaulted until Mei Changsu, chieftain of largest pugilist alliance, stepped in.There should be five hundred pounds of grain delivered to his base if he remembered right.And his sword was broken.After that, his memory was peacefully blank.There was a lingering scent of lavender and Jingyan soon identify its source from a porcelain cruet. Next to the cruet was a clear phial, whose content had been emptied.
"Drink it. You need to ride a horse tomorrow." 
Someone'd said that.His shoulder twanged as he rose and Jingyan pulled the collar of his robes down to observed a patch of bruised skin on his shoulder. There were similar marks on his neck and the other side of his shoulder, but the poisoned wound that'd haunted him for almost a week was healing as it should've been.Puzzled, Jingyan hurried out of the hut and found his horse grazing nearby. With the poison purged from his body, he had no reason to travel to his brother anymore and he could continue fighting until he was due to return to the capital in a month.After that, he would be spending every waking minute avoiding the political scrambles of Prince Yu and the crowned Prince.Who were both currently fixated by a Langya Hall prophesy that whoever acquired a certain "divine talent" would acquire the throne.With one last glance at the house, Jingyan spurred his horse back toward his camp.

Bedroom Talk (BL)
Chapter Summary
A moth draws toward the flame, seeking the pleasure of punishment.



"Why do you always cry afterwards?"Jingyan's eyes were on the candle burning on the table rather than the man behind him, but he could feel the warm tears falling onto  the bare skin of his shoulder and soaking his hair. He lounged on the bed, unresponsive to the arms around his torso or the lips pressed against the side of his neck.After the expected silence, Jingyan moved to stand from the bed. The arms around him tightened and Mei Changsu pressed himself closer. "No. Let me hold you a while longer."He spoke with the same tone he'd used to say things like stop resisting, relax, beg. His voice was clear despite the still-wet cheeks pressed into Jingyan's shoulder blades. With a silent sigh, Jingyan let his head fall back onto the pillow. He wasn't shy, but there was a level of unfairness to how Mei Changsu moved to dress immediately, but refused to let him move."I'll answer your question if you tell me why you never look me in the eyes while I take you," said Mei Changsu.  Jingyan cringed at the choice of words.He glared at nothing in particular, every line of his  body tensed even though he didn't make any move to remove himself from the other's embrace just yet. He suggested in response, "If you want wanton mewls and puppy-dog adoration, Jingrui seems the type.""Is it because you haven't forgiven me?" asked Mei Changsu."There is nothing to forgive," said Jingyan. They were adults, two influential men with substantial manpower and wealth. Besides, he was ten times as strong as Mei Changsu, if that wasn't an underestimation as it was. "That first night, I shouldn't have.."Come. Talked. Surrendered.Then, like a child, he'd thrown a tantrum and refused to speak to Mei Changsu for a week."I took advantage of you," said Mei Changsu."You did," said Jingyan. He didn't like the wording, didn't like how Mei Changsu acted as if he was in complete control."If you give me another chance," Mei Changsu added. He leaned in closer, accentuating his words with a gentle bite on Jingyan's earlobe, "I'd do it again."Jingyan shivered. That night, two months ago, he'd been drawn to the stifling heat of Mei Changsu's room, half-drunk and crying. It was approximately the anniversary of when Xiao Shu died and he'd been crippled by a sudden guilt over the last words he spoke to Xiao Shu thirteen years ago. Along with that, he missed the other terribly and his mother was too busy entertaining his royal father to comfort him.In the end, he'd stumbled through the secret passage and into Mei Changsu's house, seeking the presence of the man who always seemed to welcome him. At first, Mei Changsu only listened as he poked the coal, but Jingyan brought himself closer and Mei Changsu held him. Blurrily, Jingyan could remember when the fabric of Mei Changsu's sleeve were replaced by lips kissing his tears away and his own lack of resistance as Mei Changsu pushed him onto the bed."What is it that you want?" asked Jingyan. "The pride of conquest? An outlet for your sadistic whims?" He paused fully, his real question on the tip of his tongue. His wording was succinct enough when he asked, "If so, then why do you always hold onto me in tears?"Jingyan sometimes wondered if it was guilt, but he didn't like idea of that either."If Lin Shu was still alive," said Mei Changsu. His fingers were drawing lazy circles on Jingyan's stomach now. "Do you think he'd feel gratified knowing you've been pushed from your high horse? Or would he feel angry it was another man?"Since that night, Mei Changsu became fond of talking about Xiao Shu. Jingyan didn't understand, but it'd felt as if his words had unlocked a more hideous part of Mei Changsu's person. Words Mei Changsu once spoke came floating back to him: It is the natural instinct of the wicked to prey on weakness. It is also the natural instinct of a victor. Jingyan's hand fell on the fingers on his body, stilling their idle toying."You manipulate my guilt and remorse in order to coerce me into your arms," Jingyan said coldly. His grip tightened and his fingernails dug into the pale skin. "As if warming your bed is penance for what I said to him."Jingyan wasn't blind to how the events unfolded. It must've been clear to the cunning strategist that Jingyan was reluctant to deny another "friend" after his hurtful rejection became the last words he spoke to Xiao Shu. So, every time Mei Changsu drew close to him, he only looked away until Mei Changsu gripped his chin and forced his gaze back to him.As Mei Changsu brushed his hair away from his face, he murmured, "Isn't it?"Jingyan turned, shifting his body so he laid on his back instead of his side. As always, Mei Changsu's eyes were blank and unrevealing. Jingyan stared up at them, a trace of barely-there disgust in his own eyes. He wasn't sure if he was angry with Mei Changsu or if he was perplexed by how he kept coming back, kept visiting Mei Changsu in unholy hours that only asked for one thing."Can you release my hand? Your grip is very strong," said Mei Changsu.Jingyan released his grip with a faint sneer. The statement was hypocritical. Jingyan would never figure out how Mei Changsu made the myriad of bruises and bite marks on his body but he knew, when Mei Changsu never entered him enough preparation, it was always on purpose.He'd explained once, nonchalantly enough, that the apathy in Jingyan's eyes made him want to hurt him."I hate you," said Jingyan."I know," Mei Changsu answered. He began kissing a gentle trail down Jingyan's chest. "That's why my heart breaks."

"The master said," said Jingyan.The prince lifted a hand to rub away his blurry vision, wondering how on earth could his fingers be so cold when the rest of his body burned like a volcano. He struggled to make out the next word as violent tremors took hold of his whole body, shaking him so hard he crumbled the edge of the book.One second his body was burning and the next, it was freezing. It didn't make sense!His nose was stuffed and if his throat wasn't so raw and inflamed that air could irritate it, he might try to breathe through his mouth. Fluid rattled in his chest with every breath he took and Jingyan weakly swallowed, trying to rid his itchy throat of the phlegm. Vehemently, he tried again, smoothing out the book to read, "The master said...""The master said, 'To make a mistake and not correct it: this is a real mistake,'" came a cheerful voice from the door. Xiao Shu walked in, carrying a tray with a bowl. He kicked the door shut behind him after he entered. "Who studies while they are sick when they fell sick because they studied too much!""Xiao Shu," said Jingyan, voice thick and garbled.He tried to sit up some more and that proved to be a horrible move when the blanket fell off his shoulder and the rush of cool air instantly made him a victim of harsh, hacking coughing. He curled into himself, trying not to cough because the action ripped at his already raw throat. Then, not coughing left his throat clogged and itchy and Jingyan had to cough anyway."You really are in a bad shape," said Xiao Shu. He quickly placed the tray with a hot, syrupy, arhat drink on the table near the bed and tugged the cotton blanket around Jingyan's shoulders again. With a quick swipe, he pulled the book out of Jingyan's hand and tossed it to the side. Xiao Shu patted Jingyan's back several times, purposeful, long strokes that seemed to help with the coughing.Then, his arms wrapped tightly around the weakly shivering body of the other boy. Xiao Shu knew Jingyan was really sick when the other didn't make any awkward sounds and only nuzzled the side of his neck. With something of a smirk, he kissed the top of Jingyan's hair and rested his lips there, feeling Jingyan burrow into his arms as another chill took over his body.The warmth that radiated from the other's body was heaven sent and Jingyan reached a hand out of the blanket cocoon to clutch a fistful of Xiao Shu's shirt. His head pounded with migraine and resting the side of his head on the security of Xiao Shu's chest stilled the notion that his head was going to explode any second. Still, he was a little worried, "Maybe you shouldn't get so close, you might get sick.""I've never gotten sick for more than two days in my life," snickered Xiao Shu. He cuddled Jingyan some more, indulging in Jingyan's complete lack of protest and the cute, needy attempts to snuggle closer. Gently, he ran his fingertips down the side of Jingyan's face, brushing strands of sweat-soaked hair out of his flushed cheeks. "Don't worry about anything, hmm? Don't talk, just let me take care of you."Jingyan nodded, the next words he tried to speak coming out as a faint whimper of protest when Xiao Shu attempted to draw away to pick up the bowl.  The loss of support was unbearable in his current state and he had no idea how he managed before Xiao Shu arrived. Xiao Shu grinned, returning to cradle Jingyan in his arms immediately. "I didn't know you would miss me that quickly."Jingyan attempted to glare at him, but the look came out as something between a pout and snivel. He was beginning to feel embarrassed. With all his strength, he gave his head two shakes and Xiao Shu teased him, loosening his embrace, " No? No, you don't want me here? I should leave then."    Xiao Shu wasn't sure if it was something the sickness did, but Jingyan's eyes suddenly looked wide with unshed tears. The other's unfocused eyes stared back at him, glimmering with fever and misery. Heart melting, Xia Shu leaned in and left a few butterfly kisses on Jingyan's cheek, "You silly water ox, how can I ever leave?"Once again clutched tightly in Xiao Shu's arms, Jingyan felt tired and he wanted to sleep. His body's volatile temperature made sleeping a literal nightmare, but everything felt more constant when he was held like this. Breathing was easier and it didn't take a world's worth of effort to draw in a sliver of air. Xiao Shu made himself comfortable against the headboard of the bed and Jingyan followed the suit, tucking himself in against Xiao Shu's chest. Lulled by the beat of Xiao Shu's heart, he drifted back to unconsciousness as the lonely bowl of arhat syrup cooled on the side.

"The karma from living a life as the Son of Heaven is enough to grant you eternity in Heaven, why waste it on this?"An ethereal blue light pulsed around the bow in Jingyan's hand, absorbing his virtue from him. Through the roar of celestial command, Jingyan responded to the man who sat reading a text long lost to human civilization, "That is why you are not and cannot be Xiao Shu. He would have understood.""Oh," said Mei Changsu. Jingyan looked up and saw him briefly flit his tongue over a finger and flip a page in his book. "It's not that I don't understand. I am only saying it's redundant."Jingyan didn't speak, pointedly watching Mei Changsu's eyes scan the Hebrew text of his book. He knew the man was only going through the motions - they both had the ability to absorb any content without turning the cover. When Mei Changsu finally caught his look, he answered, "I like the gesture of actually reading. We have an eternity, why hurry?"Jingyan shook his head.Warm tendrils of light began to wrap around Jingyan, bringing him back to the time Xiao Shu gave him the bow.<You definitely don't understand.>   The first time, Jingyan didn't realize the original Jingyan of the timeline he stepped into still existed.(No one was more surprised than himself.)   Preventing the Chiyan conspiracy was always easy.What Jingyan didn't predict at first, was Prince Qi's reaction when, two years down the road, he finally realized the extent of his Royal Father's paranoia and hatred. Prince Qi began to rally ministers to support him and the Emperor began to oppose any of Prince Qi's suggestions, even when they were good ones, like lowering the tax on states that suffered from a recent flood.  The entire country became split between father and son.Crimes were committed in the name of one party or another. The other princes and their cohort of corrupted politicians fueled the conflict while siphoning massive amounts of gold from the national treasury.As the internal strife wore the country down, other nations began to attack.When only half of the original Liang remained, the Chiyan army was sent to fight against North Yan.Xiao Shu never returned.      Sometimes, there were things even Jingyan had no power to prevent.(Xiao Shu caught an incurable disease while sneaking out into the city.)   During his longest and most successful excursion, Jingyan stayed at the capital.To the best of his abilities, he warned and directed Prince Qi so his brother did not rile their Royal Father. Prince Qi listened to him half the time and followed his advise half the time he listened. Still, Jingyan diligently cleaned up after his brother, smoothed out any conflict and kept the country stable.His work was good: the Emperor was happy, Liang flourished, the borders were safe and corruption was at an all-time low.Too good, as he'd discovered, when the Emperor humiliated and disposed of the crown prince Xiao Jingyu.At the news, the Chiyan army rebelled, supposedly under the orders of Lin Shu and Prince Qi.Lin Xie executed his son when the rebellion failed.   Sometimes, there were casualties that only Mei Changsu could have prevent.(Xiao Shu was killed by Xie Yu's assassins.)   One time, Jingyan allowed Prince Qi to die.Two months later, Xiao Shu returned from the Meiling and Jingyan returned from the East Sea with a pearl that was the size of a duck's egg. He gave Xiao Shu the pearl and Xiao Shu, in his joy, "accidentally" kissed him in joy. The happiness lasted until he discovered that their idol was executed by the Emperor.Xiao Shu ran away from the palace and hid in the pugilist's world.When "Mei Changsu" became an infamous name, Jingyan didn't have to wonder who he was. Mei Changsu was someone who punished corrupted ministers and robbed the rich to feed the poor. The peasants and law-abiding ministers looked up to him while children were told stories of his deeds.Then, Mei Changsu killed Xia Jiang.   Xia Jiang had captured and tortured one of Mei Changsu's brothers, but the sinister hierarchies of powers didn't care about justice. The Emperor issued a royal decree that included a marvelous reward for Mei Changsu's head and Mei Changsu became the most wanted man in Liang.One day, news arrived that Mei Changsu was betrayed by one of the men close to him.   Sometimes, Jingyan didn't even manage to keep himself alive.(Jingyan was shot to death by a flurry of arrows trying to rescue Xiao Shu's fiancé from Imperial Consort Yue's court.)    Which wasn't the most horrible way to die.    
"So you're not really Jingyan."

"You killed him. Heavens, you killed him."

"I'll kill you."
    ...again.   When Jingyan returned, Mei Changsu pretended not to notice.Mildly irritated, Jingyan waved his hand. The backdrop of an ancient China book room, a setting preferred by Mei Changsu, flickered around them and morphed into a decayed throne room. Mei Changsu bookmarked his book and turned toward Jingyan, one eyebrow raised. "This is almost the equivalent of going into someone's house and breaking everything.""Why is it so hard for you to stay alive and stay happy," Jingyan grumbled. He'd long lost the full range of emotions and what used to be frustration now manifested as apathetic curiosity. The bow rested in his hands, aura visible now that he was in the netherworld again.Mei Changsu pointed out, "If I hadn't gone through a series of unfortunate events, you wouldn't have become the Emperor. As I'd said - redundant.""Yes," answered Jingyan. The paradox was imminent - as long as he had the power to travel back, he would have spent a lifetime as an Emperor. By the nature of that event, Xiao Shu needed to suffer, sin and descend here.The only way for Mei Changsu to ascend Heaven with him was if Xiao Shu died, virtuously and with him, after he spent his life as an Emperor. The bow's glow began to wrap around him again, "So is Heaven when you are here."
