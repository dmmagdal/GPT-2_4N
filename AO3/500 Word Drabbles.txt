Just Another Night
Chapter Summary
Day 40: Chuuya didn't expect to see Dazai that night.



“Wine, please.”Chuuya almost spits his own wine out upon hearing that voice. The only reason he doesn't is because good wine should not be wasted on the account of a man such as Dazai Osamu.“This is a Port Mafia bar,” Chuuya hisses.Dazai laughs as he takes a sip of his drink. Chuuya stares a little as Dazai licks the stray droplet of wine from his lips. He looks away quickly but Dazai chuckles and Chuuya knows that he had been caught.“There’s no Port Mafia sign hanging at the entrance,” Dazai replies easily as he inches closer to Chuuya who pointedly doesn't look back at him. “And I like what I saw inside.”Dazai’s just messing with him – Chuuya knows that, but it doesn't stop him from flushing anyway.“It’s Port Mafia territory,” Chuuya retorts. He glares at Dazai. “You know that; you helped take over this place.”“We did ~” Dazai corrects with a grin. He holds his glass up. “To us.”Chuuya raises an eyebrow.Dazai shrugs. “To the alliance between the Port Mafia and the Armed Detective Agency.”Chuuya shrugs as he raises his wine glass and clinks it against Dazai’s. Chuuya finishes his wine in one mouth since there wasn't much left in it anyway. He’d like another glass but he has a meeting early tomorrow. To his surprise, Dazai orders another glass of wine.“I thought you prefer whiskey,” Chuuya says without thinking.Dazai laughs before he smiles at Chuuya. “Hat rack knows me so well ~”“And here I thought we were going to last the night without resorting to childish insults,” Chuuya says before his lips curve into a smirk. “Bandaged bastard.”Dazai’s eyes twinkle at the familiar nickname.Chuuya’s surprised that Dazai orders another drink after his second glass. He orders a whiskey this time and Chuuya knows that Dazai has a high alcohol tolerance but he usually doesn’t drink too much at a bar.“Did something happen?” Chuuya asks before he can stop himself.Dazai pauses before he shakes his head. “I just felt like coming here today and I’m in the mood for drinking.”Chuuya hums. He feels like there’s something up but he isn’t going to pry if Dazai doesn't want to share.Chuuya ends up paying for their drinks because Dazai apparently forgot his wallet.“And what would you have done if I wasn't there?”They walk down the streets in silence and it’s almost like the old times. Chuuya admits that he had been hurt when Dazai left but it eventually eased to a dull ache and now all he remembers are their happy memories. And this alliance had given them a chance to work together again; it feels like they can start over.Chuuya feels Dazai staring at him and it becomes annoying enough that he turns to glare at him.“I missed you, Chuuya,” Dazai says when their eyes meet.
Oh, so this is what it’s about.
Chuuya laughs. “I missed you too, dumbass.”

“Still making a mess as usual, Dazai.”Dazai immediately stops feeding and looks up from his victim to meet startling blue eyes. Chuuya’s lips curve into a smirk, and Dazai can’t tear his eyes away from him. It has been at least a century and Chuuya still looks as beautiful as ever. He probably still tastes as –“Ow, Kunikida-kun, what is that for!?!” Dazai demands as he rubs the sore spot on his head.Kunikida gives him a disgusted glance and points at his mouth. “Clean it.”Dazai knows he means with a handkerchief so he wipes the blood away with the back of his hand instead, causing Kunikida to glare at him before he turns his attention to Chuuya.“Nakahara.”“Kunikida,” Chuuya purrs in response and as amusing as it is to see Kunikida turn red, Dazai doesn't quite like how Chuuya is behaving.His eyes turn crimson and he steps in front of Kunikida.“Let me entertain our envoy from the Port Mafia while you set up the meeting room, Kunikida-kun,” Dazai says stiffly.Kunikida disappears immediately and Chuuya throws his head back and laughs. Dazai knows he’s doing it on purpose but he can’t help but be drawn to the expanse of pale skin and he has already inched too close before he even realises that he has moved.“Oh, Dazai,” Chuuya says as he steps nearer. He tilts his head up, his lips ghosting over Dazai’s. “You haven’t changed one bit.”Dazai bends down, leaving a hair’s breadth between them and whispers, “you’re still as short as ever too, hat rat.”Chuuya pulls away with a growl, his fangs extending. Dazai remains calm through it all and only laughs when he hears a familiar but outraged ‘Chuuya’.“Ane-san,” he greets pleasantly.Kouyou ignores him in favour of glaring at Chuuya. “Behave.”“Ane-san,” Chuuya grumbles.Dazai pales. “Please don’t tell me – ”“Ah, Dazai-kun, it has been a while.”Dazai stares at Mori in disdain. Really?“What did you expect?” Chuuya asks with a scoff. “We only meet once every century.”“I’d be willing to see more of him if it means seeing more of you.”Chuuya rolls his eyes and sweeps past Dazai into the meeting room. Dazai looks after him longingly and turns pleading eyes onto Kouyou.“Surely you can put in a good word for me?”Kouyou laughs lightly. “Good luck.”It sounds more like ‘drop dead’.After the meeting, Dazai manages to corner Chuuya alone in the corridor and the redhead isn’t even surprised or impressed as he glares up at Dazai.“What the hell do you want?”Dazai lowers his head to stare into Chuuya’s blue eyes and trails his hand down along Chuuya’s face. He feels Chuuya’s breath hitch as he bends down, his breath ticking the skin of Chuuya’s ear, and that makes him confident enough to slide an arm around Chuuya’s waist.“For old time’s sake?” he asks.Dazai is slammed against the wall before the question is even finished.

“No, no, no, Kunikida-kun,” Dazai says impatiently as he grabs his luggage off the baggage conveyor belt. “You can meet the curator and tell him my terms.”“You need to negotiate with him personally,” Kunikida snaps.“No negotiations... I don’t like the layout; ask them to change it. End of story.”“Dazai, you – ”“I’m sorry,” someone interrupts, “but are you Dazai Osamu-san? I’m Nakahara Chuuya, the curator who’s in charge of the exhibition.”“Ah, yes, I’m Kunikida Doppo, his agent. Please give us a minute because Dazai is being a – ”Dazai shoves Kunikida aside and flashes a bright smile as he holds out his hand. “I am Dazai Osamu indeed! I have to say, I really like the theme of the exhibition and the layout.”Chuuya beams. “Thank you! It’s my first job and I was really worried about it.”“Oh, everything is fine and I – ” Dazai gest cut off when Kunikida elbows him harshly.“Please give us a minute,” Kunikida says to a wide-eyed Chuuya before he drags Dazai away. He glares at the artist. “What were you saying to me just now?”Dazai sighs and glances over Kunikida’s shoulders. “I’m feeling inspired to draw.”“…. Really?”“Have you ever seen such a beautiful person before? Do you think he’ll agree to a double suicide?”Kunikida doesn't even respond as he hits Dazai across the head harshly with his schedule book. He stalks back to Chuuya, deciding that it’s much better if Dazai doesn't meet with the curator after all. No one deserves to suffer Dazai’s existence. Trust him, he knows.“Nakahara-san, I - ”Dazai pushes him aside. “Nakahara-san, I was thinking we could have lunch while we discuss the details of the exhibition. Your idea is excellent but I have some ideas as well.”“Of course! I’ve already made a reservation at a restaurant.”“That’s perfect!”Kunikida stares at Dazai suspiciously all throughout lunch even after Dazai has proven that he’s not being a besotted fool and can still stand his ground. Chuuya’s ideas are actually really good for an amateur and while Dazai admits that he would have been a lot harsher if it hadn’t been this particular redhead who showed up at the airport, he couldn’t deny passion when he sees it.“I can’t believe people warned me about you,” Chuuya says with a chuckle before he freezes. He shoots Dazai a worried glance. “I mean – ”“It’s okay,” Dazai says with a laugh, ignoring Kunikida’s cough of ‘I told you so’. Dazai has high expectations and he wants his art to be displayed a certain way; he can’t help it if people have a problem with that. “I guess you can tell them that they’re wrong now.”Chuuya smiles at Dazai in response, only looking away with a slight flush on his face when Kunikida coughs pointedly. The agent excuses himself because he has another appointment and Dazai shifts his chair closer to Chuuya’s once his agent disappears.“So, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?”

“Are you sure about this?”Chuuya looks over to his client who’s staring back at him with a serene smile on his face. His blue eyes fall to the cigarette in Dazai’s hand and the man offers it to him. Chuuya reaches over to take it and Dazai says, “you can have as many cigarettes as you want in Tokyo.”Chuuya snatches his hand back and glares at Dazai. The man merely chuckles.“I’ve told you a billion times – I refuse to be one of your trophies.”“Oh, Chuuya, you should know that that’s an offer many here would die for.”Chuuya tilts his head. “Offer it to them then.”Dazai narrows his eyes as he stands up and approaches Chuuya. He looks down at the redhead with a heated gaze. “I only want you.”Chuuya meets his gaze evenly. “I’m fine here.”Dazai shakes his head and pulls back with a chuckle as he gestures around the fancy room they’re in. It looks glamorous just as Chuuya does in his yukata and makeup but it doesn't change the fact that he’s still just a courtesan.“So what if you live forever, Chuuya? This is all you’ll ever have and sleeping with random men is all you’ll ever do. Come with me to Tokyo and I’ll show you what life is truly about.”Chuuya would be lying if he said that he wasn't tempted. Their society is fucked up and while Kouyou takes really good care of the people in this establishment, it doesn't change the fact that they live in a destitute prefecture. Most people in Yokohama never have more than twenty-four hours on their arms and bodies with zeros stamped into their skin litter the streets. Chuuya spends most of his time in his room reading, writing or playing instruments.He has heard tales of Tokyo, of how everyone lives life without thinking about the time they have left because everyone generally has a good decade or so. And men like Dazai, those who are in positions of power, those people have at least five decades on their arms and Chuuya is sure that he has a vault full of time capsules. After all, Dazai is the boss of the biggest conglomerate in Japan – Port Mafia.Dazai sits next to Chuuya and grabs his hands. “If you were with me,” he says fervently, “I wouldn't even think of any of those other men or women.”Kouyou had said that it’s his choice but Chuuya knows that she doesn't want him to go. A man from Tokyo had cheated her once but she’s a survivor. Chuuya doesn't know if he can be as strong as her if Dazai were to suddenly abandon him. At least this way he gets to keep Dazai’s attention and he’s sure that there’ll be a roof over his head.“Maybe ask me next time, Dazai,” Chuuya says eventually.Dazai laughs and drops his hands. “You can’t ask me to wait forever, Chuuya.”Chuuya laughs. He knows.

Dazai hums merrily to himself as he sails his boat out to sea. The sun hangs high overhead and scatters its light across the surface of the water. A smirk comes onto his lips as he sees the water stirring. His ears pick up the sound of something surging towards him a second later and he turns his head to the side just as Chuuya breaks the surface of the water. Watching the merman flick the water off his hair as he smiles at Dazai is definitely the favourite part of Dazai’s day.“Dazai!” Chuuya greets happily as he swims closer to the boat. “You’re early today.”“I finished my studies earlier today,” Dazai replies with a shrug. He holds out a hand in offer. “Come on in.”Chuuya takes his hand and Dazai helps him into the boat. He admires the brilliant reddish golden colour of Chuuya’s scales for a few seconds before they start to change into a pair of creamy legs. Dazai continues staring shamelessly.“Pervert,” Chuuya grouses as he holds a hand out.Dazai laughs as he passes him a yukata. Once Chuuya is appropriately dressed, he tackles Dazai and the man has to hold on to his hips to make sure they both don’t fall overboard. Chuuya’s legs are on either side of Dazai and his eyes are misted with lust. He leans in closer and wraps his arms around Dazai’s neck.“I’ve missed you,” he breathes against Dazai’s lips before he seals their mouths together.Dazai responds immediately as he loops his arms around Chuuya, pressing them closer together. When they part, he leans his forehead against Chuuya’s.“I wish we could be together every day,” Dazai murmurs.“We do see each other day,” Chuuya replies with a chuckle.Dazai pulls back. “I don’t mean that, Chuuya. I mean I want you to be the first thing I see every morning.”Chuuya smiles at Dazai as he cups his cheek. “I want that too.” And then he bites his lower lip and frowns. “But we’re so different.”Dazai sighs as he brings Chuuya into an embrace. They had an argument once. Dazai’s a samurai in training; he can’t possibly give up everything he has worked so hard for all his life and Chuuya has his responsibilities too.“Chuuya.”The redhead stiffens in Dazai’s arms and Dazai looks over to see a mermaid glaring at them, her arms folded over her chest. Ah, Kouyou. She had tried to drown Dazai the last time they met.“Hi,” Dazai says. Kouyou glares.“Ane-san…” Chuuya murmurs as he looks over.“We’re going home. Now.”“But – ”“It’s okay, Chuuya,” Dazai says softly. “Let’s not anger her. I’ll see you tomorrow.”Chuuya pouts but nods. He kisses Dazai on the cheek quickly, making Kouyou growl, before jumping into the water.“See you tomorrow,” he mouths to Dazai before he swims away.Dazai smiles though it quickly dies on his lips when he sees Kouyou’s icy glare just before she leaves.

Dazai hits the punching bag repeatedly, his face contorted into a frown and his body tense. He's supposed to feel better but all he feels is more frustration building up. Dazai's so engrossed in his feelings that he doesn't hear the approaching footsteps."You need to let it out," a voice says, startling Dazai. He doesn't show it though he stops punching and holds the bag as it comes swinging back to him. He takes in the appearance of the stranger. Slender, red hair, bright blue eyes. Short. He has never seen him before, but he's definitely someone from the Mafia since this gym is for their exclusive use. Dazai hadn't expected anyone to be here at this time; it's almost midnight."What do you know?""I know that if you keep this up without letting it out, you'll only feel more frustration," the redhead answers simply.The words hit way too close to home and that annoys Dazai more than anything. "Get lost.""I'm only trying to help."Dazai turns back to the other boy and he can't deny that he's intrigued. The redhead is quite something to look at too and Dazai's lips curve into a smirk. "Maybe you could help?"The redhead makes a face. "What are you, 13?""14.""I'm the same age but seriously?""It's a joke," Dazai says. He stares at the redhead. Surprisingly, the other boy doesn't flinch. He merely stares back and raises an eyebrow. Confidence. Dazai likes it. "You honestly look too weak to be in the Mafia."Again, to his surprise, the redhead simply throws his head back and laughs. Dazai finds that he likes his laugh. It's clear and bright, a chime in the storm. He must be new to the Mafia; Dazai resists the urge to scoff. He wouldn't be laughing like this for long.The redhead steps over to the punching bag next to Dazai and Dazai’s eyes fly open the moment the other starts attacking the bag. His movements are swift, so swift that the sound of his fists hitting the bag is absorbed by the next punch so that there's only silence in the room. In the end, he swings his leg up and kicks the equipment right off its hook. Without saying another word, the redhead starts to leave. Dazai's too stunned to say anything. The redhead opens the door but tosses a wink and smirk over his shoulder before leaving. "Nice to meet you, demon prodigy."Dazai frowns. "Who are you?"There's that laugh again. "Wouldn't you like to know?"The next time Dazai sees the redhead, it's a year later and they're apparently supposed to be partners. Apparently, the redhead had been in the Mafia as long as Dazai and is Kouyou’s charge. He laughs without a care in the world as he says, "I'm Nakahara Chuuya. Nice to meet you, Dazai."Two years later, Chuuya laughs that same laughter as he pulls away from Dazai's lips. "Took you long enough, genius.”

Chuuya smiles, red painted lips softening his features. The kimono he’s wearing compliments the crimson of his lips and the softer hue of his hair, and the Alpha he’s with is staring shamelessly at the white expanse of his exposed shoulder. The man leans in closer to him and Chuuya glances away slightly. An imposing presence looms over them and Chuuya looks up to see Dazai staring down at the other Alpha.“Da- Dazai-san.”Dazai raises an eyebrow. The man scrams. Dazai doesn’t even bother looking after him, his gaze already fixed on Chuuya, making him feel chilled and exposed. Dazai holds out a hand.“Let’s go to your room.”Chuuya’s smile eases into a natural happiness and he takes the proffered hand.Chuuya closes the room doors behind him and when he turns around, Dazai’s already there to pull him into an embrace. He sighs as he leans his head against Dazai’s chest, his arms wrapping around Dazai’s back.“You came,” he says. “I thought you were busy this week.”“I finished my work early,” Dazai says simply. Chuuya knows how to read between the lines – I missed you.Dazai guides Chuuya to the bed and sits down next to the redhead. He takes Chuuya’s hands in his and there’s a possessive glint in his eyes as he says, “I hate it when those men look at you as if they have a chance of owning you.”Chuuya hates it, hates that people –Alphas – think they can own him. He hates that Dazai thinks that too but it’s in their biology so what can he say? Dazai seems to know though – he sighs at Chuuya’s silence but doesn't say anything.Dazai lets go of Chuuya’s hands and he goes to the table to pour himself a cup of sake. Chuuya should be pouring the drink for him but Dazai lets him get away with things like these and it almost makes Chuuya feel like an equal.“Why did you really come here today?” Chuuya asks because it’s never simple with Dazai. He might have feelings for this Alpha and Dazai might treat him more than just an Omega, but that’s still what they are and Dazai isn’t eager to change the status quo.Dazai drowns the sake in one shot and pours another cup, offering it to Chuuya. The redhead takes a seat at the table. He takes a sip, watching as Dazai drinks another cup.“I’ve been promoted to an Executive.”Chuuya feels uneasy even though he should be happy for Dazai.“And?”“And I asked Mori to give you to me as my present.”Chuuya freezes. “You mean – ”“Yes, Chuuya, you’re going to be mated to me. It’ll happen tomorrow night.”“You have no rights to – ”“I do,” Dazai snaps and he stands up. He glares down at Chuuya. “It’ll happen tomorrow, Omega, whether you like it or not.”Dazai sweeps out of the room and Chuuya closes his eyes as a tear slides down his face.

Chapter Notes

        See the end of the chapter for  notes




Chuuya yawns as he stretches his arms over his head. The sun is slowly making its way up beyond the sea and it’s about time he headed off to work.“A beautiful sunset! Ruined by the hat rack blocking my view!”“Bandaged bastard, if you say another word, I’ll kick you into the sea.”Dazai lets out a gasp. “You know I prefer drifting along the river.”“The sea is bigger; you can drift longer.”“Chuuya! I never knew you cared so much about me!”“Shut the fuck up.”Chuuya frowns as a droplet of water falls onto his nose. He glances up at the sky and curses himself for not thinking to bring an umbrella out. He doesn't have one stored in his car either. Guess he has to leave.Dazai takes a seat beside him before he moves and casually opens an umbrella over their heads.“Let’s wait it out,” he says. “It’s probably only going to be a short drizzle.”Chuuya hums in acknowledgment.A can of coffee enters his field of vision and he turns to raise an eyebrow at Dazai. The detective beams and holds up a plastic bag from 7/11.“Breakfast!”“And you just happened to have bought breakfast for two?”“Of course not,” Dazai says with a scoff. His voice softens as he says, “I knew you would be here.”Of course he would. Coming to watch the sunrise by the sea is something that Chuuya has been doing since even before Dazai became his partner. It became their tradition for a while because Dazai started joining him and then one day he just didn't turn up.And now he suddenly turns up again.Warm nostalgia tugs at his heart. He takes the canned coffee from Dazai and accepts the bread as well. Even after all these years, Dazai still remembers what he likes. Chuuya sighs as he leans against Dazai’s arm. He feels the other man stiffening and smiles a little. He always did like seeing Dazai being tensed; it’s so rare to see Dazai being surprised at something after all.“Hey,” Chuuya starts, “it doesn't feel as if we have changed that much, huh?”Dazai laughs, bright and clear. “No, it really doesn't.” And then, “you’re still wearing atrocious hats.”Chuuya scoffs. “And you’re still wrapping yourself up in bandages.”They share a laugh over that. It’s followed by a terse silence, one that Chuuya recognises as Dazai wanting to say something serious. He’s usually patient at times like this because it’s incredibly rare for Dazai to expose a vulnerable part of himself. But it’s taking way too long this time.Chuuya glances upwards but the words die on his tongue when he realises that Dazai had been staring at him all this while. He catches brown orbs and thinks that they’re really beautiful like this as they reflect the sunrise.Dazai leans down and captures his lips in a kiss and Chuuya smiles because words aren’t needed for this.

Chuuya leans down close to his horse as the animal sprints through the forest. He had received the message from the castle three days ago and had been traveling nonstop ever since. If it’s true that he’s going to make a comeback that night then Chuuya has to be there before he appears.The guards let him through the gates immediately and Chuuya jumps off his horse the moment they reach the entrance of the castle. He doesn't pause to greet anyone as he races to the throne room. He pushes open the door and heaves a sigh of relief when he sees that the circle in the centre of the room is still empty. The circle is outlined with black powder that’s pulsating with light. It’ll soon be time.“Chuuya.”Chuuya lets Kouyou sweep him into a hug. They embrace tightly before she steps away and Chuuya nods to Mori, the Alpha of their clan.“Is it true?” Chuuya asks because he needs to hear it even if it already seems obvious. “Is Dazai coming back?”Mori spares a glance towards the circle before looking back to Chuuya. His eyes are grave as he nods.“Are you sure you want to be here? He’ll be angry upon seeing you.”“Well I’m the one who betrayed and killed him. If he wants to take his revenge, let it be upon me and only me.”Kouyou glares at him sharply for his words but remains otherwise silent. Dazai had been a volatile individual when he had been alive. He hadn’t been part of their clan; he had been a grim reaper that had become a little too bloodthirsty. Chuuya had loved him but letting such a monster roam free would have cost too many lives.“Chuuya, I doubt Dazai’s idea of revenge would be pleasant,” Mori says.Chuuya shrugs and smiles tersely. “I guess not.”The light starts to increases in brightness and starts shimmering at a rapid speed. Chuuya narrows his eyes.“I think it’s best if you leave the room.”“Chuuya, if you think for a second – ”“Kouyou,” Mori says softly as he takes her by the arm. “Let’s listen to him.”Kouyou remains still for a few stubborn seconds but she eventually relents. She gives Chuuya one last hug before she stalks out of the room. Mori nods to him, face calm but eyes worried, before he too leaves.The moment the door shuts behind them, the room is enveloped in a bright blue light that Chuuya doesn't shield his eyes away from. When the light clears, there’s a cloaked being standing in the middle of the circle. The figure looks up and pushes his hood off his head. Dazai still looks as smug as ever. He swings his scythe, the silver of the sharp edge catching the moonlight. Chuuya’s reminded of the crimson that stains it.“It’s nice to see you again, Chuuya,” Dazai greets with a crazed grin.Chuuya scoffs. “Wish I could say the same.”

Chuuya smiles as he walks through the streets, nodding at his men who bow at the sight of him. It's only when he's behind closed doors that he lets out a sigh. The Port Mafia is expanding their territory rapidly and while Chuuya is confident in putting them down, he doesn't know if that's the best route. Attacking the Port Mafia when they have trespassed on The Sheep's land is his right but if it evolves into a full-scale war... he doesn't have enough resources as it is. If the Port Mafia were to attack them full force, he'd be sending his men to their deaths.Chuuya groans and buries his head in his hands.A chuckle echoes from somewhere in the room and Chuuya snaps to attention. His eyes narrow as he glares into the darkness, knowing that there's someone hiding there. Sure enough, a tall man wearing a black coat emerges from the shadows and Chuuya slams his fist against the table as he stands up. Port Mafia. The man steps into the light and he tilts his head, accentuating his sharp jawline and Chuuya's demand of "who are you" comes out way more interested than he intended."Oh, Chuuya, I knew you fell in love with me at first sight," the man says and Chuuya snaps out of it."How the hell do you know my name?""Hat rack - ""HAH?"" - I’ve come from the future and I'm here to help with your little dilemma.""... Like an Ability sent you here?"Dazai shrugs. "Something like that.""... Okay...""Listen, the Port Mafia will send an envoy to negotiate with you a few days form now. You are going to attack him and give him a permanent scar on his head. Please, for heaven's sake, refrain from doing that.""Uh huh.""I'm being serious. He is to be your future partner and also love of your life.""HAH?""Yes," the man says gravely with a nod. "Just know that no matter what happens in the future, he loves you too."While Chuuya had been rather accepting of the man's explanation at first (Abilities are weird), he can't help but wonder if the man is actually okay. He doesn't have much time to dwell on that when the man stalks over and pulls him into a tight hug. Chuuya stiffens and his eyes widen when he feels the soft press of kiss against his forehead."Please don't give him that scar."And the man disappears.Two days later, an envoy from Port Mafia indeed comes and Chuuya snorts, saying, "you are way hotter when you're older."Dazai Osamu stares at him in confusion. "Have we met?" And then he turns his nose up. "That is ugliest shade of green I have ever seen, chibi. The Sheep? More like The Shit."And Chuuya never did promise the older Dazai not to give him that scar. Dazai groans in pain as he clutches his head and Chuuya smirks in satisfaction."Now, let's talk."

“Watch out!”Dazai looks up from his sketch and his eyes widen as he sees someone on a broom headed straight for him. Shocked still, he doesn't manage to dodge in time and the person crashes into him, sending them both sprawling across the grass field. Dazai groans as he lands on his back but he doesn't get a moment of respite because something falls on him a second later. Dazai groans again at the added weight. He opens his eyes to see a bewildered looking redhead staring at him with bright blue eyes."I'm so sorry! Are you okay? I didn't mean it!"Dazai shakes his head slowly. "It's fine."He tries to sit up, forgetting that the other is still on him, and their faces end up being way too close to each other. Dazai's eyes widen and he immediately flops back onto the ground, his face burning. The other leaps off him and Dazai steals a glance and sees that his face is bright red as well. Dazai chuckles and gets to his feet."What's your name?""Huh? My name... oh! I'm Nakahara Chuuya!""A witch, huh?" Dazai asks as he looks at the fallen broom lying a few meters away from them."Yes," Chuuya says though his face is still pink. He walks over to retrieve his broom and sits next do Dazai. "I'm looking for a new town.""And you stumbled upon this one?"Chuuya jabs him harshly in the ribs for that but Dazai laughs anyway."It was an accident. I was supposed to fix the broom before I left my previous town but I was hasty in leaving.""Bad experience?"Chuuya shrugs. "Something like that.""Well, if you need a place to stay, I live alone and there's a spare room.”Chuuya smiles at him and Dazai looks away as he coughs into his hand. He is being way too affected by someone he has just met."So, what do you do?" Dazai asks."Oh, I make medicine and stuff," Chuuya says. That's when Chuuya spies his drawing. "You draw?""I'm an artist," Dazai says. "I'm not very good but I make enough to get by."Chuuya takes his book from him and his eyes sparkle."This is really good," Chuuya gushes as he starts flipping through the pages."Can I draw you?" Dazai blurts out.Chuuya looks stunned for a moment before he throws his head back and laugh. He flashes Dazai a grin."Sure thing."Just then, a black cat walks over to them. Chuuya smiles and picks it up. “Corruption, I made a friend, Dazai.""Hey," Dazai greets.The black cat meows at him before curling up in Chuuya's lap. The redhead starts laughing and he says, "Corruption says you look funny.""That's not very nice," Dazai says with a pout."Well," Chuuya says, "let's get going, shall we? You need time to draw me after all."He winks at Dazai and the man thinks that he’s definitely done for.

Annoying Help
Chapter Summary
Day 51: Chuuya wouldn't be here if he didn't need Dazai's help. (detective/demon AU)
Chapter Notes

        See the end of the chapter for  notes




Chuuya walks into the large abandoned theatre house. His footsteps echo loudly in the empty space and he sighs. Chuuya stops in the middle and folds his arms. He clears his throat. There's no response. He clears his throat again as he starts tapping his foot against the ground impatiently. Again, the only sounds are those of what he produces.“Oi, fucking Dazai, any time now.”Amused chuckles immediately fill the air though Dazai is nowhere to be seen.“Oh, Chuuya, if you were so desperate to see me, you could have just said so.”Chuuya is severely unimpressed and he lets it show on his face, knowing that Dazai would be able to see it.“Dazai,” Chuuya growls.The man appears in front of him and Chuuya shrieks as he stumbles backwards. Dazai catches him around the waist with a laugh as he pulls Chuuya flushed against him.“Careful now, hat rack.”In his flustered state, Chuuya doesn't register the nickname that he abhors so much. When it finally clicks, he snarls at Dazai and pushes the other away from him. “Fuck you, bandaged bastard. Now help me.”Dazai rolls his eyes, muttering how boring Chuuya is under his breath. Chuuya doesn't rise to the bait; he is here on serious business. He has a case to solve and if he weren't so desperate, he wouldn't be asking this annoying gremlin for help. Dazai might be a powerful demon but he is such an unhelpful one. If Chuuya hadn't accidentally stumbled across this godforsaken place a few years ago, he could have saved himself a lot of headaches... okay, fine, so the truth might have been a little different. He had been running away from a crazy murderer whom he had unfortunately caught the eye of and had stumbled across the abandoned theatre on the outskirts of town. Long story short: Dazai saved him and the demon is never going to let him leave it down, even if Chuuya's no longer a helpless teen but a respectable detective now.“Dazai, please? This asshole has already killed five people.”Dazai sighs. “The things I do for you.”Chuuya doesn't want to know what that's supposed to mean. Dazai smiles at him and gestures for him to come closer. Chuuya eyes the man suspiciously but approaches him anyway. Dazai beams widely and offers him his cheek.“I need something in return for my help, Chuuya ~”Chuuya stares at him, completely unimpressed.Dazai pouts. “Chuuya!!”“Tell me what to look out for first.”“Hey, that isn't the deal.”“Take it or leave it.”“Who's asking whom for help!”Chuuya raises an eyebrow. Dazai grumbles to himself for a bit before relenting with a sigh.“You're looking for a middle aged man who has a birthmark on his back.”“Dazai – ”“I can't tell you more than that, Chuuya.”“Fine.”Dazai smiles and moves closer to Chuuya.“Idiot,” Chuuya murmurs even as he smiles, leaning forward to press a kiss against the demon's cheek.

Chuuya strides into the hospital. Just before he turns the corner, he whips his phone out to check the message again.
Chuuya-san, please come. Something has happened to Dazai-san.
Atsushi hadn't explained what nor did he pick his phone up when Chuuya had called him so Chuuya had no choice but to come down personally even though he has better things to do on a Sunday morning than visit a bandaged wasting machine. He rounds the corner and spots Atsushi standing outside the room. The teen stands up straight upon seeing him and bows as he nears him.“Chuuya-san, thank you for coming.”“What happened?”“Dazai-san was in a car accident.”Chuuya's heart plummets but he maintains an indifferent mien. “Suicide attempt gone wrong?”Atsushi shakes his head. “It was an accident. He was chasing a suspect.”That doesn't make Chuuya feel any better. “And why am I here?”“He wants to see you.”Chuuya raises an eyebrow. He and Dazai have spent their whole lives actively not wanting to see each other so what's the deal with the idiot now?“Did he hit his head too hard?”“You can say that.”Chuuya looks over at the sound of the new voice to see Kunikida stepping out of the ward and closing the door behind him.“He has amnesia, Chuuya-san.”It's Atsushi who answers; Kunikida is pointedly not looking at him for some reason.“So he still thinks he's in the Mafia or something?”“Not exactly...” Atsushi trails off, shooting Kunikida a concerned look but the older man just stares at the opposite wall and doesn't say anything. Atsushi looks back at Chuuya helplessly. “You'll know when you see him.”Chuuya wants to demand an answer but Atsushi doesn't seem capable of helping him any further so he rolls his eyes and enters the ward.“Oi, mackerel, you wanted to see me?”“Slug, you're here,” Dazai says with a smirk.Chuuya frowns as he takes a seat next to the bed. Dazai seems perfectly normal and god help Atsushi if it turns out that this is just a prank that Dazai had roped him into. Kunikida doesn't seem like he would go along with this though.“What's wrong with you?” Chuuya asks and startles a little when Dazai takes his hand.“I thought I wouldn't be able to see you again,” Dazai murmurs.Chuuya stares back at him in bewilderment.“Suicide's nice and all but I think I prefer staying by your side.”“Dazai... what about...”What about Kunikida? Because Chuuya knows that they're together. No, no one told him; he just knows. It's Dazai after all.*Chuuya lets out a sigh as he steps out of the room. Atsushi looks at him guiltily.“I see.”Atsushi nods.Chuuya glances at Kunikida but the other man speaks before he can.“He has always loved you, you know.”Chuuya scoffs. He knows. He has always loved Dazai too. But what he says is, “well, he's yours now,” before he walks away.

Chuuya takes a mouthful of coffee, his eyes never leaving the laptop. screen. He groans when he realises that he’s stuck. He reaches across the table for the book and jumps when a hand touches his own.“Shitty Dazai!” he exclaims after snatching his hand back and looking up to see his boyfriend smirking at him lazily. Dazai’s hair is tousled and it’s clear that he just got out of bed. Chuuya frowns. “Why are you up so early?” he glances at the clock. “It’s only three.”Dazai pouts as he takes a seat next to Chuuya. “The nerve of you to ask me that when you promised to come to bed by midnight.”Chuuya hides his laughter under a scoff. Dazai might be complaining like a childish brat but Chuuya can see the unveiled concern in his eyes as he stares at the cup of coffee in disdain.“Seriously, Chuuya, this is unhealthy.”“I know,” Chuuya says, letting out a groan as he takes the book and fiddles with it. “But this is due in two days and makes up 100% of my grade.” He shoots Dazai a pointed look. “As if you didn't already know that.”Dazai scoffs lightly as he takes Chuuya’s laptop and starts reading what the redhead has written.“That’s why I told you not to leave it till it’s too late.”Chuuya pouts. He knows but procrastination is a large issue for him and there are other things that distract him as well, like his upcoming performance.“Yes, I know you’ve been working your ass off for your dance performance,” Dazai says before Chuuya even opens his mouth. “Still.”“Stop rubbing it in,” Chuuya complains as he flips open the book. As soon as he does, he lets out a yawn and Dazai looks over to him with a frown on his face.“Chuuya,” he says gently, “you aren’t going to be able to write anything properly if you’re this tired.”“I know…”“Come here for a while.”Chuuya places his book back onto the table as he makes his way to Dazai.“Hm?”Dazai stands up and takes him by the hand, leading him to the sofa. He sits down before gently tugging Chuuya into his lap.“Rest for a bit,” he murmurs against Chuuya’s hair.Chuuya’s first reaction is to pull away and attempt to stand. “But I don’t have time…”“Yes,” Dazai says patiently even as he tightens his hold on Chuuya. “But take a nap for an hour and do it here so it won’t be hard for you to wake up. I’ll make sure you get up after an hour, trust me.”“But…”Dazai shushes his boyfriend; he can already feel Chuuya becoming limp in his hold and bites back a comment about Chuuya being a slug.“You don’t have to do this,” Chuuya says eventually as he settles himself more comfortably in Dazai’s arms.“Idiot,” Dazai says softly and smiles when he realises that Chuuya has fallen asleep.

Only The Truth
Chapter Summary
Chuuya's high on morphine. [Black Era] (Day 54)
Chapter Notes
I was watching that Grey's Anatomy scene where Meredith was high on morphine.



Chuuya giggles, looking absolutely delighted. Dazai stares at him and raises an eyebrow.“You do realise you’ll probably need an operation right?”Chuuya just laughs again. Whatever he wants to say is abruptly cut off as the door opens to reveal Mori and Kouyou.“Boss! Ane-san!” Chuuya greets happily as he attempts to stand. Dazai immediately places his hands on Chuuya’s legs and shakes his head.“Stay put!”“Indeed,” Mori says, looking rather amused. Kouyou scoffs lightly as she walks over to Chuuya.“How are you feeling?”“Peachy,” Chuuya replies with a grin before he sighs and leans back against the pillow. “You know, I didn’t really want to join the Port Mafia at first. You guys were such bullies and kept intruding on my turf.”Dazai and Kouyou tense as they exchange glances before looking at Mori. Their boss just looks thoroughly entertained as he takes a seat.“Is that so, Chuuya-kun?”“Uh-huh. And, no offense, Boss, but you looked like a greasy, perverted old man.”“Chuuya,” Kouyou says sharply and Chuuya pouts at her.“And that’s why no one believes you when you tell them your age, Ane-san! You look beautiful but you look so stern and you sound like my mom.”Kouyou narrows her eyes at him but Chuuya’s attention is already on Dazai.“Oh and you.”Dazai stares back at him, arms folded and severely unimpressed.“What about me, hat rack?”“I wanted to send you to the ER the first time I laid eyes on you and it’s not because you’re wrapped in bandages – that deserves a visit to the psych ward – but because you look so absolutely infuriating with that pompous look and holier-than-thou manner of speaking. Like, who do you think you are?”Dazai opens his mouth but Chuuya interrupts him.“But the bandages and that attitude was actually really hot, so much so that I wanted to punch you.”Dazai’s mouth slowly falls open as he processes the words. Mori chuckles while Kouyou stares at Chuuya openly in disapproval.“Chuuya, you – ”“And your friend. Damn was he hot too.”“… Odasaku?”“Yeah,” Chuuya agrees, smiling sweetly. “Odasaku.”Mori coughs as he stands up. “I think we should leave them to themselves, Kouyou-kun.”“I couldn’t agree more.”Dazai watches helplessly as the two adults leave before turning back to Chuuya who has dissolved into a fit of giggles.“Don’t be jealous, Dazai, I prefer you.”Dazai smirks. This sounds more like it, but –“I’m not jealous.”“Mm. And I hate to admit it but you’re really smart.”Dazai hums though he feels slightly miffed that Chuuya just ignored his claim of not being jealous.But you were totally awestruck when you saw me too.”“I was not.”“You tripped over thin air.”“A mere misstep.”“Hm.”Dazai sighs. It’s not like Chuuya will remember this later.“Fine, I thought you were really hot too.”Chuuya smiles in satisfaction and smirks.“Good,” he says before he grabs Dazai and yanks him in for a kiss.

28 year old Chuuya drops by with a message for 15 year old Chuuya [time travel] (Day 55)
Chapter Notes
A bit angsty. I know people don't really like angst but it's cathartic and I need it >.>



“Hello.”Chuuya looks up from his papers to see a figure standing at the entrance of his room. There’s no sound as the man approaches and Chuuya’s narrowed eyes slowly round in surprise when the older man steps into view.“It’s been a while.”The man has long hair tied into a high ponytail but there’s no mistaking those blue eyes (even if they do seem colder) and bright red hair. Chuuya is staring at an older version of himself – it can only be the work of an Ability. The question is why has he come looking for his younger self?The older him has nostalgia plain on his face and that’s all Chuuya needs to know that The Sheep isn’t going to last much longer.“Where did you come from?” Chuuya asks.The older man tilts his head and Chuuya’s not exactly a narcissist (fine, he is) but he has to admit that he has aged gracefully. Like, really gracefully.“The future.”Chuuya rolls his eyes.“Yes, clearly,” he says, “but what kind of future?”“You must already know if I’m here.”Yes, Chuuya has his doubts that the future the older him has come from is a bleak one. It’s not his mere presence that tells him that; it’s the pain that he carries in his heart and that is so clearly reflected in his fragmented blues. It seems like an endless sorrow plagues him and Chuuya really doesn’t want to know how or why he let himself end up in that state.“Chuuya,” the man starts before chuckling. “It’s weird calling my own name.”Chuuya shrugs. “It’s weird seeing you.”“True.”There’s a silence, one Chuuya recognises is his way of stalling for time because words construct reality and some realities are hard to face. Guess he’s still the same person after all. The older Chuuya coughs and looks away.“A few days from now, someone will come to recruit you and The Sheep into the Port Mafia.”“... That sounds like a good offer?”Older Chuuya laughs. “It is. That’s why I took it. But you – ” he turns to look at the King of The Sheep, eyes sharp and serious “ – you won’t do that. You’ll make Tachihara the leader, instruct him to accept and get out of the country tonight.”“Why?”“It’s the only way to save him.”“Besides the fact that I don’t even know who this him is, when have I ever cared for someone else so much that I’m willing to sacrifice everything I know?”“No, you haven’t, not yet, but you will. But trust me, doing this will be for your own sake.”“I don’t understand.”“I don’t have much time. Trust me, your men will thrive in the Port Mafia and they don’t need you. Don’t even meet the envoy.”“Why?”“You don’t need to know. All you need to do is trust yourself.”The older Chuuya smirks but before the younger one can say anything more, he disappears with the wind.

Dazai lets the satisfied smirk slip onto his lips for a fraction of a second as he spots his target sitting at the bar. The redhead laughs and presses bills into the bartender’s hands in exchange for a new drink. He drowns it in one shot and Dazai raises an eyebrow. From what he has heard, the King of the Sheep isn't exactly good with holding his liquor. Chuuya puts the glass down and heads over to the floor to start dancing, and Dazai might have stared for a second too long before he moves. The demon prodigy falls into step next to Chuuya and naturally eases into standing behind him, moving to the beat with him. Chuuya is surprisingly receptive as he presses his back against Dazai, even throwing a flirty smile over his shoulder.Dazai smirks when he feels the redhead's body stuttering against him. If his assumption is right, Chuuya has just been rudely informed about the kind of Ability he's up against. To Dazai's surprise, the smaller teen simply turns and places his arms around Dazai's neck as he leans in to him.“Has the Port Mafia finally come to seek me out?” he whispers against Dazai's ear.Dazai suppresses the shiver that threatens to break his indifference and smirks as he wraps arms around Chuuya's waist and brings him closer.“And so what if we have?”“Your Ability's impressive but not all of us only rely on our Ability.”Chuuya's lightning fast and Dazai has only just widened his eyes when he feels the press of steel against his neck. The change in atmosphere is immediate. The other partygoers whip out their guns and point them to Chuuya. The regular citizens panic and start to run out. Dazai lets them all leave before smirking at Chuuya.“Surprise,” he says even though he's a bit perturbed by how calm the redhead seems to be despite being surrounded by Port Mafia members who won't hesitate to shoot if Dazai gives the order to do so.Chuuya smiles at him, sugar sweet. “Thank you.” And then his smile drops. “You don't seriously think you can bring so many men into my turf without being noticed, right?”Dazai doesn't have to question what he means as the doors burst open and men from The Sheep surround them. He has to admit that he's impressed; not many people would have been prepared for an ambush like that. Dazai hasn't smelt alcohol on Chuuya's breath; the redhead already knew they were here from the moment they stepped into the club.“You're so cute,” Dazai says with a sigh as he pats Chuuya's head.He doesn't get to do it a second time as Chuuya catches his hand with an annoyed frowned.“Fuck off. And if you want to talk, do it properly.”“Sure thing, darling.”“WHAT THE HELL?”“You will be mine,” Dazai promises before he leaves.Chuuya splutters behind him and Dazai smiles. After all, his predictions are never wrong.

“ – Chuuya-kun, are you even listening to me?”Chuuya looks up at Mori with guilt in his eyes. Mori raises an eyebrow.“What's wrong?”Chuuya shakes his head. “It's nothing, boss. It's my personal affairs and I shouldn't bother you with this.”Chuuya's contradicting his statement with a pleading look in his eyes. It's not his fault; he needs to get this out of his system.Mori chuckles. “Do tell me what's bothering you, Chuuya-kun. I can't have my executive suffering now, can I?”“Dazai wants to marry me,” Chuuya blurts out and then promptly turns red as he buries his face in his hands. “Boss, help me.”Mori pauses. “Are you unsatisfied with the ring?”Chuuya stays still for a moment before he peers at Mori through his fingers. “... Excuse me?”“Well, I didn't think big, fancy diamonds were your type. I thought having the black diamond embedded into the ring was a really lovely idea, and it's meaningful too.”Chuuya can't actually believe he's hearing this but what he's more concerned about is – “Meaningful?”Mori stares at him pointedly. “Double Black?”“Ohhhh,” Chuuya says before he drops his hands and frowns at Mori. “You knew about this?”“Well, Dazai-kun came to ask my and Kouyou-kun's permission.”“... You said yes?”“Well, you're obviously in love with each other.”“...”“... Was I supposed to say no?”“But – ” Chuuya bites his lower lip. But there are so many problems. Yeah, sure, Fyodor is gone, and the Port Mafia and Agency still have their alliance but they're still essentially different companies and -“You think too much,” Mori interrupts. “Why not take the day off?”Chuuya nods. He wanders around the streets for a while and his feet take him to the Agency office. Figuring that he might as well talk to Dazai about it, Chuuya knocks on the door and walks in. He hears familiar whining and a smile unconsciously appears on his lips.“Kunikida-kunnnnn, what if he says no?”“Shut up. I've just spent one hour comforting you; you are not ruining my schedule further.”“But Kunikida-kun, this is painful! Atsushi-kun, I am dying! No, I don’t want to die actually! Ranpo-san, you know the answer, right? Tell me!! Chuuya should know how much I love him right?”“Why not just ask him yourself?” Ranpo asks.Dazai appears in front of Chuuya comically fast.“Chuuya!” he says as he hugs the executive tightly.Chuuya splutters as he tries to pry Dazai off him. He finally succeeds in throwing him to the ground and glares down at him. Dazai actually looks like he wants to cry.“Does this mean no?”“Well, you could have asked me instead of leaving the ring in my coffee cup,” Chuuya says with a roll of his eyes. Kunikida smacks his ideals book against his forehead.Dazai stands up and smiles at Chuuya brightly. He grabs Chuuya's hands and leans in close to the redhead.“Chuuya, will you marry me?”Chuuya laughs. “You already know my answer, bandaged bastard.”

The soft knock on the door is enough to rouse Chuuya from his sleep. He yawns softly, a hand covering his mouth, as he shuffles to his feet. He drapes his blanket over him and crosses from the living room over to the door. He glances at the clock on the wall and frowns when he sees that it's already two in the morning. Dazai had texted him that he was coming over almost six hours ago. No wonder Chuuya fell asleep while waiting for him. He opens the door.“Dazai, what's – ”He doesn't manage to finish his sentence as Dazai pulls him into a tight hug. Chuuya's eyes widen before they narrow in worry as he wraps his arms around Dazai's body. It isn’t like Dazai to be so open with his affections. The taller man shudders and breathes in harshly as he presses his face into Chuuya's hair – he’s crying. The fact that Chuuya has never seen Dazai shed tears before is enough to make him struggle out of the man's hold and pull him into the apartment.Chuuya leaves him on the couch and goes to the kitchen to make a cup of tea. Even if Dazai did seek him out of his own accord, Chuuya knows that Dazai still prefers to be alone in times of weakness, or at least until he manages to get his emotions under control. Dazai probably hadn't intended to start crying in front of Chuuya and the redhead can only wonder what had happened to make Dazai lose his composure.The answer comes to him as he thinks through the recent problems plaguing the Mafia. Mimic. Ango. Oda. Chuuya almost drops the teacup when he realises what this is about. He walks back into the living room, looking calmer than how he feels as he passes Dazai the tea. Dazai has gotten himself under control; he doesn't even look like he had been crying though Chuuya can see that his eyes are red rimmed. Dazai takes a sip of the tea before putting the cup down.Chuuya sighs as he leans against Dazai's chest. The other shifts so that he can put an arm around Chuuya. It's cold and Chuuya dropped the blanket in the doorway. He really should have thought to wear something more than just a shirt and boxers. He draws his legs up to his chest and Dazai chuckles.“Silly hat rack,” he says before moving away from Chuuya. He takes off his coat and dumps it over the smaller man before pulling Chuuya back to him.“He was a good man,” Chuuya says simply.Dazai pauses for a moment before letting out a laugh that bears no happiness and is laced with all the sadness in the world. It breaks Chuuya's heart.“He was.”There's a moment of silence before Dazai pulls away from Chuuya and stares at him in the eyes.“I can't lose you too.”Chuuya smiles at Dazai and hugs him tightly. “You won't.”

Chapter Summary
Chuuya has a question and Dazai is probably the worst person to ask. (Day 59)
Chapter Notes
Hurt/ comfort tending towards angst



“Oh my, what a lovely day! Oh no, is that a hat rack I see? Has the Port Mafia finally decided to unleash its most monstrous weapon onto the streets of Yokohama?!”Chuuya wishes he could feel the instinctive urge to shoot back at Dazai but all that comes out of his mouth is a sigh. At this time, he should say, Bandaged bastard, you're one to talk! Walking around the streets without a leash, can the Agency take responsibility for the trauma that you'll cause the citizens of Yokohama? Chuuya wants to laugh; such words just come to him so easily. He notices Dazai's goofy expression slipping away into a forlorn one – a genuine one – and makes space for Dazai to sit on the bench next to him. They spend the next few minutes in silence as they watch the people go about their lives in the park.“Chuuya,” Dazai finally says. “What's wrong?”“So direct. How unlike you. Ah, I'm not used to do. What do I do?”Dazai sighs through his nose, and Chuuya can see the lines of frustration in his face. It makes Chuuya want to smile but he can't.“Dazai.”The detective turns towards him slightly. “How do you do it?”“Do what?”Chuuya shrugs as he casts his eyes further out the park and onto the streets where the cars drive by. Dazai waits patiently for an answer.“Live.”Chuuya doesn't see the shock so much as feel it. Dazai isn't one to let emotions show up on his face; years of hiding his feelings is a habit that's hard to die. It’s just too bad for him that Chuuya knows him so well.“Chuuya, why – ”“Don't,” Chuuya interrupts. “Don't ask me why and don't ask me what's wrong. Just tell me how.”Dazai sighs again. He's being uncharacteristically open that day.“I found a reason to live,” Dazai says eventually. “I found reasons.”Chuuya hums before saying, “that's not what I mean.”There's a moment of silence in which Chuuya understands that Dazai hadn't misunderstood his question and that he had just been giving the wrong answer on purpose.“I don't know, Chuuya,” Dazai says eventually. “You just do it, one day at a time. Somehow, the world thinks you're still needed so you do what needs to be done.”Chuuya finally laughs. “How unlike you to say these things.”“How unlike you to ask me something like this.”Laughter falls from Chuuya's lips again. “Fair enough.” He glances over at Dazai and his breath catches when he sees the tender look directed at him. “Are you free?”“I only came out to harass you,” Dazai replies with a shrug.Chuuya rolls his eyes and scoffs before his eyes soften. “Can you do something with me?”“Anything you want, Chuuya.”“Can you...” Chuuya hesitates and he drops his gaze before steeling his nerves and looking straight into Dazai's eyes. “I really don't want to be alone tonight.”Dazai laughs. “Sure thing, Chuuya.”

        See the end of the chapter for more notes




“You selfish prick,” Chuuya mutters to the man lying in the coffin. “You fucking idiot. Killing yourself... what a way to go… and I was supposed to kill you too…” Chuuya inhales harshly as the name he hasn’t said in years slips past his lips, “Dazai.”Dazai doesn't retort with his usual aggravating remarks nor does he smirk in that way that Chuuya hates so much. Chuuya should be happy but all he feels is emptiness in his chest as if someone had dug his heart out. Lightning strikes across the sky and raindrops slam hard against the window. It's happening surprisingly soon.“You died to keep this world safe,” Chuuya mumbles before he leans down and presses his lips against Dazai's. The other man's lips are so cold. Chuuya smiles against them before he whispers, “I'll make sure you didn't die in vain,” and pulls away.“Chuuya-san, where are you going?”Chuuya presses a message into his subordinate’s hand.“Pass that to Ane-san tomorrow, yeah?”The man's eyes widen before he nods.“Don't open it before that.”“Yes, sir!”Chuuya smiles at him before he walks to his car. He slides into his seat and speeds down the stormy streets of Yokohaham, his mind already set on a particular destination. He rides the elevator up the apartment complex in silence and rings the doorbell of the house of the man whom Dazai had thought was worth dying for.Oda opens the door and a brief look of shock crosses his face before he invites Chuuya in.“Can I get you anything? Tea perhaps?” Oda asks, seeming quite at ease in the presence of an enemy.“No, thank you,” Chuuya replies as he takes a seat on the couch. He glances around the apartment. It's sparse and only holds the essentials. Chuuya had never been to Odasaku's apartment before but this feels like how Odasaku would arrange his house. Some things don’t change. “Dazai died. You heard, right?”A flash of an emotion akin to sorrow passes Oda's face. It couldn't have been actual sorrow because Oda doesn't know Dazai; Odasaku's the one who does. Chuuya allows a smile to grace his face as he sees the manuscript on the table.“Hey, do me a favour and keep writing, okay?”Oda frowns. “Why would you want me to do that?”Chuuya hums. “Because he wanted you to. Because it makes you happy.”“Wha – ”“I have to go,” Chuuya interrupts as he stands. “Be happy, Odasaku.”Oda looks shocked and confused, but Chuuya doesn't waste another second there as he drives back to the Port Mafia building. He enters the room where Dazai's coffin is kept and stands next to it.“You idiot. You didn't have to tell two of them, did you?”Dazai doesn't answer and Chuuya doesn't manage to get another word out as he starts to cough out blood. He slides down to the ground and sees the storm easing up. At least this world is safe now.



Chapter End Notes
If you're confused, don't worry. It's supposed to be confusing. But the basis is that this Chuuya knows what's happening in the other universes as well. Take it as a manifestation of his Ability.


Paper Dance
Chapter Summary
Dazai's model stood him up but luckily a dancer is free to help him out. (Day 61) [Artist AU]



Dazai's mood sours considerably as it starts to pour. How is he going to find a replacement now? He curses the model who had apparently forgotten about their scheduled session and resolves never to ask for her again. His phone rings and he picks it up in a hurry after seeing Oda's name.“Odasaku? Did you manage to find anyone?”“Not in this rain,” is his best friend's response and Dazai sighs. “Every model I know is busy today. I do have an option though.”“I'm all ears.”“I know you wanted an experienced female model but I have a male friend who's a dancer and he said that he wouldn't mind helping you out.”“Yeah, sure, why not?” Dazai’s working on a collection of art pieces for his latest art book and while he generally likes to follow his schedule he's quite flexible. Besides, dancers could hold poses for a long time anyway so it isn't as if he'll be working with a complete amateur. “When can he get here?”“I'm with him right now and I'll reach your studio in about ten minutes.”“See you, and thank him for me.”“Alright.”Only five minute have passed when someone knocks on the door. Dazai opens it to reveal a red haired man with the most beautiful eyes he has ever seen. He catches himself before he stares for too long and invites the dancer in.“Thank you for taking the time to do this,” Dazai replies. “I'm Dazai Osamu. Nice to meet you.”“Nakahara Chuuya,” the dancer replies with a smile as he shakes Dazai's hand. “And it's no problem. I've always wanted to do this. Is there any pose you want?”Dazai shakes his head. “Just show me what you've got.”“Okay.”Chuuya walks to the centre of the room and stretches for a while before he starts to strip. Dazai stares for a few seconds before he quickly turns around, flushing a deep red. What is the matter with him? He's a professional artist and he has never been this affected by any model before. And he works with nude models all the time; how is this any different?“I'm done.”Dazai turns around and can't help but stare a little at the expanse of pale skin on display in front of him. Chuuya has a really nice body as well, no doubt from his training.“What kind of dance do you do?” Dazai asks as he sits in front of his easel.“Contemporary,” Chuuya replies. “I also used to do ballet when I was younger.”“I see.”They spend the next few minutes deciding on Chuuya’s pose and by the end of three hours, Dazai's more than satisfied with his work.“So, I'm wondering if you would like to do this again?”Chuuya smiles at him brightly. “Sure. And would you like to get coffee sometime too?”Dazai splutters for a few seconds before he manages to get a 'yes' out. Chuuya just laughs in response.



Progress
Chapter Summary
Dazai's enamoured by the red haired customer that drops by the bakery every day. [Bakery AU] (Day 62)



Dazai sighs happily as the doors open and a redhead steps in. Atsushi laughs lightly while Ranpo just sighs.“Dazai-san, you should tell him that you like him,” Atsushi suggests in amusement as he watches Dazai follow Chuuya with his eyes and a dreamy look on his face.“What do you know, Atsushi-kun?”“Oh, please,” Kunikida says as he comes out from the kitchen. “Why are you trying to sound so mysterious when you're just an idiot with a huge crush? But I'd rather you not confess and scare our customers away.”“You're mean, Kunikida-kun!” Dazai whines loudly as he points a dramatic finger at his co-worker. He's about to go into a monologue about how Kunikida is a monster when crystal clear laughter distracts him. He turns around to smile at Chuuya. “Chuuya-san! Good morning!”“Morning, Dazai-san,” he replies before laughing, “is Kunikida-san bullying you again?”Kunikida interrupts before Dazai can say anything. “I don't anything of the sort. Don't listen to his lies, Chuuya-san. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do. The bread should be done in another 16.5 seconds...”Dazai pouts and sticks his tongue out at Kunikida as the man returns to the kitchen, though he quickly recovers and turns his attention back to Chuuya.“And I suppose you'll want a mocha to go with that?”“I must be so predictable,” Chuuya says jokingly as he sets the tray down.“You do get the same thing almost every day,” Dazai replies with a smile, already putting the bread in the microwave to heat it up without Chuuya even asking. Dazai collects payment from Chuuya and raises an eyebrow when he sees the book sticking out of Chuuya's bag. “You draw?”Chuuya spares a glance at the book before smiling. “It's a hobby. I'm actually a violinist.”“Like in the orchestra?” Atsushi asks with awe in his voice and Chuuya chuckles and replies affirmatively.“I actually have a concert this Friday and the tickets are all sold out but I have two extra tickets. So if maybe you'd like to go...” Chuuya trails off though he's looking at Dazai with meaning in his eyes.Dazai stares back at Chuuya, his mouth hanging agape and he doesn't even hear the sound of the microwave until Ranpo nudges him in the back roughly. Dazai splutters. “One minute,” he tells Chuuya before walking to get his bread. He places the mocha on the tray before returning to Chuuya.The redhead smiles at him though he looks nervous. “Well? I mean if you're busy, you don't have to – ”“I'll go!” Dazai blurts out, causing Ranpo to snigger. Dazai coughs as he shoves his hands into his pockets. “I mean, sure, I’m free. What time is it?”“Great!” Chuuya says, a pleased smile on his face. “It's at seven! Oh, could I get your number? I could text you the details later.”Dazai smiles as he writes his number down on a serviette.
This is a great day.




Oh Bother
Chapter Summary
Dazai isn't about to let Chuuya go home with some other samurai. [Edo Kabuki AU] (Day 63)
Chapter Notes
So we talked about kabuki in class today and let's just say that everything I've written is factually accurate lol.



Cheers and applauses erupt once the act comes to an end. Chuuya flashes Dazai a smile dirtier than the performance he had just put up before disappearing from the stage. Dazai grins and stands up though his mood quickly sours when he sees other, lesser samurais making their way to the group of actors standing by the stage.“Dazai, don't,” Oda says with a shake of his head. “You can't keep killing every night because of one actor.”Dazai tilts his head and raises an eyebrow; it'd be a challenge if he weren't talking to Oda. “And why not?”Ango interrupts Oda before he even opens his mouth.“Odasaku-san, why do you even bother?” Ango asks with a sigh as he rubs his temples. “Dazai-kun clearly knows the shogunate will be displeased yet he will still do as he sees fit. Why? Because that is the way he is. Now, my friend, how about we go for a drink instead? Unless, of course, you prefer to witness the chaos that Dazai-kun is about to bring upon this place. Again.”Dazai nods in approval at Ango's words before giving Oda a pointed look. The man opens and closes his mouth a few times before he sighs and gets to his feet.“I'll take you up on that offer, Ango.”“Wise choice.”Dazai laughs as he watches his two friends leave before he saunters over to the group of samurais who are making conversations with the actors in hopes of bringing one of them home that night. Dazai doesn't care about the other actors; as long as Chuuya leaves with him, the other samurais can choose whomever they want. Unfortunately, Chuuya also happens to be the most popular actor and there are already three men talking to him. For his part, Chuuya doesn't seem too concerned about the attention being lavished on him. Instead, he seems to relish in it as he laughs and replies with fluttering lashes. It makes Dazai's blood boil and he shoves the three men away.“I'll be the one taking him home tonight,” Dazai announces calmly, smirking at Chuuya who rolls his eyes at him.“You think too highly of yourself,” one of the men snarls before drawing his sword and lunging at Dazai.Dazai had been planning on letting them leave if they had just listened to him but as it is he makes quick work of the three of them before sheathing his sword and walking over to Chuuya who's wearing an unimpressed look on his face.“You keep killing samurais and the shogunate will ban us from performing, just like they did to the women.”“I'll take care of you if that happens,” Dazai replies flippantly and though he means it, he pretends like it's just a casual statement.Chuuya's eyes widen in surprise. “You mean it?”Dazai smirks at him. “Well, I'll tell you once we get back to my place.”Chuuya rolls his eyes even as he takes Dazai's hand.“You pig.”



Protection
Chapter Summary
Chuuya is surprised to find Kouyou at his door. (Day 64)
Chapter Notes
Takes place shortly after Chuuya joins the Port Mafia.



Chuuya stares around his new apartment. It’s luxurious and a nice upgrade from the flat he had been living in. Just one of the many perks of being a sub-executive of the Port Mafia, he guesses. Chuuya sighs as he opens a bottle of wine and pours it into the glass. The bell rings just as he takes a sip and Chuuya frowns as he stands up. He leaves the glass on the table as he goes to open the door.He sincerely hopes that it isn’t Dazai. It’s not that he doesn’t like the other despite his arrogant attitude and snarky tone and handsome face and perfect jaw and infuriatingly hot smirk and… Chuuya really doesn’t want to think about that. He pushes open the door and sad- fortunately, it’s Kouyou.“Kouyou-san,” Chuuya greets as he steps aside to let her in.Kouyou nods at him, her expression indiscernible. She’s carrying gifts with her – a vase of red flowers and a fancy paper bag – and she places them on the dining table.“I bought these for you,” Kouyou says as she tweaks the flowers’ position a bit before setting them in the centre of the table. “I figured your apartment could use some colours. I also brought some tea over.”“Thank you, but I prefer coffee actually,” Chuuya replies.To his surprise, Kouyou merely laughs as she takes the tea canisters out from the bag. They’re lacquered and decorated with pictures of birds and trees – clearly, they’re expensive. Kouyou also pulls a box out and retrieves two teacups from it. She sets about making the tea as if she’s at home. Instead of feeling as if his privacy is being invaded, Chuuya actually feels a sort of homely feeling. Once the cups are filled with tea, Kouyou gestures for Chuuya to take a seat opposite her.“You have an attitude; I like it,” Kouyou says.Chuuya takes a sip of the tea. It’s too hot and scalds his tongue but he doesn’t react, simply placing the cup back onto the table.“Is that a warning?”“You need to learn to distinguish between who’s genuinely being nice to you and who’s merely using you.”Chuuya takes an exaggerated look around his apartment. “You’re both showering me with nice things.”“At least you’re not entirely naïve,” Kouyou says with a laugh. “But only one of us showed up in person.”Chuuya purses his lips, not entirely sure where Kouyou is going with this. He knows she’s asking him to trust her but –“Why?”“You remind me of someone,” Kouyou says, a hint of emotion in her eyes.“Small, pathetic, weak?” Chuuya asks with a scoff.“You did the right thing when you chose your men over your pride.”Chuuya blinks, feeling a little shocked, watching wordlessly as Kouyou stands.“They’re kalanchoe,” she tosses over her shoulder before she leaves.Chuuya looks up the meaning of those flowers once she leaves.
Protection.
A smile slips onto his face, his wine tasting sweeter.



After All
Chapter Summary
Dazai returns to Yokohama after ten years. (Day 65)



Chuuya doesn't even know what to say. He only knows that he’s really happy that Dazai is right here, standing in front of him. A smile touches his lips and a tear slides down his cheek. How long has it been since he had smiled? How long has it been since he had shed tears, happy or otherwise?A soft smile graces Dazai's face as he steps over, cupping Chuuya’s cheek and wiping the stray tear away.“Fancy the Boss of the Port Mafia crying in public,” Dazai says in a gentle tone, a sweet breeze in the early morning, one that he only ever used behind closed doors.Chuuya laughs and grasps the hand touching his face. “It’s good to see you after so long, Dazai.”“It’s good to see you too,” Dazai replies, turning his hand around to hold Chuuya’s hand as they start walking down the promenade. They stroll in peace for a few moments, the five tall buildings in the distant looking over the port like guardian angels. Dazai turns to Chuuya, the corners of his eyes crinkling. “Yokohama hasn’t changed much, has it?”“I would like to think it’s less chaotic.”“Ah, it certainly is,” Dazai says with a laugh, sparing a short glance at Tokyo Bay where Moby Dick had once literally created quite a splash. “This is no doubt thanks to your leadership. And Kunikida-kun, of course. I shouldn't be biased.”“No, you shouldn’t be,” Chuuya says, squeezing Dazai’s hand a little. “Kunikida-san has been a great help and our alliance is so strong thanks to his cooperation.”“It takes two hands to clap,” Dazai replies.Chuuya pauses in his steps, and Dazai paces two steps forward before their linked hands stay him. He tosses a questioning glance over his shoulder.“Stay,” Chuuya whispers, looking at the ground and not at Dazai, almost as if he’s afraid of finding rejection in Dazai’s eyes. “Osamu, since you’re here, since you’ve come back after so long, stay. Take it as you’re doing it for me. You don't even have to come back to the Port Mafia – I’d never ask that of you but – ”Chuuya’s cut off as Dazai turns around and loops an arm around Chuuya’s waist while using the other to cup the back of his head and pull him into a kiss. It’s easy to melt into the kiss and Chuuya stands on his tiptoes as he throws his arms around Dazai. When they part, their eyes are both sparkling with a simple happiness.“Chuuya, why do you think I came back in the first place?”Chuuya laughs before it tones down into a smile. “Have you found something to do?”“I’m going to continue what I’ve been doing all these years.”“So, an editor then?”Dazai raises an amused eyebrow, and Chuuya’s face turns pink.“Someone has been keeping track of me, huh?”“Shut up.”Chuuya crosses his arms and walks away though he chuckles as Dazai whines and chases after him.



Nothing Can Keep Us Apart
Chapter Summary
It's tough having a long distance relationship but Chuuya and Dazai make it work. [AU] (Day 66)



“How are you?” Dazai asks.His voice alone brings a smile to Chuuya's lips and he can feel the stress from the week melting away. It's so wonderful to hear Dazai's voice next to his ear again after almost a week of not talking to the other man. University has been hectic and while Chuuya genuinely enjoys his classes, coming back to study for a masters after graduating for so long does take a toll on his brain.“I'm good,” Chuuya replies.“You sound tired,” Dazai says. “You need to take care of yourself, Chuuya. Are you resting well?”“I am,” Chuuya lies. “I'm just more tired today is all.”Dazai hums and it's clear he knows Chuuya isn't telling the truth but he lets it slide anyway. “So anything interesting happened this week?”Chuuya launches into recounting the amusing things that had happened in class and with his friends the past week. He gets distracted as he excitedly talk about his lessons and Dazai pays attention even though he has no idea what Chuuya's talking about.“Sorry, I'm rambling again,” Chuuya says. “We don't even have time these days and I spend our entire phone call talking about me only.”Dazai chuckles over the line, making Chuuya feel warm all over.“That's not true, silly. I get to talk too. And I love hearing you ramble about your classes.”“But you don't even understand what I'm saying.”“But I find it adorable when you get all excited.”“Shut up,” Chuuya says even though he's smiling so widely his face hurts. “How's work?”“Ah, the usual. Kunikida-kun is annoying but I know he means well.”“You're just slacking as usual,” Chuuya retorts.Dazai starts to whine and protest, saying how he managed to secure a deal for the company, one that even the boss thought was impossible.“Kunikida-kun even treated me to dinner ~ Like he actually put it in his schedule!”“Yes, yes, you're so great,” Chuuya deadpans even though he feels proud.They start talking about random things, letting time pass as they just enjoy each other's company. It's really nice to be able to talk to Dazai like this and it almost feels as if they haven't spent the last year apart. Chuuya had been worried that their relationship wasn't strong enough to sustain a long distance relationship but Dazai had waved his concerns off and as usual it turns out that Dazai is right. Still, Chuuya misses the feel of Dazai's hand in his and the warmth of waking up next to a body instead of cold sheets. He misses Dazai hugging him from the back as they cook together and he misses sleeping on Dazai's chest at night. The pillow just doesn't feel half as good.“One minute,” Chuuya says as his doorbell rings.He almost drops his phone when he opens the door and sees Dazai standing there with a mischievous grin on his face.“Miss me?”Chuuya responds by pulling him into a kiss.



I'll Take Care of You

Chapter Notes

        See the end of the chapter for  notes




Chuuya curls in on himself. His head feels like it's being cleaved down the middle and despite having his eyes closed for the past half an hour or so, sleep still doesn't seem inclined to claim him any time soon. Chuuya groans as he wraps the blanket tighter around himself and presses his head against his pillow, hoping to numb the pain somehow. In that state, he doesn't notice his bedroom door opening a little before being shut again.*Dazai heads around the corner to the nearest convenience store. He grabs a few bottles of water as well as some medication and medical supplies. He wonders if he should get food but decides that he would either cook or call for a delivery later. He grabs a piece of bread for the medicine though. Dazai pays before he heads back to Chuuya's apartment, openly letting himself in with a key this time instead of picking the lock like he did earlier. Soft groans reach his ears as he opens the bedroom door and he smiles fondly at the little lump huddled up on the bed.Dazai slides into the bed, causing Chuuya to jerk in surprise. Chuuya turns around, blinking bleary eyes open and gives what Dazai assumes is supposed to be an incredulous look. As it is, Chuuya just look like he's pouting at him."Aww, hat rack, are you feeling unwell?"Chuuya jabs him in the chest weakly and Dazai chuckles lightly even though he has to admit that he feels worried. Chuuya never gets sick, but this was to be expected since Chuuya's such a workaholic.Dazai gets an arm around his back and helps him into a sitting position. He grabs a bottled water and uncaps it before bringing it to Chuuya's lips."Ahn, Chuuya ~ open your mouth ~"Chuuya growls thought it comes out more like a mewl before he opens his mouth and lets Dazai feed him some water."You're probably dehydrated. Drink more," Dazai comments lightly as he notices Chuuya's cracked lips. "Have you eaten?"Chuuya shakes his head."Thought so."Dazai retrieves the melon bread and tears the packaging open. He has to convince Chuuya to take at least a few bites and he puts the leftover onto the bedside table before grabbing the medication and giving it to Chuuya."This is just a temporary fix," Dazai says. "I'll go to the hospital with you tomorrow."Chuuya nods, probably just too tired to argue. Once he takes the pills, Dazai gently places a cooling gel sheet over Chuuya's forehead. He leaves Chuuya alone in the bed as he disposes of the rubbish and stores the bread in a container. When he returns, Chuuya is blinking around the room."What's wrong?" Dazai asks as he slips under the covers.Chuuya doesn’t say anything as he pulls him down and snuggles into his chest before his breathing starts to even out. Dazai chuckles lightly as he amuses himself with playing with the silky red tresses.

A True Gentleman
Chapter Summary
Dazai waits for Chuuya at a fancy bar the redhead frequents. (Day 73)
Chapter Notes
Title and fic inspired by a drink I had today ~



This isn’t Dazai’s usual scene. He prefers bars in back alleys with laid back atmospheres, not classy ones situated in expensive hotels but – Dazai sighs – this is exactly where Chuuya will be. Sure enough, after his first glass of whiskey, the man he has been dying to see since a week ago walks in.“A glass of this for that customer,” Dazai says to the waiter as he points to the drink in the menu.It’s amusing to watch Chuuya’s eyes widen as he looks around and tries to figure out who has bought a drink for him. Dazai smiles and waves enthusiastically till Chuuya sees him. The redhead scoffs and rolls his eyes before picking his glass up and walks over to Dazai, taking a seat next to the detective.“Oh, Chuuya, did your hat become heavier? You look like you’re collapsing under its weight.”“Shut up, bandaged bastard,” Chuuya groans. “I’m exhausted.”He takes a sip of the drink and hums in appreciation. “It tastes good. What’s it called?”“A True Gentleman,” Dazai says sneakily as he slides a room key over to Chuuya.The redhead scoffs though he eventually chuckles. “A true gentleman indeed.”Dazai leans closer to Chuuya, laying a hand on his thigh and whispers into his ear, “you know I can make you feel good, Chuuya. Had a stressful week, didn’t you?”Chuuya eyes Dazai for a few minutes before sighing and leaning forward, resting his forehead against Dazai’s shoulder, a show of trust. Dazai reaches up to rub his back soothingly.“I’ve missed you,” Dazai confesses. To think that there’s someone in the world that he would actively want to see and also willing want to be with every minute. To think that that someone is Chuuya. But who else can it be? They had only met at 15 and had been separated for four years but there’s no one else Dazai would want to spend the rest of his life with.Chuuya pulls away and they spend next few minutes in silence as Chuuya finishes his drink. Without speaking, they stand up and head to the elevators. Once they’re inside the room, Chuuya throws himself into Dazai’s arms, finally letting up the tough act of the Port Mafia’s Executive.“It’s been such a fucking hard week,” he grounds out before whispering softly, “I’ve missed you too, you fucking waste of brain space. I fucking missed you so damn – ”Chuuya doesn't get to finish his sentence as Dazai presses his mouth against his. It’s not that Dazai doesn't want to let Chuuya complain; it’s that Dazai knows Chuuya needs this more than anything.It feels so good to lie on his back and let Dazai have his way with him as he fucks the tension out of his body. When Dazai collapses beside him, Chuuya curls up next to him and buries his face in Dazai’s neck, inhaling the familiar warm scent of the other man before he falls into a peaceful slumber.

Chapter Notes
Have more sick fic because my flu came back rip



Dazai scoops his baby boy in one arm and catches the falling pot with another, heaving a sigh but smiling as Asahi chuckles happily.“Now, how did you get here?” Dazai asks as he carries Asahi into his arms properly.He settles the pot back onto the stove before bringing Asahi back to the living room. He and Chuuya aren’t entirely sure what Asahi’s Ability is yet but their youngest is more often than not found floating around the house. Dazai places Asahi properly in place in his high chair and moves it into the kitchen so he can keep on an eye on his child while he cooks up some soup for Chuuya.“Papa, is lunch ready?”Dazai looks over to see his eldest son.“It should be done in a few minutes, Haru. How’s mama?”“Sleeping,” Haru answers before pulling a face. “Himari’s just slacking off and sleeping with mama.”Dazai laughs at that, knowing that his daughter would seize the chance to stay in bed. Chuuya had been exasperated when he realised that their only daughter would inherit Dazai’s laziness. Not to mention her Ability is telekinesis, which means that she doesn't need to walk to get anything. Dazai had been so jealous.“Well, go and wake them up,” Dazai says.Haru nods and leaves.When Dazai enters the bedroom later, he finds all three of his children huddled up on their bed with a sick Chuuya, and a smile immediately appears on his face. Haru probably brought Asahi in. Dazai leaves the tray of food on the table before sliding into bed next to Chuuya, putting an arm around his husband and smiling down at him.“How are you feeling?” Dazai asks.Chuuya sighs and turns his head into Dazai’s chest. “Terrible. And get these little creatures away from me before I pass my virus to them.”“You can’t pass your virus to me,” Haru says. His Ability grants him immunity from all sicknesses and poisons though Dazai and Chuuya aren’t entirely sure of the last one because they aren’t exactly eager to poison their son despite Mori’s assurance that he knows exactly how Haru’s Ability works.“Yes, but your sister and – ” Chuuya pouts, upset as always whenever he can’t hold his new-borns “ – your brother don’t share your Ability.”“Then I can stay here and they can leave,” Haru says.Dazai laughs. “Haru, be a good boy and bring your siblings out to have lunch. Papa will come out to feed Asahi after mama eats, okay?”The children leave without protest and Chuuya sighs.“I hate being sick.”“Then stop working so hard.”Chuuya grumbles but doesn't protest when Dazai feeds him his lunch. Dazai presses a kiss to Chuuya’s forehead after he tucks his husband back into bed.“I love you, Chuuya~”“You’re too sappy.” Chuuya turns around. “I love you too.”Dazai grins as he exits into the living, feeling grateful that this is the happiness he gets to wake up to every day.



Bet On Me
Chapter Summary
The detective sent to tail Chuuya is dorky but in a cute way.



Chuuya leans back against his chair, a smile dangling from his lips as he appreciates the scene opposite him. He’s careful not to be obvious about it, of course, pretending to be looking over his cards instead.The detective must be an amateur – Chuuya discovered his identity the moment he walked into the casino. This is too easy. Though Chuuya has to admit that he’s quite handsome.Chuuya wins the next round and the detective loses. The detective also doesn't have enough money to pay.Cute, Chuuya thinks before he clears his throat.“I’ll pay for him.”Chuuya slides his chips over before taking his winnings and leaving. Padded footsteps race after him and a smirk curves onto his face as someone taps his shoulder. He turns around to see the detective with a hesitant smile on his face. He’s also looming a few inches over Chuuya but Chuuya will forgive him because he’s cute.“Thanks,” the detective says.“Repay me by leaving, detective-san,” Chuuya replies and it’s amusing to watch shock settle on the man’s face before he laughs awkwardly and scratches the back of his head.“So you’ve realised, huh?”“No shit, Sherlock,” Chuuya says with a snort before turning though he halts in his steps at the detective’s next words.“Ah, that’s good, I was looking forward to having a chat with you, Nakahara-san.”Chuuya whirls around, a smile on his lips that speaks both of danger and warning. So this detective played him.“You should know better than to mess with me.”“It’s Dazai,” the detective says. “And I do know. After all, you’re directly linked to an Executive of the Port Mafia and rumours say that you’re also sleeping with the boss.”Chuuya smirks and sidles up next to Dazai, resting a hand on his thigh while the other rubs the back of his neck as he whispers into his ear, “would you like a taste of me then, Da-za-i?”For all that Dazai might try to remain indifferent, Chuuya can clearly feel him shiver. Chuuya pulls away before Dazai manages to say anything.Later, Chuuya’s wearing a bathrobe and sitting cross-legged on his bed when the detective enters with the room key he thought he had stolen from Chuuya. Of course, Chuuya had let him have it and he realises that as he slumps, the door falling shut behind him.“Well,” Chuuya says as he walks over, trailing a hand down Dazai’s chest, “since you’re already here…”Dazai pulls a face. “No, Chuuya, you are not going to do that.”Chuuya pouts. “Hey, I was just getting into the mood.”“You’re not going to sleep with the detective!”“Dazai! Keep in character! You’re supposed to help me practise!”Dazai scoffs, folding his arms. “You’re a natural, alright?”“Yeah,” Chuuya says as he stands on his tiptoes, his breath ghosting against Dazai’s lips, “so do I get my reward, Executive-san?”Dazai groans and grouses, “no sleeping with the detective,” before crashing his lips against Chuuya’s.



Beachside Romance
Chapter Summary
Dazai meets an interesting waiter on his vacation.



The waiter serves Dazai his cocktail but doesn't leave immediately. Instead, he folds his arms on the table and looks at Dazai with a calculating look in his eyes. Dazai raises an eyebrow, amused.“Yes, Chuuya?” he asks. They're not friends but Dazai has been at this beachside bar every night for the past two weeks and practically everyone already knows him by face. Chuuya had insisted to be called by his first name when he had introduced himself. In return, he drops the honorific from Dazai's name as well. Dazai can't say he minds it very much even though he generally hates this kind of disrespect.“Look, Dazai, I know you're hiding something.”Dazai laughs. He's hiding something; he's hiding many things. That's what naturally happens when you're the boss of the greatest crime syndicate in Japan but, somehow, Dazai doesn't think that that's what Chuuya's referring to.“And what is that?”“You're running away form something.”“Am I now?”“Well, I don't know, but you've been here every day for two weeks straight. Like, aren't you on holiday with friends or something? Why are you always alone?” Chuuya leans forward and drops his voice to a whisper, “or are you really on the run?”Dazai laughs. “I'm not. It's just rare that I can take time off work so I'm enjoying every minute I can.”It’s true; Oda and Ango can handle things in his absence.“Oh,” Chuuya says, sounding sad. “So that means you're leaving soon?”“Maybe in a week or so. Why? Are you going to miss me, slug?”“Shove off, mackerel. I can do without seeing your atrocious face every night!”Chuuya stalks off after that and Dazai chuckles to himself. If Chuuya doesn't want to see him, the redhead wouldn't be here every night. After all, he only works a five-day shift. Well, so maybe Dazai's more interested than he lets on.Later, as Dazai's taking a stroll by the sea, he spots Chuuya dancing at a party. With a smirk, Dazai casually joins the group and slides up behind Chuuya, boldly placing his hands on his hips and leaning forward to say into his ear in a low voice, “didn't know you could dance.”Chuuya turns around, breathtakingly beautiful, his eyes sparkling with light and life, as he throws his arms around Dazai with a smirk on his face. He steps closer to Dazai, tilting his head up and licking his lips slowly. Dazai follows that teasing tongue with lust in his eyes. This man is going to be the end of him.“I dance really well,” Chuuya replies and the invitation in his tone is clear.Dazai bends down to capture his lips and they end up in his bed in a tangled mess of limbs. In the morning, Dazai wakes up to a Chuuya with mussed up hair and shining eyes.“That was fun,” he tells Dazai, pressing a kiss to his cheek before leaving the room and Dazai wanting more.



A Good Model
Chapter Summary
Atsushi observes Dazai and Chuuya at work and learns more than he ever wants to. (Day 79) [Model/ Photographer AU]



“Are you excited for your first job, Atsushi-kun?”“Yes!” The new assistant photographer says enthusiastically. “I’ll be in your care, Dazai-san.”Dazai smiles at him. “You’ll be great, Atsushi-kun.”As they set up the camera and lighting equipment, Atsushi asks Dazai for some advice. He knows the basics and what to do, of course, but it still feels surreal that he’s actually on set and expected to help out with the actual photo shoot now.“Well, you’ll mostly be in charge of lighting today, but I’ll say that the most important thing is to establish rapport with the model. Sure, they’re professionals but I always find that I take the best photos when they’re the most natural,” Dazai says. He smiles and leans against the wall as he watches Atsushi. “You’ll be fine, Atsushi-kun. You’re friendly and easy to talk to.”Atsushi flushes at the compliment. “Thank you, Dazai-san! I’ll keep your words in mind.”“Chuuya-san has arrived and is doing his makeup now,” a man reports to Dazai and Atsushi frowns in concern when he sees the colour draining from Dazai’s face.“Dazai-san, are you alright?”Dazai smiles tersely. “I’m fine.”Atsushi leaves it at that though it quickly becomes apparent that there’s some sort of history between Dazai and Nakahara Chuuya. The moment the redhead enters the room and sees Dazai he scoffs loudly.“Seriously, mackerel? You?”Dazai rolls his eyes. “I’m not happy about this either, slug.”Nakahara doesn’t reply as he shrugs off his leather jacket. He’s wearing a ripped shirt and he smirks when Dazai glances at the patch of exposed skin near his hipbone before immediately looking away.“Do you need the air conditioning temperature to be lowered? You look really hot,” Nakahara says before licking his bottom lip slowly.Atsushi notices that Dazai follows the movement of Nakahara’s tongue before he comes back to himself with a short laugh.“Nah, don’t want you freezing to death in that outfit of yours.”“Aww, bandaged bastardi, didn’t know you cared.”“Oh, the amount of knowledge that evades you, hat rack~”As the photo shoot progresses, Atsushi can’t help but notice that despite the barbed insults the two throw at each other that there’s also an underlying sexual tension that’s so strong it makes being in the same room as them awkward. And he’s definitely not the only one who feels it because every other person is purposefully avoiding looking at either the photographer or model for too long.“This always happens,” someone complains softly and another laughs.“I wish they would just fuck already instead of torturing us all.”“Apparently, they used to date.”“Really? No way!”The photo shoot ends and Atsushi doesn’t miss the flirty smile that Nakahara shoots Dazai before he leaves the room nor does he miss the way Dazai’s eyes are glued to Nakahara’s ass until the door shuts behind him.“Atsushi-kun.”“Yes, Dazai-san?”“That was a very bad example.”
Yeah, I figured that out even without you saying anything… 




Once More
Chapter Summary
Dazai will always track Chuuya down. (Day 80)



The sun casts a fiery blaze over the sky, a meld of orange and red dyeing the once clear blue. Chuuya leans back in the beach chair, a fancy cocktail dangling from his loose grip and a content smile on his face as he watched the sun begin its descent into the waters. His smile turns into a grin as he feels someone approaching him. He doesn’t have to turn to know who it is.“Chuuya.”As usual, hearing his name fall from those lips sends a spike of warmth through him and briefly brings some pleasurable memories to the forefront of his mind but those are things that he dismisses easily as he cocks his head upwards.“Dazai, nice to see you again,” he greets as if it’s normal, coincidental meeting. “Took you rather long this time, didn’t it?”When Chuuya defected from the Port Mafia, he knew that Dazai would eventually track him down. And he has, countless times, but he had never once dragged Chuuya back to face punishment.“I still found you anyway,” Dazai says simply.“Because I sent you a message.”Dazai doesn’t say anything as he pulls an envelope from the inner pocket of his coat and tosses it to Chuuya. The redhead catches it easily, pulling the documents out and skimming through the information. Good, this is exactly what he needs. He places his drink on the ground and stands up as he stuffs the papers back into the envelope.“Thanks.”Chuuya hasn’t even completely turned away yet when Dazai grabs his wrist.“I ought to haul you back to Yokohama.”Chuuya shakes out of Dazai’s hold. It looks deceptively easy but that’s because he’s strong and no one, not even Dazai, can hold him down. That doesn’t mean he can’t try and Chuuya sighs in disdain at the red that marks his skin. He steps close to Dazai and tilts his head upwards as if poised for a kiss.“You could but you won’t.”Dazai opens his mouth and Chuuya crashes his mouth against Dazai’s, snaking his tongue in and moaning at the taste of familiar whiskey and spice. He instinctively throws his arms around Dazai’s neck as Dazai pulls him closer to him, his arms tight around the redhead’s waist as he presses desire, longing and possessiveness into the kiss. Chuuya breaks away and Dazai growls as he tries to capture his lips again. The redhead merely laughs and pushes Dazai away.“Because you won’t ever have that again otherwise,” Chuuya says simply.“I could have that and more,” Dazai retorts.Chuuya laughs at the threat. “You know that you wouldn’t enjoy that.”Dazai doesn’t respond but Chuuya knows that he has men located nearby, though not in this exact place, ready to take Chuuya down. He always does but he never mobilises them.“Well, I’ll see you around then, partner,” Chuuya says before he walks away, laughing as he feels a dark glare boring into the back of his head.



Planned
Chapter Summary
Chuuya's one night stand partner is more than a little hot. (Day 81)



Chuuya can feel Dazai’s eyes on him as he goes around the room, picking up stray clothing and tossing them into his luggage. He pauses and turns around. Dazai grins back at him shamelessly.“Up for a round?”Chuuya gives Dazai a disbelieving look before continuing with his packing. To tell the truth, Chuuya’s actually really tempted to say yes because, unfortunately, Dazai’s handsome face wasn’t a result of a drunken misjudgment. Chuuya had been half drunk and more than a little high when Dazai had started hitting on him at the bar the previous night.“Come on, Chuuya~”“No, I’m busy,” Chuuya retorts.“It’s Sunday,” Dazai whines.“It is,” Chuuya acknowledges but leaves it at that.He hears shuffling and turns around to find Dazai walking into the bathroom. The shower turns on and Chuuya wonders if it’d be rude of him to hightail it out of there. Is there some sort of one nightstand etiquette? If there were, he wouldn’t know since it’s his first time doing it. He hadn’t ever planned to but Dazai was… persuasive. Chuuya locks his luggage and sighs. Well, it isn’t as if they’re ever going to see each other again.Chuuya makes it halfway across the room when Dazai walks out in nothing but a towel. Dazai doesn’t have as good as a body as him but he’s still fit regardless and Chuuya finds himself staring at his abs. Dazai chuckles kindly as he takes in the situation.“How about I take you to lunch?”Chuuya should reject him. He needs to go home and he does have to prepare for work tomorrow. He had already decided to crash at a hotel instead of returning home after returning from Korea the previous night after all. Still, he agrees and finds himself conflicted. Dazai’s good in bed and he’s a charming conversationalist. Chuuya hates that he doesn’t want to say goodbye to the other man once they’ve left the restaurant.“Well, I’ll see you around, Chuuya,” Dazai says with a grin before he leaves.Chuuya stares after him with a frown. Sure, Yokohama isn’t that big but he doubts he’d randomly bump into Dazai again.On Monday morning, Chuuya waits inside his boss’ office as he wonders how his new partner is going to be like. The door opens and Chuuya stands up, bowing to Mori and freezing when he sees a familiar face.“Ah, Chuuya-kun, you’re already here,” Mori says pleasantly. “This is Dazai-kun. He’ll be your new partner. The department has high hopes for the both of you.”Mori sends them out afterwards and Chuuya’s still trying to wrap his mind around this situation when Dazai grins.“Fancy meeting you here, Chuuya~”“Did you know?” Chuuya demands angrily.“Well, I always did like to do my research, Inspector Nakahara,” Dazai says with a smirk. “Well, I’ll be in your care then, Chuuya~”Dazai walks off, and Chuuya resists the urge to take a boot off and throw it at his head.



The Bazaar
Chapter Summary
Dazai goes to the bazaar to look for help. (Day 82) [Sorcerer AU]



Even from such a distance away, Dazai can already hear the loud bustling of the bazaar and see the golden pointed tips of the red tents shining under the sunlight. It brings a smile to his lips. The city is dead and full of people with impassive faces and boring thoughts. The bazaar, located on the outskirts of the city, however, is brimming with life and energy. Dazai feels happier just walking towards it. He isn't there to shop – he doesn't have the time for such trivialities. Instead, he's there to look for someone, the only person who can help with the problem that he's facing.Dazai's assaulted by a splash of colour the moment he steps through the entrance of the bazaar as merchants shove their cloths and items into his face. He laughs and declines their offers as he pushes through the crowd. The bazaar's always so crowded, and Dazai lets the crowd push him along, knowing that the person he's looking for will find him eventually. As expected, a hand reaches out and pulls him away from the throng of people. Dazai simply lets the man drag him through the maze of tents before they enter one of them.“Chuuya~!” Dazai greets happily the moment the tent's flap falls shut behind them. “I've missed you.”Chuuya rolls his eyes and gestures to the table. Dazai takes a seat, amusing himself with picking out the new items in the tent while Chuuya prepares tea for them. The redhead slams a cup down before Dazai and raises an eyebrow. He cocks his hip to one side and places a hand on it.“So what do you want this time?”“So cold,” Dazai says with a sniff as he takes a sip of the tea.Chuuya rolls his eyes. “Spare me the dramatics. You only ever come to look for me when you need help.”“Because you told me not to come otherwise,” Dazai retorts. If he had his way, he would come looking for the redhead every day.Chuuya ignores him as he takes a seat opposite Dazai. “What do you want?”Dazai sighs through his nose before he starts recounting his story. People have been dying like flies do on a summer's day and even though the Agency suspected it to be some sort of crime syndicate or serial killer at first, they've eventually reached the conclusion that there were supernatural elements involved, which is why Dazai's here to look for Chuuya. The redhead's human but he hails from a family of sorcerers who have been dealing with everything from the likes of vampires to ghosts for centuries. Chuuya hums as he fiddles with his bracelet.“There has been some paranormal activity going on lately,” he affirms before smiling at Dazai. “I'll see what I can find out. Come back again tomorrow.”“You just want to see more of me,” Dazai says with a smug smirk.Chuuya laughs at that before he throws Dazai out.
What a tease.




Trash
Chapter Summary
Chuuya doesn't make typos in his reports. He does not. (Day 84)



Tachihara knocks on Chuuya's door and walks in apprehensively when Chuuya calls him in.“What is it, Michizou?”Tachihara pauses and tries to gauge the Executive's mood. He looks to be in a relatively good mood, but Tachihara can see that his smile is tensed, which means he probably wouldn't hesitate to throw his knives around. Tachihara sighs.“What's wrong?”Tachihara shakes his head, wisely saying nothing as he places the document in front of Chuuya.The redhead raises an eyebrow.“What is this?”“The document you gave me this morning.”“Uh-huh. What's wrong?”Tachihara drops his eyes to the document instead of replying.Chuuya frowns as he grabs the document. “Gods, Michizou, you have a mouth, don't you? How about using it when you need to? It's not as if I'm going to have your tongue pulled out if you say anything,” Chuuya grumbles though he stops short as he reads the words on the piece of paper.“Yeah,” Tachihara says.Chuuya smiles at him sweetly. It's the kind of smile he reserves for his worst enemies or Dazai. Tachihara takes a step back.“Ah, Michizou, how can you make such a mistake?” Chuuya asks.Tachihara frowns. “What? I didn't - “Chuuya drops his smile and glares. He stands up and raises the document. It looks like he's about to throw it at Tachihara but he simply sits down again and places the folder on his table.“No. I didn't write this.”Tachihara snorts. He walks over and decides to get straight to the point. He points to a paragraph.“Should I get rid of this?”Chuuya's eyes drop down to the paper.
Waste of bandages. Why don't you just eat shit and choke on it? I hope you get eaten by a whale while trying to drown yourself. Live in there forever, you nauseating colossal waste of space. You think you're so smart? You probably suffer from brain damage. I want to shove you into a rocket and deport you back to your planet, you disgusting mackerel alien. 
Chuuya looks back up to Tachihara, looking way too righteous considering the situation.“I didn't type this.”Tachihara looks over to Chuuya's laptop screen pointedly. The Executive glances over.
Bandage bastard. You should be shipped back to Egypt and buried a thousand feet below the ground. I'll move the heaviest metal in existence and seal the entrance of your pyramid with it. Stay there forever. 
Chuuya looks up at Tachihara before he starts typing on his laptop.“Edit it.”“But I need – ”Tachihara shuts up as Chuuya tosses a flash drive at him. It hits him in the stomach and sends him crashing to the ground.“GET OUT AND GET IT DONE.”“YES, CHUUYA-SAN!”Chuuya lets out a shout and Tachihara doesn't even look back to see what's going on as he makes a run for his life. As he closes the door behind him, he hears several vases meeting their end and shudders because that could have easily been him.



Get Away
Chapter Summary
They leave Japan once a year together. (Day 86)



It's sad to think that this will all be over, left to be nothing more than just a distant memory as time passes, in just a few hours. Still, Chuuya can't find it in himself to wake Dazai up. Maybe it's because he wants to imprint this moment into the depths of his mind, one that he can look back on and pretend that there was some sense of normalcy that existed between them even for just a second. Or maybe it's because he can't bear to tell Dazai goodbye when the time comes. Or maybe it's just because words had always seemed so redundant when it comes to Dazai. Regardless of what it is or what he wants, Dazai stirs awake a few minutes later. He smiles when he sees Chuuya staring at him.“Aren't you tired, hat rack?” Dazai asks teasingly as he reaches over to brush the edge of Chuuya's hat.Chuuya scoffs and pulls away slightly. “It's not even that long a flight, bandaged bastard.”Dazai hums as he threads their fingers together. It's such a sentimental thing to do, and Chuuya doesn't like it but he lets Dazai do what he wants. These short getaways are as much about him as they are about Chuuya.“So what are you planning to do once we get back to Japan?” Chuuya asks.Dazai shrugs. “I'll find something to do. Don't you worry your pretty little head off about me~”Chuuya slaps him in the arm for that comment but doesn't say anything. It's not as if he doesn't know what Dazai gets up to nowadays. The man is more often than not dead drunk in some bar or another. It looks like he's just wasting his life away but Chuuya knows there's more to it than that. After all, there's no way that Dazai left the Mafia after Oda's death just to be a full-time drunkard. Dazai seems to be waiting for the right moment to do something though Chuuya doesn't know what that something is, and he also knows better than to ask. They're not even supposed to see each other. Dazai’s a traitor and should be executed. But Chuuya had not so accidentally stumbled upon Dazai one day and they had just decided that going overseas to escape Japan together once a year was a reasonable thing to do. It has been four years now.“Chuuya, I actually have something to do this time but I don't know if you'll like it,” Dazai says softly.Chuuya shrugs. “I don't actually care.”
As long as you stay safe.
Dazai laughs. “Of course you don't.”“Hm.”“Chuuya, I might not be able to do this again next year.”Chuuya swallows a lump in his throat. “Okay.”Once they're allowed to leave the plane, Chuuya slips his hand out of Dazai's and doesn't look back as he walks away from Dazai even though he knows that this might be the last time he ever sees the man again.



You Know Nothing
Chapter Summary
Dazai meets a Wildling after getting separated from his group. (Day 88) [GoT AU]



Dazai sighs as he looks around him. Everything is white, and the Wall is nowhere in sight. He had gotten separated from his group about two days ago and he hopes that they have made it back to Castle Black at least. Movement catches his attention, and Dazai tenses, stilling as his eyes dart around. He hears the tell-tale sound of an arrow being pulled back in a bow and whirls around to find the tip of an arrow directed at his forehead. His breath catches in his throat as he sees blue eyes, sparkling and bright with life, unlike those frozen over ones the White Walkers possess. The man also has fiery red hair. He's breath-taking, and Dazai only remembers to breathe when the man growls at him.“What are you doing out here, Crow?”“Crow?” Dazai asks before frowning. “You're a Wildling.”The man snarls and steps forward. Dazai backs away as the arrow tip almost touches his forehead.“I don't like being called a Wildling.”“I don't like being called a Crow,” Dazai retorts.The man raises an eyebrow. “You're in my territory now, aren't you? Tell me why I shouldn't just end your life.”Dazai sighs and drops to one knee, startling the redhead as he jumps backwards. He glances down at Dazai, suspicion in his eyes.“My name is Dazai Osamu, and it's a pity that taking the black means never bedding a woman again, but you're beautiful, so could I please have the honour of committing a double suicide with you?”The man stares at him for a few moments before his mouths drops. He lets the arrow down, holding the bow limply by his side. “HAH? Are you fucking kidding me? What's up with all those bandages anyway? Are you trying to camouflage yourself in the snow?”Dazai pouts. “Is that a yes or no?”“It's a go fuck yourself, you bandaged bastard!”Dazai scoffs and gets to his feet, dusting the snow off his pants. “Bandaged bastard? What about that atrocious hat of yours, hat rack? I've never seen any Wildling with such an ugly hat.”“And you've seen a lot of Wildlings before, I bet,” the redhead says with a roll of his eyes. He draws his arrow again. “Don't make fun of my hat.”“Yes, sir. Or you got a name?”“Chuuya,” the man says with a shrug. “Well, you better find your way home then, stray crow?”Dazai raises an eyebrow. “Are you seriously letting me go? Is there an ambush somewhere?”Chuuya shrugs. “I just feel like doing something nice.” He pauses. “You don't remember me, do you, Dazai?”Dazai pauses as he stares at Chuuya. With those striking eyes and fiery hair, Dazai is sure that he would remember it if he had ever met Chuuya before.“What are you talking about?”“You do know nothing after all,” Chuuya says with a smile before he walks away, leaving Dazai with a thousand questions swirling in his mind.



Loosen Up, Have Some Fun
Chapter Summary
Dazai thinks he's a failure as a Slytherin. (Day 89) [Harry Potter AU]



“I'm a failure as a Slytherin,” Dazai announces gravely to his friends as they sit around a table with butterbeers in their hands.Ango gives a sigh and nods. “As a fellow Slytherin, I can empathise.”Oda frowns as he looks at the yellow of his uniform. He's pretty sure they're talking about the fact that they're friends with him, but why are they picking on him all of a sudden?Dazai eyes his friend.“Tell me the truth, Odasaku. You were supposed to be sorted in Slytherin but you asked to be placed in Hufflepuff, didn't you?”Oda shakes his head. “It was a definite Hufflepuff. I thought you'd be in Ravenclaw though, Dazai.”“Hm. I told the sorting hat as much. It laughed and put me in Slytherin.”Ango snorts. “Are we supposed to be surprised?”“Yeah, yeah, you're a true Slytherin all right.”The doors to The Three Broomsticks open, and Dazai lights up. He makes his way to the group of newcomers so fast that Ango rolls his eyes.“Don't worry, Odasaku. That's the reason why Dazai thinks he's a failure as a Slytherin.”Oda takes one look at Nakahara Chuuya, the seeker of the Gryffindor team, and nods in complete understanding.“Hat rack~” Dazai coos happily. “Have you come to terrorise the lovely citizens of Hogsmeade with that atrocity on your head? Also, I’ve recently realised something. You must have dwarf blood or something! That's why you're so short!”“You bandaged bastard,” Chuuya snarls. “What blood do you have then? Troll?”Dazai pouts. “Have you ever seen any troll with such a handsome face before?”Chuuya gives him a face of disgust. “I've seen trolls who are better looking than you.”“Liar~ You Gryffindors are such liars~”“Leave my house out of this!” Chuuya snaps. He turns to his friends in annoyance. “Help me out!”“We have no wish to get in the way of your lovers' spat,” Kunikida says with a roll of his eyes.Chuuya splutters.“Please just kiss him already so we can get our butterbeers.”“Kouyou!” Chuuya shrieks at his sister from Ravenclaw. “What are you talking about?”“Oh, come on,” Higuchi groans. “Everyone knows you guys made out after the Yule Ball last year.”“WE DID NOT!”“See~ liar~”“DAZAI, SHUT THE FUCK UP.”Chuuya lets out a frustrated shout before he storms out of the place. His friends sigh as they look after him. Kouyou raises an eyebrow at Dazai.“Why can't you just ask him out normally? You know he's too hot-headed for such games.”Dazai laughs. “Where's the fun in that? Well, if you would excuse me.”Before Dazai leaves, he grabs two bottles of butterbeers. He finds Chuuya sitting by himself while kicking at the snow and smiles. He sits next to him and passes the butterbeer to him.“So, you were amazing during your last match.”Chuuya just huffs before he takes his drink.“I want chocolates after this.”Dazai grins. “Anything you want, Chuuya.”



Music Strings
Chapter Summary
Dazai loses his way in his new music school. (Day 90) [Music School AU]



Dazai doesn't want to admit it but he's totally and utterly lost. He knows that the school is large but he hadn't expected it to be large enough to get lost in. But maybe he shouldn't have wandered off on his own. Oh well. Dazai hums to himself as he continues down the corridor and makes a turn into a new one. A grin appears on his face when he steps into a foyer.“There should be a map somewhere,” he mutters to himself as he walks around the place.Just as Dazai approaches the map, he hears a sound in the distance. He pauses for a while and strains his ears as he attempts to pick up the sound. It just sounds like a buzz from the foyer, so Dazai abandons looking at the map to pursue the source of the sound instead. As he follows it, it becomes clear that it's someone singing. Whoever it is has a beautiful voice, and Dazai finds himself enchanted from the pleasant tone alone. He stops in front of an auditorium that has its door left ajar and peeks into the room.There, standing in the centre of the stage is a red haired man wearing a hat. He's the singer, and the hat casts most of his face in the shadows, but there's a commanding aura surrounding him that captivates Dazai. The new student glances around the hallway and makes sure that it's empty before sneaking into the auditorium. The redhead doesn't seem to notice him as he continues with his song. However, when he's done, he tilts his head upwards and smirks at Dazai.“Enjoyed my performance?”Dazai's speechless because it's completely unfair that a man with such a good voice can have such stunning looks as well. The man's smirk just becomes wider as he folds his arms.“Nakahara Chuuya. I'm a second year singing student.”“Dazai Osamu,” Dazai replies immediately because staying silent any longer would make him look like an idiot. “I'm a new student. Piano.”“Cool,” Chuuya says as he jumps off the stage, landing perfectly and silently on his feet. He begins climbing up the stairs to where Dazai's sitting. “So I'm looking for a piano student to help with my recital that's coming up soon. Are you interested?”Dazai raises an eyebrow. “You haven't heard me play. How do you know if I'm any good?”Chuuya scoffs. “If you're here, you have to be good. Besides, there's a reason why I specifically want you.”Dazai folds his arms, leaning back in his seat as Chuuya approaches him. “And what reason is that?”Chuuya doesn't answer immediately. He takes a seat next to Dazai and stares at him long enough to make him uncomfortable. Chuuya lifts a hand and crooks his finger, beckoning Dazai to come closer.“Your face,” he whispers.Dazai freezes, only looking up when he hears Chuuya laughing. The man is already at the door.“Consider it, Dazai-kun,” he says before leaving.

Chapter Notes

        See the end of the chapter for  notes




Dazai smirks when he hears the tell-tale sign of concrete breaking. The men standing guard over him glance at each other, confusion in their eyes. That confusion will soon turn into fear - Dazai has seen it happen way too many times. Men start screaming from outside, and the two guards put down their guns as they approach the door. Soon, all screaming stops and silence seeps into the room. A harsh pound on the door sends the two men backing away from it. They draw their guns and aim it at the door. Dazai frowns when the door isn't immediately blown off its hinges. To be honest, that's his favourite part. Why is Chuuya being mean and deriving him of it?A low chuckle sounds through the door, and the guards cock their guns.“Tell me, mother-fucking piece of trash whose value is worth less than the bandages wrapped around you, why should I rescue you?”Dazai pouts. That is so not in the script.“Chuuya~~” he whines before adding more affection to his voice, “hat rack~”Chuuya growls in warning.“It's because we're partners!”“And if you die, we won't have to be partners anymore.”“... True.”“... THAT'S ALL YOU CAN SAY?”“Well, Chuuya, you made a perfectly reasonable deduction that requires no refutation. Why are you getting angry over being right for once?”The doors burst open, and Dazai lets the chains drop from his wrists to clap loudly.“Chuuya! Wow! That’s so cool!”The two guards pause for a moment, but they eventually decide that Chuuya is the bigger threat as they open fire on him. The bullets stop a mere inch from Chuuya's face as he raises his hand; Chuuya always did like to show off. The bullets clatter to the ground harmlessly, and fear takes over the men when Chuuya flashes them a feral smile. They unload all their bullets on him, and Chuuya simply stops all the bullets with a raised hand. With his free hand, he throws two knives consecutively, and the two men drop dead to ground.Dazai starts to clap again.“Amazing! Simply brilliant! This is why – ”Dazai stops short as Chuuya flicks his hand and all the bullets turn to face him.“... Chuuya?”“Give me one good reason why I shouldn't let all these bullets pierce through your pathetic body right now?”“... Because Boss will see that as treason and you'll be executed and even Ane-san won’t be able to save you?”Chuuya growls, and Dazai raises both hands up in surrender.“Okay, okay, that's a bad reason.” Dazai smiles softly. “Because we're partners.”“If you die, we won't be.”“Yeah, that's exactly why.”Dazai wants to laugh seeing the conflict on Chuuya's face, but he holds it in anyway, though why he bothers is beyond him since Chuuya probably knows that he finds this amusing anyway. In the end, Chuuya just rolls his eyes and lets the bullets fall.“Well, let's get out of here, partner.”“Whatever you say, partner.”

Close Shave
Chapter Summary
Dazai tries to save Chuuya. (Day 92) [Scholar AU]



“Stop!” Dazai shouts as he jumps in front of the group of bandits. They stare at him with hard eyes, clearly not impressed. Dazai scoffs, tilting his head up as he folds his arms. “You band of misfits! Release the hostage!”Annoyingly but expectedly, the bandits begin to laugh. The leader points his sword at Dazai as his laughter dies down.“And who are you to get in our way?”“I will not stand for this kidnapping,” Dazai says, sounding more confident than he actually is. He might be holding a fancy sword that might or might not belong to him and that he might or might not know how to use and sounding like a brave, experienced swordsman, but the truth is he doesn't actually know how to fight. Still, he says, “Release the hostage.”“Or else what?” the leader snarls.Dazai points the sword at them as he narrows his eyes. “Or I kill all of you.”The leader smirks. “Men, get him!”“Wait!” Dazai yells before the men even move. “Are you sure you want to fight me? Do you even know who you've kidnapped?”“The marquis' son, and so what?”“And you think you can take him away without any repercussions?”The bandits all start to laugh again. The leader shakes his head.“Does it look like we care about that? We either get our money or the marquis can have his head. And, well, he's a pretty boy too, so we might have some fun before chopping his pretty head off.”“Watch it,” Dazai snarls, wishing more than ever he had learnt to fight if only to kill this insolent scoundrel.“Men, get him,” the leader snaps.This time, his followers move before Dazai manages to say anything. Dazai sighs silently and thinks that he might as well die trying to save the nobleman. It's for a good cause if nothing else. He raises his sword, prepared to strike, when the sound of wood breaking catches his and the bandits' attention. The nobleman breaks out of the carriage. He had broken free of his restraints and he delivers a swift kick to the man standing nearest to him before snatching his sword. He slashes anyone who stands in his path as he makes his way to Dazai who's more than a little stunned at Chuuya's beauty and also skill. So, yes, he's kind of a creep for longing after Chuuya for so long despite only being a poor scholar who hasn't even taken the national exams yet. He had wanted to prove himself by saving Chuuya, but it looks like Chuuya has it all under control.“Are you okay?” Chuuya asks.Dazai nods mutely. Chuuya smirks before he's off again. After taking down a few more men, including the leader, the rest of the bandits flee.“You're amazing,” Dazai breathes out.Chuuya laughs. “You're not too bad yourself, scholar boy.”Dazai flushes as he realises that Chuuya recognises him.“Well, let's go home,” Chuuya says.



It's the Wine
Chapter Summary
Chuuya finds himself in a hotel room in the morning. (Day 93)



Chuuya's phone rings, and he groans as he reaches for it blindly. He grabs it off the bedside table and fumbles with it, pressing what he hopes is the answer button.“Hello,” he mumbles.“Chuuya, where are you? It's almost ten, and it's not like you to be so late for work.”Chuuya frowns. “Ane-san? Wha... I'm...” Chuuya trails off as his eyes snap open. He takes in the unfamiliar surroundings, and his mouth falls open. His shock only increases when he realises that Dazai Osamu is sleeping next to him in the hotel room. He closes his eyes, cursing himself internally.“Chuuya? Chuuya, are you still there?”“Yes, Ane-san, I, erm – ” he frowns when Dazai begins to stir from his sleep. When the other man lets out a groan, Chuuya says in a rush, “I'll be there soon. Goodbye.”He hangs up on Kouyou calling his name and glares as Dazai opens his eyes. A lazy grin appears on the detective face.“Morning, Chuuya, did you sleep well?”Chuuya smiles at him sweetly before kicking him right off the bed. Dazai lands on the ground with a huff, and Chuuya wraps the blanket around himself as he heads to the bathroom. He hears Dazai wailing outside but tunes the man out as he gets into the shower. He racks his brain as he wonders how he ended up in this situation. There was a meeting with the Agency the previous night. He had gone alone and was supposed to meet with Kunikida, but he had entered the restaurant only to find that Kunikida had brought Dazai along too. The meeting had taken longer than usual because Dazai is annoying and likes to talk way too much about things that have nothing to do with the meeting. Kunikida had left. Dazai had persuaded him to go to a bar... they served nice wine... Dazai and he started kissing and then they entered a cab... Chuuya leans his forehead against the wall as he sighs.“Nakahara Chuuya, why do you always end up doing dumb things when you're drunk?”He finishes his shower and dries himself off before slipping into a bathrobe. Dazai's wearing an identical bathrobe and lounging in the bed with his phone in a hand when Chuuya enters the room.“You can take a shower now,” Chuuya tells him as he dries his hand.Dazai pouts and hops off the bed before he saunters over to where Chuuya is picking his clothes off the floor.“Chuuya, why are you being so unfriendly? After what we did last night, we should be closer now.”Chuuya pauses and eyes Dazai. “That was the wine. It wasn't me.”“You seemed to like it though,” Dazai says with a smirk.Chuuya resists the urge to punch him in the face.“Get lost. I want to change.”“Nothing I haven't seen.”“You bastard!”“Call me after work today and I'll leave.”“Fine!”Chuuya rolls his eyes as Dazai chuckles and enters the bathroom.



Tell Me Why
Chapter Summary
Why the hell is Dazai working in the same centre as him? (Day 94) [Centre AU]



Dazai Osamu has only joined the centre for a week and he's already making Chuuya's life utter hell. The redhead groans and buries his face in his arms, wondering what the hell possessed Fukuzawa to employ someone as annoying as Dazai Osamu. Yes, the centre has a vacancy for photography, and, yes, Dazai used to be a professional photographer, BUT there are so many ex-professional photographers in the world, so why did Fukuzawa have to choose him? Chuuya lets out another groan.“Chuuya, are you alright? Do you want to take the rest of the day off? You only have one class left anyway, right?”Chuuya lifts his head to see Tachihara looking down at him in concern. The redhead sits up properly and shakes his head.“No, I'm not going home. I'm not going to be defeated by Dazai Osamu.”“… What are you talking about?”“Besides, my students will cry if they miss even one minute of my awesome flower arrangement lessons.”“Uh-huh.”A few female instructors walk past their table as they giggle.“Dazai-sensei is so hot.”“Yes, he really is.”“A professional photographer? More like a model!”“Exactly. Where does he get those looks from?”“By trading his soul with the devil,” Chuuya mutters in annoyance. He almost jumps out of his skin when a hand clasps onto his shoulder from behind as someone laughs loudly. He turns around to see Dazai and glares heatedly. “Get your fucking hands off me, mackerel.”“Aww, hat rack~ so you do think I'm good looking?”“HAH? When did I ever…” Chuuya trails off as his words come back to him and he realises how they could have been interpreted. “I meant that your personality sucks as much as your looks.”“Wow, I must have an awesome personality then.”“In your fucking dreams, fish brains.”“Chuuya~” Dazai whines as he begins tugging on Chuuya's arm. “Why are you so mean to me? We haven't met in, what, six years? And you've been nothing but mean to me ever since I started working here.”“So why are you still working here?” Chuuya asks, raising an eyebrow.“Well, a man needs to eat,” Dazai retorts easily. “And I enjoy teaching.”“Go back to being a photographer.”“Teaching is my new passion.”“Fuck off.”“Ah, that would have been nice to hear instead of you just upping and moving away all those years ago.”Chuuya freezes, acutely aware that Tachihara has been listening in to their conversation this whole time.“Well, Chuuya, so why did you break up with me without saying anything and just moved away like that?”Tachihara's mouth drops open and Chuuya wants to strangle Dazai. Instead, he settles for glaring at him.“What concern is it of yours? I broke up with you because I didn't like you enough, that's it.”Dazai hums. “Yeah, I don't think so. I'll give you a few days so tell me why, okay?”Dazai turns and leaves, and Chuuya stares after him in annoyance.



Absolutely Wrecked
Chapter Summary
Absolutely wrecked. That’s how Chuuya feels at that exact moment and it sucks. (Chapter 95)



Absolutely wrecked. That’s how Chuuya feels at that exact moment and it sucks. Just that. It plain sucks and dedicating a plethora of words to describe how low he is feeling is just doing injustice to how that feeling simply sucks. He exhales the cigarette smoke slowly, watching in morbid fascination as the grey smoke curls up and dissipates into the morning air; it reminds him of ashes being scattered in the wind, the end of life, the end of things.A man rushes in and bows slightly but he’s cut off before he even opens his mouth when Chuuya starts laughing, an empty sound.“Hiro-kun, we are at war. Dispense with all those unnecessary greetings.”Hiro hesitates before nodding. “Chuuya-san, we’ve recaptured Zone E.”It’s good news, considering Zone E is critical in launching their counter offence, but all Chuuya feels is a sense of hopelessness and sorrow that weigh his heart down.“Good job,” he says anyway, “let the others know.”It’s a cause for celebration after all. Losing Zone E means the Rats would be disabled for the rest of the night. A short respite for the men to catch their breath and boost their morals is understandable.Hiro nods and scurries away. Chuuya hears him telling the news to people in the hallway and scoffs when he hears genuine laughter. It’s a beautiful sound, but Chuuya’s too distracted by the fact that recapturing Zone E means that Tachihara is dead. It isn’t as if he hadn’t known about it. That had been Dazai’s plan after all – ask Tachihara to lead a team to attack Zone E, but they were just baits meant to distract the Rats while Gin carried out the real attack. Whether Gin succeeded or not, Tachihara and his men were doomed from the start, so at least Gin’s success meant that the men did not die in vain. Tachihara had known that he was going to die and yet he still wanted to go.
“They won’t be fooled if you don’t let someone close to you go, Chuuya-san.”
He had said that with a smile. Chuuya wanted to punch him. He still does.Footsteps alert him to Dazai’s presence, and Chuuya stiffens when arms wrap around him, Dazai resting his chin on Chuuya’s shoulder.“The plan was a success.”“It was.”Dazai sighs. “You’re angry with me.”“You sacrificed him.”“You know that sacrifices are needed.”“Then why aren’t you sacrificing your men? We’ve lost Hirotsu, Higuchi, Tachihara, and so many more.” Chuuya pulls away and shoves Dazai in the chest harshly. “Why haven’t anyone from the Agency died?”Dazai’s eyes harden. “It’s not like that. I chose the best people for the jobs.”Chuuya glares, prepared to unleash his fury on Dazai, but then he slumps; it’s not worth it.“I won’t make it through this,” Chuuya tells Dazai.“What are you – ”“Even if my body survives, I’ll be gone,” Chuuya says simply.“Chuuya…”The redhead doesn't respond as he walks away.



Well
Chapter Summary
Chuuya's angry. (Day 96)
Chapter Notes
I'm experimenting with a more introspective style of writing. Also, to everyone who comments, I read the comments every day, and they make me really happy. I apologise I haven't been replying but I'll get to them as soon as school settles down. Thank you for still being here and reading everything <3



Chuuya absolutely loathes it when someone, anyone, comes up to him and starts talking about everything from their point of view without realising that there things such as diversity. Sure, he’s in the Mafia and he’s an Executive so he’s as bad as they come, but that doesn't mean that whatever he does has to be automatically wrong or oh-so-appalling.If everything were painted in the black and white of morals, sure, he’ll admit that he falls into the dark side of the world, if only because morals are defined by society and are hence a social construct and not innate human behaviour. Of course he knows some things like killing someone is bad, but there is no denying that some things are just made up by humans to feel good about themselves. At least he’s aware of that.It’s not as if he regrets choosing this path. He doesn’t regret things and he doesn't look back. What’s the point of brooding over things that cannot be changed? What he’s annoyed about isn’t the fact that he ended up on the “wrong side” of society, it’s the fact that people are so obsessed with themselves that they refuse to see that there’s another side even if it’s right before their eyes. How they fail to know – not even understand – that things are just different and not necessarily wrong or weird just because they aren’t accustomed to it is beyond Chuuya.“Nakahara-san, are you listening?”Chuuya glances across the table at Kunikida and Dazai.“Yes,” he says, “go on.”Chuuya only pays half his attention because he already knows what to do. He’ll accept all the conditions – that was Boss’ instructions.They conclude the meeting quickly, and Chuuya’s up on his feet and out of the restaurant before Kunikida even straightens from his bow.Dazai has always been quick, so Chuuya isn’t surprised when the younger man catches up to him. They make their way through the crowd side by side in silence, and Chuuya feels the tension already slipping away. They wound up in Yamashita park, and Chuuya leans against the railings as he stares out at the bay.It’s chilly now that it’s night, but Chuuya hardly feels the cold. He suspects his anger has him too heated up.“What has gotten you all worked up?” Dazai asks casually, foregoing the casual bantering and veiled insults for once.Chuuya hates to admit it but he likes it a lot more when Dazai’s being honest with him. It’s true that it’s their language to banter and fight with each other, but that’s their language when they’re hating yet loving each other. Some days, when the love fades, the insults become more personal, designed to hurt. Other days, when the hatred dims, the banter just falls away. Dazai and he have many ways of communicating, just like everybody else.“I’m just angry at things I cannot control.”Dazai hums. “Well, then I’ll stay with you till you’re feeling better.”Chuuya smiles.



Exhaustion
Chapter Summary
Chuuya's tired but he needs to do his work. (Day 97)



Everything’s hazy and his limbs feel like they're each as heavy as an elephant. His mind is fuzzy, white cotton balls of fluff where brain matter should be, and every cell in his body is screaming at him to just stop. But it's not as if Chuuya has time for that. Ever since he became an Executive, all he knows is work. In between the agreements he has to look through and sign and the miscellaneous documents, there isn't really much time for anything else. The Port Mafia has a lot of partners (and enemies), both in the country and out of the country.That's why Chuuya always relishes in a good fight. It's not that he's sadistic and enjoys beating people up (okay, so he does enjoy beating his enemies up but that satisfaction is derived from knowing his enemies lose and not from the act of violence itself); it's that fighting gives him an adrenalin rush that reminds him of the fact that he's alive and that no amount of paperwork can give him. He likes being an Executive, he likes the fact that Boss has so much trust and faith in him, and he likes that he can contribute to the Port Mafia in so many ways. It's just... he can understand why Dazai hates paperwork and almost always leaves his work to his subordinates if he could. Chuuya would delegate - he trusts his men after all - but it's his job to look through those papers so he is going to see it through to the end.“You know, you've been staring at your computer with your eyes glazed over for almost ten minutes now.”Chuuya snaps himself out his thoughts and glances at the clock at the top right hand corner of his laptop screen, his eyes widening when he realises that Dazai is telling the truth and not just trying to get a reaction out of him.“If you're that tired, go to sleep. Chuuya, how are you going to do a good job when your brain isn't working properly?” Dazai asks with a scoff as he peers at Chuuya over the edge of his book. “Besides, I'm sleepy, so get in bed so we can both go to sleep.”“If you're tired, you can go to sleep, mackerel,” Chuuya says before turning back to his computer and reading the last few sentences he wrote. They're definitely not Japanese and he has no idea what they mean. Strange. Chuuya promptly deletes them.“Mm, talking to yourself is the first sign of insanity. Your work is driving you crazy.”Chuuya rolls his eyes. “I was talking to you, idiot.”“Just come to bed. I promise I won't turn off your alarm if you come to bed now. Seriously.”Chuuya pauses. “… really?”Dazai sighs and pats the spot next to him.“Yes, really.”Chuuya saves the document and shuts the laptop before making his way to bed. He's out as soon as his head touches the pillow.



Pause
Chapter Summary
Dazai drops by the hair salon to pay Chuuya a visit. (Day 98) [Oh Baby AU]
Chapter Notes
In the same verse as Oh Baby, You Break My Heart if anyone remembers that.



Dazai grins as he walks into the hair salon. He doesn't particularly need a hair cut, but Chuuya has been so busy lately that this is the only way to see his boyfriend. A stylist shows him to the waiting table, and Dazai spots Chuuya walking towards him with a cup of tea in hand. He opens his mouth to greet Chuuya but the redhead beats him to speaking first.“Have some tea while you wait, sir,” Chuuya says politely, placing the tea down onto the table before bowing slightly and walking away.Is Chuuya ignoring him? They didn't have a fight, and Dazai’s more than sure that he hadn’t done anything insensitive lately. Chuuya almost broke up with him the last time he paid for Chuuya’s school fees so Dazai knows better than to try and help when Chuuya doesn't want it.As he watches Chuuya almost falling asleep at the reception desk, he comes to the conclusion that the redhead had indeed just didn't realise that it was him.Chuuya, I told you not to take on so many part time jobs, Dazai thinks in exasperation.Dazai starts to stand so that he can walk over to Chuuya and tell him just that but then pauses when Chuuya picks up the ringing phone. The stylist from before shows Dazai to his seat, and the man ends up trimming his hair and getting a lighter shade of brown if only so he could stay till Chuuya knocks off. While Dazai’s waiting for the colour to set in, Chuuya walks over to him and places a cup of tea before him before bowing.Dazai grabs his hand before he leaves, and Chuuya jumps a little, an incredulous look on his face. It soon fades to astonishment and a light smile when he realises who it is.“Dazai! What are you doing here?” Chuuya pauses as he furrows his brows. “When did you come in? I didn’t see you at all.”“Chuuya, you served me tea just now.”Chuuya’s eyes widen before he laughs lightly.“Oh.”“You seriously need to rest more.”“Mm. It’s just a long day. Look, I need to get back to work so I’ll talk to you later.”“Let’s go for dinner.”“Only if you’re treating.”“Anything you want.”Chuuya laughs and walks away. Dazai knows that Chuuya will try to split the bill so he already has another plan in mind.Afterwards, Dazai waits outside the salon, and Chuuya emerges a few minutes later. He smiles when he sees Dazai.“So, where are we going?”“It’s a surprise,” Dazai says with a smirk.Chuuya raises an eyebrow but doesn’t say anything as he follows Dazai to his car. They end up at his apartment, and Dazai shows Chuuya to the couch.“You sit here while I cook.”Chuuya grins at him. “You’re the best.”“I know,” Dazai says before walking off to the kitchen. He hopes Chuuya manages to catch some sleep while he prepares dinner.



What Now?
Chapter Summary
Dazai has a question to ask. (Day 100)



Chuuya doesn’t really know what to do about the flower petals that litter the ground or the heart-shaped balloons floating in the air. Nor does he know what to do about the huge Dazai loves Chuuya sign in the middle of the room. His anger at the other gang is shocked out of him, and he doesn’t even remember what he wanted to complain to Dazai about. He stares as Dazai walks over to him, a single stalk of rose in his hand, and a smirk on his handsome face.“My darling, would you be so kind as to do me a favour?”Chuuya continues staring, wondering if he had been transported to some strange universe. This isn’t out of character for Dazai per se, but it’s just so random.“What?”“Would you be so kind as to commit a double suicide with me?”Chuuya rolls his eyes and shoves Dazai in the chest as he pushes past the taller man in annoyance.“No, you fucking bandaged-wit.”“Then would you marry me?”“I said… no… wait, what?” Chuuya whirls around, his eyes wide as he takes in the sight of Dazai looking around nervously. “What did you just say?”“Well, I just asked you if you would marry me,” Dazai repeats calmly. “If you don’t want to – ”“Do it properly!” Chuuya howls at him before shaking his head. He gestures at all the decorations in the room. “What the hell is all this?”“It’s Romantic,” Dazai says before he crosses his arms and pouts. “Do you know how many times I got pricked by the rose thorns when I was plucking the petals? And do you know how much that sign costs?”“So don’t do them,” Chuuya deadpans before he glares at Dazai. “And what about that first question? A double suicide? Seriously?”“Statistics show that you’re more likely to say yes to a request after hearing an absurd request!”“So you know that your double suicide proposals are absurd?”“Not the point, hat rack!”“Whatever, mackerel.”“So will you marry me or not!”“I didn’t say no!”“You didn’t say yes either!”Chuuya rolls his eyes. It’s not as if Dazai doesn't assume the meaning behind every other thing he says anyway, so why is this any different?“You’re an idiot,” Chuuya tells Dazai softly as he takes the detective’s hands into his and smiles at him. “Of course it’s a yes. Who else would I marry?”Dazai smiles and pulls Chuuya into a hug. “Good.”Chuuya’s smile turns wider as he wraps his arms around Dazai’s waist. He has just made a big life decision but, for some reason, it doesn't feel like anything has changed. He tells Dazai as much.“That’s because it hasn’t,” Dazai replies with a shrug. “We always were a pair.”“You’re awfully sappy today.”Dazai sighs. “Romantic, Chuuya, romantic.”Chuuya rolls his eyes.“Well, what now?”Dazai laughs as he pulls away. He smiles down at Chuuya.“Now, we live our lives together.”
