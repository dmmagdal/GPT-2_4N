It takes all day for her to exhaust her jumbled mental maps and it's still not enough, because he has to tell her to slow down, to sit down, to take a break before she hurts herself. They sit and share water under the corrugated overhang of a broken bus stop, and that's all the rest she needs before she has him by the hand again.The first thing they discover together is a library. Jade loves the way the marble columns of the portico reach up and up and up, so he relents, lets her fingers slip from his as she runs off to balance on a balustrade with arms spread like wings. He's almost ashamed of how easily he settles into his role, but as she's peering through dirt-caked windows and walking through shadows, he's the one watching heat shimmers, waiting for them to part like an oil-slick for monsters. When the library doors whip open, belching out a cloud of yellowed paper chased by a shriek and a peal of laughter, his heart jumps into his throat, his sword gripped and poised, before he realizes it's just her.She wants to go in, begs and pleads and smiles and all but drags him in herself; he wants to keep moving, to cover as much ground as possible before they head out.He wins, but only because he's not even done talking when she bolts down the sidewalk, chasing after a page that keeps snapping out of her reach.She's out of breath when he catches up to her, panting but grinning like nothing had ever been more fun, or more important, even though her hands are empty and her prize is gone. He gives her a once over, checks to make sure she's not meeting the basic requirements of dying, and presses his lips into a hard line.“Yeah, so, that was fun and everything, but if we're done with accomplishing jack shit, maybe we could head back,” he says. She doesn't wilt like he expects her to, just takes a few bounding steps ahead, twirling in the light and the dust with her eyes closed until her steps stumble and her world spins into him.He has her by the wrists to keep her from falling, her skin kissed with a little sunburn where she'd rolled up her sleeves; she looks up at him, wobbles, and finally says, “I'll go wherever you want to go, Dave.”three.A week goes by before they make their first night excursion, running territory along the edge of the city where they hadn't dared to go with the sun watching hot and hateful over their shoulders. She takes him to what used to be an estate, proud wrought iron and crumbling brick palisades standing tall in the folds of pearl-white dunes, where the wind billows thick, gleaming ribbons of sand across the courtyard and belts into their skin. She thinks it's gorgeous, says as much to him, and he doesn't respond.They slip in through an open door and set to exploring, Jade taking the lead as they lose themselves in shadows and fumble through dark rooms. The house groans around them on the moors of its splintering, spidering foundation, and their voices stay hushed in return, as though they're afraid of waking it; a quiet, sour swear is all Dave spits when he bumps his shin against a china cabinet, a short giggle from Jade as she trips into a chair. Their first encounter with the terror coiling up in their chests is when Jade loses her footing and takes a tumble against a cabinet in the kitchen; the doors swing open and half a dozen copper pans spill out onto the tile, crashing like a gunshot that spins off the ceiling and clatters down the hall they came from, making the loudest sound either had heard since stepping foot on a planet full of graveyard silence.He moves on instinct, pulling her into him with his left hand and drawing his sword with his right, pressing her against the wall and placing himself between the things he's sure are coming, the things that could pull shadows like a curtain with faces split by sharp-toothed grins. They stand like that, stone-still and breathing shallow, for seconds, minutes, what feels like ages until their hearts slow and the adrenaline leaves them tired.“Let's just go,” he whispers, runs a check on her in the low light and feels what he might later describe as a stab of failure when he sees something black and wet trickling from her temple. “Shit, you're bleeding.”“Dave, it's fine, we're already here! Let's keep exploring.”“No, no, no. Jesus fucking Christ. We're leaving. Here.”He presses his sleeve against the side of her head until the bleeding stops, then for the first time, laces their fingers together of his own accord, a grip tight enough to take the feeling from his fingertips by the time they make it back to her home.four.He hustles her into what used to be a post office when he notices the sun drop below the horizon, ticking off all the things he did wrong that kept them in the city for too long: he fell asleep when they took a break in the shade of a schoolyard, just half an hour but enough to set them back; he indulged Jade's whims too much, let her go running off to look into a broken storefront just to see what got left behind; he got lost in the maze of streets downtown, winding around the same six blocks like an idiot over and over. It's all his responsibility and he feels like a damn fool.They settle onto a torn waiting couch, him on one end and her on the other; Jade sprawls out in seconds, reminding him of a cat the way she just unfolds, her head on the arm rest and one arm dangling off, one arm draping over the back, knees and legs over his lap. He's too tired to complain or move her.They sit like that for awhile and he's about to drift off when she breaks the silence: “It's fine, right?”He blinks a few times, rubs the corners of his eyes, and looks at her. “What's fine?”“This. Staying here tonight. The city's empty, right? So it's fine?”“Yeah,” he agrees, thinly, and she smiles at the bit of cold comfort. “Why ask me, though? I mean, don't you have tarot cards or whatever you can throw down? Maybe cut open a chicken or something?”She laughs, reaches out for his shoulder to jab him lightly but misses. “You're so silly sometimes, Dave. I just know things, but I don't know everything!”He leans his head back against the wall and the quiet white noise of the city swallows the conversation; time becomes seconds, or minutes, or hours, lost in the growing darkness and the shifting, shifting, shifting to get comfortable. Jade's half hanging off on her stomach when she gets up with a start, enough to alarm him but not enough to ask what's wrong.“Dave?”“What?”She swings her legs off, curls them around the other way, and he feels her head settling into the crook of his neck, her arms around his waist. “I'm glad you're here.”“Yeah, well.” He shifts, unsure of what to do with his hands. “Someone has to make sure something gets done in this game.”five.He's woken by cold fingers threading through his hair, pulling at his clothes, and he's ready with a sharp “Jade!” only for the fingers to pull at his lips and his cheeks when he opens his mouth, the taste like gravel and oil and fire--Adrenaline flares hot and angry through his veins and he tears them away, feels his clothes get spattered with something wet and foul and he's holding something that's not attached to anything anymore; it fills him with a primal sort of satisfaction, grinning with a clenched jaw.The things have finally come, the things that can pull shadows like curtains with faces split by sharp-toothed grins. He takes his sword and time slows to a cold-honey crawl; he splits their grins wider and wider until they burst like black bubbles, over and over again, until he hears nothing but the wind carrying quiet.It's in the fading of battle that he counts his breaths, and it's somewhere between five and six that he realizes Jade is gone. It's somewhere between six and seven that he bursts full-tilt into the street, looking and looking and looking to find a shock of black hair and waiting to hear her call out, to laugh, to anything. It's somewhere between twelve and thirteen that he feels a sharp pain welling up in his gut and the stomach-sick feeling that she's dead and he killed her.He scrambles around street corners until morning comes, shouting her name as long and loud as he can until his voice is too thick and sore to carry far enough to matter.six.|PESTERLOG|--turntechGodhead [TG] began pestering gardenGnostic [GG]--TG: jadeTG: answer meTG: for fuck's sakeTG: just look at your computerTG: do you even have your computer with you?TG: shitTG: if there was any time for you to be psychic and weirdTG: this would be itTG: so if you could come flying out of a back alley or somethingTG: anytime nowTG: that would be greatTG: goddamnit jadeTG: please-- turntechGodhead [TG] ceased pestering gardenGnostic [GG] --seven.|PESTERLOG|-- turntechGodhead [TG] began pestering ectoBiologist [EB] --TG: johnTG: johnTG: have you heard from jade?TG: fuckTG: shitTG: fuckTG: like this game could possibly get worseTG: first she wants to wade out into a nuclear wasteland like goddamn priscilla, queen of the desertTG: now i lose herTG: i dont see her and shes not answeringTG: how do you even lose someone who sleeps like twenty hours a dayTG: godTG: what if shes likeTG: does she even have any weapons?EB: whoa, hey!EB: calm down.EB: i'm sure she's fine!EB: i bet she just found something cool to show you and she's on her way back.TG: yeah youre rightTG: she probably saw a butterfly on a planet with no life and went flailing after it or whateverTG: even though apparently this place is fucking crawling with these shadow douchesTG: im sure shes fineTG: i just fucking killed our witchEB: don't blame yourself!EB: i think jade can take care of herself better than you think.TG: just keep an eye outEB: you know i will.TG: thanks manEB: btw...EB: priscilla was the bus.EB: not a person.TG: johnTG: jesus fucking christTG: i dont care if the bus was rosebudTG: i just need to find jadeEB: i know. i'm sorry.EB: i'll tell rose.EB: we'll find her, dave!eight.Breathing in the minutes becomes agony right around hour thirty-two.His voice is slipping from him, strained and cracked and barely a flutter of paper in the wind when he calls for her, but it doesn't stop him; he yells it again and again and again until his gums and his tongue dry and he tastes the tang of copper when he closes his mouth. He licks his chapped lips, waits for the sting to fade, fills his lungs with fire, and calls for her until the feeling of burning from the inside out is too much to take.Then he repeats it all da capo twelve more times.He has to fight with himself to take a break. Weak on his legs, he pulls himself shaking into the backseat of a half-gutted sedan, limbs tingling, muscles taut and twitching, head swimming in a deep, throbbing ache. Water, he remembers; he hasn't been drinking enough, too much running and shouting and not enough taking care of priorities. (Or maybe too much of that, too.) He drinks half the bottle without pause and it drags down his throat like sandpaper, bucking nausea in his empty stomach. He pinches the bridge of his nose until it passes.Thirty-six hours and he collects himself, climbs out of the car, fills his lungs with fire, and calls for her until all the sagging buildings in the city know her name.nine.He sees a leaning basilica, still regal even as it sinks into a crumbling decay, thinks to look for Jade inside because it's old and sad and pretty and he knows she finds an inexplicable comfort in those things. He takes ginger steps around colored sprays of stained glass scattered on the floor, looks for footsteps in the thick coating of dust, searches up and up and up a tower until the stairs end in a dead drop three stories below. After an hour, he stops, decides it's time to nurse his headache, and settles against the cool stone wall of an alcove. He closes his eyes, counts the seconds and minutes because it's natural to him now, feels the spin of the planet as it ticks on through an artificial cycle as easy as breathing, and in this moment he hates and loves the game for giving him something to hold onto.After eleven minutes and nineteen seconds, he hears the groaning of tall, ancient doors open, then footsteps muted by dust, and he's already up and running.“Jade?” he yells; the vibration of his own voice makes his head hurt and he doesn't care, shouting it every time he winds around a corner. He sees her there at the entrance, standing in the sunlight, bright and grinning and caked with dirt and grime and he's never been happier in his life. She throws herself into him and squeezes, exaggerating every bruise and cut he's accumulated in the last two days, and his only protest is letting out a long, shaky breath as he pulls her in closer.“I missed you so much,” she says into his shoulder and he doesn't respond, only pries her away with his hands on her upper arms, looking her up and down, checking for injuries. She laughs, murmurs that she's fine, he shouldn't worry, and he shakes his head.“What are you doing here?” she asks, weaving their fingers together; he feels the corners of his mouth twitch into a grin, and he lets them, feels like he deserves a celebration at this point.“Just, you know, killing time, waiting for Egbert and Lalonde to stop making out with each other and get their slow asses through the gate.” He spins her around to face him and she takes the movement gracefully, like a dancer, glass clinking under her feet like music. “Seriously, what do you think? You're like an hour and a half late to the party. I've been looking for you. What are you doing here?”She lets go of his hand and walks down an aisle between scattered pews, looking up at the empty windows rimmed with jagged color. “I came because I thought it was pretty.”He shoulders up beside her, looking where her eyes are looking, trying, if only briefly, to see the world like she does. “Don't you think that's fucked up, Jade? This isn't a museum or some shit where you just stroll from exhibit to exhibit and touch everything and get kicked out. Everyone's dead. It's not a game.”He pauses.“It is a game. But it's not.”She runs her fingers through the dust along the tilted lectern and smiles, but it doesn't reach her eyes. He regrets saying it. “Is it really that bad? I just thought...Well, everything got left behind. You see how everyone died, and that's sad, it really is. It's the saddest thing. But then you see how everyone lived, too, and that's what makes it beautiful.”He considers her words for a moment, and then he makes a decision.With a hand on her waist, a hand curling into her hair, fingers splayed, he pulls her in and kisses her, and everything in the world is right.And then everything in the world turns wrong.He notices the taste first, sharp in the back of his teeth, a tang of copper and metal and electricity and he pushes her away like he's been bitten, steps back and looks at her, looks at her, sees her glazed eyes, sees shadows boil and quiver and fan out into wings; he steps back, limbs locked, frozen and hesitating and by the time he pulls out his sword, she's surrounded, consumed, reaching out for him.He feels it before he knows it's there, claws at his back tearing wet, fatty gashes through his jacket, the shrieking pain—it's not the pain that's shrieking, it's him, it's her, it's him, it's her, it's her, it's herHe snaps awake, chokes in a bitter breath as his stomach knots, his jaw throbs, his throat constricts, and he scrambles to his knees, dry-heaving at the feet of a statue over and over until he feels like his ribs are shattering. He wipes his mouth on his sleeve, head clear enough now to hear a distant rhythm; he thinks it's the sound of her shoes as she's running, running towards him or running from a grinning shadow, a pounding, steady cadence on fractured concrete. He cringes when the realization dawns that his veneer of composure is blistering in the sun, that he's pushed himself too hard, that it's only his own heartbeat.He rubs his face with the last of his water, presses the heels of his hands into his eyes, snakes his fingers up into his hair and tugs, hard.Four hours later, hour fifty-seven, after heading back into the city proper and long since giving the basilica wide berth, his teeth still buzz with the tang of copper and metal and electricity.ten.|PESTERLOG|-- tentacleTherapist [TT] began pestering turntechGodhead [TG] –TT: Dave.TT: I need to talk to you.TT: Urgently.TT: If you would, at your earliest convenience, kindly crawl out of whatever yawning existential fissure you seem to have tumbled into ass over teakettle, it would be incredibly helpful.TT: I have a rather distressed companion on my hands who seems to think both you and Jade are dead, and I am close to exhausting my admittedly limited repertoire of mollification techniques short of rendering him unconscious.TT: It's honestly all I can do to keep John on the ground. You know how he is.-- turntechGodhead [TG] is now an idle chum! --TT: Where the hell are you?TT: Answer us.TT: Please.eleven.When the flashing in the corner of his glasses becomes a little too much like psychological warfare for him to handle, he pulls them off, folds them, and slips them neatly into the breast pocket of his suit.The city gleams in the harsh afternoon sunlight; his eyes, too attuned for too long to the conveniences of dark lenses, have trouble adjusting, and he spends the next twenty minutes stumbling through the streets half-blind, squinting against a watery haze and blinking through spots in his vision.twelve.It's early morning, seventy-five hours, forty-two minutes, twenty-nine seconds since she fell off the grid, and there's something about time now that he just feels down in the marrow of his bones, a finality he refuses to accept even exists; he's out of supplies, out of energy, voice dead, nails dirty and bleeding and the skin on his hands raw and shredded from clawing into buildings from the rubble.He pauses in the street when he hears the quick, roaring staccato of a gunshot. It's real this time, not a dream, not his heartbeat, and he bolts off on straining legs, following a sound that can't be captured as its vagaries fly from rooftop to rooftop and echo down the street.He stops, breathes, nurses his side, and hears a second shot, closer this time, close enough to pinpoint it. He tears towards the library, doesn't think he's run as fast or as hard in his life; it takes him forty-two seconds to reach the doors, one to pull them open, and he yells her name at the top of his lungs, the top of his weak, strained voice, every footstep he takes inside.The third shot scatters like thunder above him and he's running to the staircase, heart in his throat, sword in his hand; he takes the stairs three at a time, holding his balance against the wall, nails dragging red streaks like fingerpaint. He pauses at the top, looks around the mezzanine, then he hears the fourth gunshot ringing in his ears and he knows he's found her.After seventy-five hours, forty-four minutes, and fifty-four seconds, the shadow looming over her, wings spread, teeth bared, is nothing, means nothing and comes to nothing; he jumps, finds purchase on its back, thrusts his sword into the base of its neck, and tears down until it falls, until the only things left of it are the black, oily flecks on his suit.He's breathing deep and heavy, and so is she, and for a moment, that's the only noise in the room—until she picks up her rifle, levels it at him, and he thinks the look on his face might be of betrayal.He flips his sword upside-down, resting the blade flat from wrist to elbow, as he holds his hands out in what he hopes is nonthreatening. “Okay, Jade, seriously. It's just me. It's Dave. Put the gun down. I know you're a little weird and crazy sometimes, but this is completely backflipping off the fucking ship overboard.”She doesn't put the gun down.She pulls the trigger.He feels a warm splatter against his back, looks over his shoulder and sees a black mess dripping down a column, down the wall, and he hangs his head, feels a hysterical sort of laughter bubble up from his gut; he manages a short, curt holy shit, a manic grin, and then he moves to her, drops his sword, takes her in his arms and pulls her close and tight.His voice is a whisper because that's all he can manage: “Never. Again. Okay? I will just fucking lose my shit if I ever have to do this for you again.”She squirms in his grip, nuzzles into his neck, smiles against his shoulder. They stand like that, stone-still, listening to the white noise of the city, the off-kilter rhythm of their heartbeats and quiet breathing, when she finally breaks the silence: “Are you okay?”He's done. He hasn't had water in too long, hasn't had food or sleep in longer, and there are only so many miracles adrenaline and tempered determination can perform; in the last hours, he was fighting off exhaustion of belief more than exhaustion of body, that deep and horrible feeling that ate at him until he wasn't sure what he was doing anymore.He knows he has wounds to tend to, bruises that will spiral and blossom and stretch across his skin in a few days, cuts packed with dirt that might go to infection if he leaves them too long. Even when they fade, he's not sure how long he's going to keep dreaming of the shock of copper and metal and electricity, of the heartsick feeling that she's gone and it's his fault.He buries his face in her hair just to make sure it's not another dream.“No,” he breathes, finally.thirteen.|PESTERLOG|-- tentacleTherapist [TT] began pestering turntechGodhead [TG] --TT: So, what is this I've been hearing about dazzling heroics?

She turns to him, his hand in hers as she plays with the valleys of his knuckles with her thumb for reasons only she knows, and breaks the silence.“It's so pretty, don't you think?”He has an answer for her for once, making up for all the times before where he didn't: “Yeah. It is.”A look of sheer delight spreads over her face and she nods, a full-teeth smile and eyelids pulled in mirth.zero.|PESTERLOG|-- turntechGodhead [TG] began pestering gardenGnostic [GG] --TG: your house creeps me the fuck outTG: im sorryTG: but however much of a gargantuan badass your grandfather wasTG: he was and still is equally creepy as all hellGG: huh???GG: its not creepy!!GG: its perfectly normalGG: you are being so ridiculous!!!!!!!!TG: im sitting here watching your soulless robot typingTG: specifically typing what YOURE typingTG: in your headTG: but cant physically typeTG: because youre asleepTG: i dare anyone to not be creeped out by this shit playing out in front of meTG: uncanny valley wishes it was your bedroom right nowTG: stephen king would be moved to suicideGG: ._.GG: what are you doing in my bedroom?GG: there are other rooms in my house you know! <_<GG: i told you you could go anywhere you wanted!TG: where the hell else is there to goGG: -___-TG: no reallyTG: i could spend the rest of the day sneezing in your greenhouseTG: or get lost in a medieval theme restaurant storage roomTG: or yeah i could chill with your stuffed grandfatherTG: that seems like a stellar ideaTG: why do you always say the dumbest shit when youre asleepGG: hey!!GG: why do you always say the meanest stuff when you are awake???TG: ask the taxidermists wet dream a couple floors downTG: i wasnt feeling particularly ornery until i realized i had like a thousand dead glass eyes staring at meTG: when id rather wander out into satans sandy asscrack than be in your houseTG: something is wrong on a fundamental levelTG: so seriouslyTG: wake up alreadyGG: you know i cant wake up on command! >:OGG: ill wake up when im good and ready mr bossy pants!!!!!!TG: bossy pantsTG: honestlyTG: god nevermindTG: ill talk to you when you wake upTG: too bad you wont make even a fraction more sense thenGG: heheheheGG: dont be mad at me dave! <3GG: well go out there soon!!GG: and itll be a little sad...and scary........GG: but kinda fun!GG: and when we go out there we might not see each other for awhile!!GG: you might get really worried but it will be okay, i promiseGG: and you should know that i trust you <3TG: yeah see thats what im talking aboutTG: none of that shit made any sense at allTG: its like talking to an excitable ouija boardGG: heheheGG: see you when i wake up! <3<3<3TG: good nightTG: i guess~fin﻿
