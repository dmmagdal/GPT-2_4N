“Shh… Shh, I’m here… It’s okay, it’s over…” Wade Wilson/Darcy Lewis?
Chapter Notes

        See the end of the chapter for  notes




It had not been a good week for Darcy B. Lewis.There was the busted shoelace on Monday, then the dry cleaners wrecked her favorite sweater on Tuesday, her local bakery discontinued the little mint-avocado tartlets that were her favorites come Wednesday, Thursday her mother called, and on Friday she was kidnapped.  Again.I am becoming a one-woman cliche, she thought to herself.  They’d injected her with something that had given her chills, sweats, blurred vision, and intermittent nausea.  It felt like the worst flu bug ever, but - knowing her luck and the week she’d just had - it would probably turn out to be something far, far worse.  Like the beginning of a zombie virus, or something.She lay on the floor of her cell, too weak to drag herself to the oh-so-comfy looking cot (note the sarcasm) they had stuck in one corner.  She wasn’t sure how much time had passed, probably more than a day but less than a week.  She kept losing time, or maybe her captors were just screwing with her.  It seemed like every time she woke up she was wearing a different hospital gown, but they were always a uniquely off-putting shade of blue.  It had been four gowns and two meals - that she could recall - since she had been kidnapped.  Not for the first time, she wondered if it might not have been a good idea to take Tony up on his offer of a subcutaneous tracker.  In the end, the cons had outweighed the pros, but she was reevaluating her stance now.It might make her feel like the Avengers’ pet, but it was still better than being kidnapped and experimented on.  At least, that’s what she assumed they were doing with her.  Why else would they draw blood before and after every (remembered) meal?Darcy drifted again.This time, when she woke, she was underwater, in a tank.  Downside: she was in a fucking tank, upside: she had some sort of breathing apparatus on her face so she wasn’t drowning.  The water (god, she hoped it was water) was tinted faintly green, but it didn’t sting her eyes when she opened them.  She was in a lab, not exactly a shock.  There were four other tubes that she could see, each empty.  Two different scientists (those white coats were a bit of a giveaway) were circling her tank, taking notes on a tablet and a pad of paper, respectively.She didn’t feel sick anymore, but the lack of physical distractions let her focus on how terrified she was.  Darcy could hear a beeping sound getting faster and faster - My heart, she realized - and she started pulling on the oxygen mask, trying to yank it off because shecouldn’t breathe, they must have messed something up because she suddenly couldn’t - she couldn’t -The tank turned red abruptly.  No, wait, that was blood.  There was blood splashed on the outside of the tank and tablet scientist was dead on the floor.  A red and black blur was backing notepad scientist back into a corner, but by this time Darcy had managed to get the mask off and was trying to find a way out of the tank.  There was no latch, nothing she could grab inside, there was nothing.  She hit the glass as hard as she could but nothing - nothing.  She was going to drown in a tank in a lab and she’d never get to -The red and black blur was in front of her tank now, and it was definitely a person and he was… waving at her?  What the f - ?The upraised hand stilled, and Darcy watched as he counted down on his fingers, 5-4-3-2-1 until he had a fist and then he punched the glass in.  He was quick enough to grab her instead of letting her fall to the floor with all the broken glass and please-god-let-that-be-water, and he was strong enough to lift her completely off the ground even with all of the water rushing over his legs and feet.Darcy was gasping and crying, holding onto the strange man in the red and black bodysuit because he was there, and because he’d broken her out of the tank, and because she could breathe again.He shifted her around until she was basically koala-hugging him: arms around his neck and legs around his waist.  Some part of her wanted to object because she was neither a five year old, nor was she about to fuck him, but he was stupidly tall and, really, she was in no fit state to object.She buried her face against his neck and breathed in the smells of leather, gunpowder, and blood.  It was surprisingly comforting.Darcy felt one of his hands tentatively patting her hair.  His other arm was looped under her butt, hand gripping her thigh.  “Shh… Shh, I’m here… It’s okay, it’s over…” he said, attempting to comfort her, but sounding more than a little nervous.Even after who-knew-how-long with her captors, she recognized those words.  She recognized them immediately and, even though she knew not all soulmates were good for each other, even though she knew that there were no real guarantees, she felt something in her relax immediately.  Darcy was already pressed against him, but now she tightened her grip almost as if she wanted to climb inside his suit.  She was still frightened on some level, but he was safe.  He’d saved her.She sniffled a few times, trying to draw up what she could of her composure, then leaned back so she could look him in the face, sort of.  He had a surprisingly expressive mask, and right now she could tell his eyebrows were raised expectantly.  He shifted his hand from her hair to her waist, bracing her as her weight shifted against him.“I hope you killed all those sons of bitches,” she told him.  Pressed against him as she was, she could feel it as every single inch of him, every muscle (and there were a lot of those) went completely rigid at her words.He let out a slow exhale through his teeth and raised one gloved hand to cup her cheek.  “They’re deader than disco, sweetheart, but if I’d known they’d hurt you I would’ve killed them nice’n slow.”On a normal day, the sincerity in his voice as he talked about killing someone slowly on her behalf would have freaked her out, but Darcy had had a very bad week.  The worst week, in fact, so instead she said, “Thank you,” and let him carry her out of the lab and into the cool night air.

“Darcy, Cap - Cap, Darcy,” Tony said hurriedly, quickly bypassing them to get to the kitchen (and the coffee).Darcy was on her Best Behavior, so the very first thing she said to Steve Rogers as he took her hand to shake it was, “Pleased to meet you, Captain.”He, in turn, said, “I’ve heard lots of good things about you from Thor.”Now, she had known that she would be meeting a soulmate soon(ish) ever since the Asgardian first tumbled into their lives.  At least, she’d known that A) it was coming - because how many people named Thor could you befriend in one lifetime? and B) that her soulmate would be one of Thor’s buddies.  She had thought that she had prepared herself for any possibility.  She was very, very wrong.“Holy crap,” she breathed, her hold on his hand going from nice-to-meet-you polite to you-are-my-only-lifeline-and-I-will-not-be-letting-go-of-my-own-volition viselike.  “So,” she said, trying (and likely failing) to be casual, “you wouldn’t happen to have, like, a super genericsoulmark about meeting someone, would you?”Steve squinted at her suspiciously.  “Did Tony put you up to this?”In response, Darcy reached down and lifted up her shirt, showing him where his words curved down from her breastbone to trace right along the lower line of her ribs.  She sucked in a breath when she felt fingers lightly tracing the words and hastily shoved her shirt back down, knocking his hand away.“Sorry,” he said immediately, the tips of his ears going a bit pink.“Yeesh,” Darcy joked, “at least buy me dinner first.”He was staring at her.  “I’m sorry,” he said after a moment, “I just… I grew up blank.  When they got me out of the ice, I had words but I didn’t really believe it.  But you’re - ” he reached towards her slowly, then seemed to realize what he was doing and dropped his hand.  Then he went one better and put both hands behind his back, slipping into parade rest.Darcy thought, Fuck that, dropped her Best Behavior, and went in for the hug.Steve immediately put his arms around her, one going low to curve around her waist, the other cupping the back of her head as she held him tight.“For the record,” she said, words slightly muffled by his shirt, “I’m 100% real.”Steve let out a soft sigh.  “You really are, aren’t you?”“Yup.  ‘Sides, I doubt Captain America has a twisted enough imagination to dream up somebody as awesome as I am.”His grip at her hip and hair tightened momentarily.  “I think you’d be surprised what Steve Rogers can imagine,” he said.Darcy gulped.

to find the happiness i seek - chapter 2: in which Darcy speaks - She heard his whispered, “Omega…” and it sent a shot of fear through her heart.
Chapter Summary
I was shocked, SHOCKED, I tell you, when the very first request I received for this prompt was for “to find the happiness I seek.”  Truly, words cannot describe the depth of my surprise. 
Chapter Notes
Technically speaking, I consider this not-quite-canon for the story because I wasn't really happy with how it came out.  ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK.

He knew, in hindsight, that he hadn’t been entirely sane at that point.  He’d been operating on instinct, aggression, and a soul-deep rage that might never be fully exorcised.  He remembered the satisfaction he derived from infiltrating and destroying the base.  He didn’t enjoy the killing, but knowing that he was lessening Hydra’s numbers, that anyone he turned his gun on was one less of their number out in the world - that he took pleasure in.  He remembered being focused on the hunt to the exclusion of all else: nothing mattered but the finding and finishing of any Hydra assets he could get his hands on.And then…Then, there was her.The hallway reeked of aggression, sweat, and a peculiar smell that he had never had a name for but always instinctively loathed.  He had smelled it before, on the men (and sometimes women) who had hurt or belittled his mate.  He had smelled it on bullies, on scientists, on almost every officer he could recall encountering over the past seventy-odd years.  It was a petty smell, an eager smell, and finding it here, in what he recognized as a prison block, made his hackles raise along with the corners of his mouth as he bared his teeth in mute threat.He saw only a hallway, no soldiers left to guard it.  He had killed many on his way here, but whoever might have been patrolling the area had long since gone: either come to meet him, or fled.  He prowled down the length of the hallway twice, listening.  Only one cell was occupied, but he could tell little more than that.  He punched in the control panel at the end of the hall and ripped at the exposed and sparking wires until the emergency protocols kicked on.  Most Hydra bases had similar failsafes in the event of a destructive event.  They had spent so long being so powerful, so ubiquitous: why risk the death of an asset you can simply recapture at your leisure?The door opened smoothly, but what he found nearly sent him to his knees.  The room was filled, saturated, with the smell of fear.  The scent was layered from the length of time the occupant had spent within the room: old fears and new fears tangled together and told a story of a person who had been tormented almost to the point of madness.  Female, young, healthy but sickening, and - “Omega,” he breathed.This was wrong, this was new, unlike anything he’d found in any of the bases he’d cleaned out previously.  In fact, the last time he’d encountered anything remotely like this -There was a soft whimper and it made his whole body come to attention.  That was a fear-noise, a sound that meant save-me and help-me and protect-me, don’t-hurt-me, andplease all at once.  His eyes moved unerringly towards the source of that sound and he saw the slightest flicker of movement through a break in a small screen set to one side of the cell.He moved slowly, edging around the screen until he could see the Omega.  She was curled up in as small a ball as she could manage, wedged into a corner between a toilet and a wall.  Her eyes were large and terrified, he could see the whites all the way around her irises, which were light - blue, if he had to guess.  Her hair was tangled around her shoulders, her pale skin had a faint sheen of sweat, and she was quietly hyperventilating as she stared at him.She opened her mouth but all that came out was a brief whine before she snapped it shut again with a soft clack of teeth meeting.  The sound was like a fist grabbing hold of his insides and twisting.  She hunched back further into her corner, looking like she was trying to sink through the wall.“Omega,” he started, but he didn’t really have the words he needed.  Even if he had, he doubted she would be capable of really hearing him.  He weighed his options briefly but he couldn’t leave her, which meant she had to come with him.  He couldn’t - wouldn’t - frighten her further, so he needed her cooperation.He dropped to his knees and bared his neck, rolling his head to one side so that he could at least look at the door while he left himself thus exposed.The Omega let out another whine, this one was less frightened and more… curious?  Hopeful?  It was something, enough that he knew she was looking at him and not justreacting to him.“Omega,” he said, turning his head back a little - still keeping it tilted but needing to make eye contact to impress upon her his sincerity.  “Not a threat,” he said, and it was a promise he felt he could keep.He couldn’t foresee the threat he might pose to her, the problems they would encounter.  If he had, though… James honestly wasn’t sure if he could have done differently.  He couldn’t have left her, once he found her, and he couldn’t bear to let her go, once she came into his keeping.It was probably that last, more than any of the blood on his hands, that proved he was a damned soul - no matter what Steve said to the contrary.

"Oh how you shine, pretty one," she crooned, one thumb stroking along his cheekbone. --Darcy Does the Monster Mash, chapter 1.

The tiny woman had very, very sharp teeth and she was displaying a lot of them in a bright smile directed at him.  It was, simultaneously, one of the loveliest and most threatening sights Tony had ever seen.“Oh, how you shine, pretty one,” she crooned, and he felt a soft brush along his cheekbone.  “Here,” she said, lightly tapping at his temple.He didn’t like people handing him things, let alone touching him without his permission, but he’d been caught off guard and couldn’t regain his composure while she keptsurprising him.  The look on her face was not one that he had seen pointed in his direction all that often: it was a look of unmitigated, uncomplicated approval.  As if he had done something absolutely fantastic, just for her.“And here,” she continued, tapping his arc reactor with something that made a faint clicking noise, so he looked down and saw talons.  Fucking talons, the likes of which he’d never seen on any creature outside of a museum.“What the fu - ” he managed before he was being pulled into a kiss that lasted a second but felt like forever.  He’d never been kissed like this, and he had enjoyed his fair share (and several other peoples’ fair shares) of kisses.  It was like he was being hugged, like he was being wrapped up in sunshine, like the smooth burn of good liquor, like hot metal and discovery and creation and joy and -She released him and spun away, saying something to the trio behind her.  He shook his head, trying to shake off whatever-it-was that she had done, but he could still feel it, feelher.  It felt like that smile she had given him, but he could feel it in the back of his brain.“What the hell just happened?” he asked.  And does she charge a fee?

Clint was stationed on the roof of the building nearest the lab, watching as Coulson packed everything away.  Part of him thought it was overkill, the rest of him thought that they were probably saving the scientists from themselves.  His assignment was definitely overkill.  The odds of either Foster or Selvig posing some sort of threat was laughable.  Lewis, on the other hand, she looked kind of scrappy.  She’d been sticking to the outskirts of the group for the most part, looking resigned.He watched her sigh, set her shoulders back, and start for Rumlow.  This was interesting.  Foolhardy, too.  Rumlow was a tough sonuvabitch, and a strict commander.  He was also one of the last people Clint thought likely to be swayed by any sort of flirtatious manipulation.But, judging by the Lewis girls’ body language, flirtation was not the name of the game.  She looked about as meek and mild as she could be as she stopped before the Strike Commander and started speaking.  Clint was a little annoyed that she was at an angle, he couldn’t make out what she was saying.What he could see had him sitting up, one finger on his comm and prepped to draw Coulson’s attention.  Whatever the girl had said had brought Rumlow from relaxed to alert in about a second.  Was she a threat?  Had they missed something in their threat assessment?…nope.Oh, come on, Brock, not the time! Clint thought, though he would admit that Lewis was rather… stacked.
“Your chances are slim to none, sorry.”

Huh, okay so, she hadn’t been flirting - something to do with the equip - ?

“Area 51? Do you have any idea how often I got shit for that in basic?”
Clint, who had on occasion shared a locker room with the Strike team, blinked twice, then actually said, “What?”“What is it?” Coulson asked immediately.“Um.  Nothing?”“Barton.”“It’s nothing,” he insisted.  “Really.  I just… stubbed my toe…”It was a testament to their long working relationship, during which Clint had done far more inane things on far more dangerous missions, that Coulson only sighed and said, “Please refrain from using the comms unless you actually hurt yourself.”“Hey, stubbed toes hurt!”“Barton.”“Yes, sir.”He tuned back in in time to see Brock say, “Something like that. You have any interest in exchanging emails?”Smooth, he thought, rolling his eyes.  You’re lucky she’s your soulmate, that line never works.  Well, not when I try it.He tuned out of their conversation and scanned the area again, doing a quick threat check before focusing on the most interesting development he’d been privy to in Puente Antiguo.  The Lewis girl was leaning in a little, clearly interested though trying to disguise it.  Brock, on the other hand, though likely inscrutable to his soulmate, was reading loud and clear to Clint.Is he going to let her go? Clint wondered as Lewis turned away (and towards him).  He watched Brock lean towards her, his facial expression shifting so quickly it was impossible to divine any single emotion.  It was strange to see the usually self-possessed soldier so rattled.  Then again, meeting your soulmate on an op was something Clint had had experience with.So long as Brock didn’t bring her back to base and introduce her as their newest agent, he would probably be fine.

He was gorgeous and he was yelling at the sky and now he was yelling at her.  Darcy had her taser out and pointed at him in moments, finger hovering over the trigger because maybe they could resolve this - she could use her words, find some way to get through to the rando crazy desert dude -He took a step towards her, looming like a freaking giant (how tall was he?), brows drawn down into a thunderous frown, “You dare threaten Thor with such a puny weapon – ”…or not.She was pushing down on the trigger before he could take another step, looking him dead in the eyes as his words cut off, a look of surprised recognition swept over his face, and then the barbs of Old Reliable were hitting him in the chest and he was dropping to the ground, twitching.It was probably just adrenaline that had her heart racing, and latent guilt that made her race to his side to see if he was okay.“What did you do?” Jane cried.“It’s okay,” Darcy assured her, dropping to her knees beside tall, blond, and crazy, and yanking the barbs out with a swift jerk.  “He’ll be fine, I know CPR.  He’ll be fine, I’m sure.”  She wasn’t actually certain who she was reassuring at that point.  Jane was looking at her with concern and Erik just looked confused, why was she freaking out so badly?  “But, um.  We should probably get him to a hospital.  Little help here?”

“Darcy…”The brunette’s attention was immediately captured by the thin thread of anxiety she could hear in Beth’s voice.  “What’s going on, Bethy-Boo?” she asked, removing her hands from the bowl of bread dough with a sucking schlorp noise and moving to the sink.The blonde waitress was wringing her hands, eyes darting from the door to her boss and back again.  “The Executioner is here,” she whispered.  “In the bakery!  And she - she brought friends.”Darcy nodded, “Why don’t you take over for me in here, I’ll see what they want.”  She would never ask one of her employees to take on more than they could handle, and while “Toothsome” was well-know as a place that welcomed all - there was a reason Beth was on the daytime shift.  She’d lost two siblings and both parents to a rogue shifter, and only got to see the third sibling every other month, on orders from his Alpha.No, this was best dealt with personally.  Best case scenario: all they wanted was a bite to eat.  Worst case: all they wanted was someone to bite.  She’d heard mixed things about the Executioner.She fixed her best smile on her face before pushing the swinging doors open.  “How can I hel -Nathaniel?!”  She blinked twice at the boy - man, now - with the ridiculous red hair and purple eyes, so bright and sweet and exactly like she remembered, and then she was flinging herself over the counter, hugging him and squealing with delight.  “Nathaniel!”He slowly wound his arms around her, letting out a soft sigh.  “It is you,” he said softly, and she hugged him even tighter.Darcy registered a clicking sound and turned her head to see a short dark-haired woman slowly holstering a gun (where the fuck had that come from?!).  “I take it you know each other?” she asked, voice dry as one of Beth’s scones.“We were in a home together, me and Gregory and Darcy - before,” he answered.  “Darcy was adopted out, and we…” he shrugged.“I tried to find you!” Darcy said.  “I looked for years, until the Hills made me stop.  What - ” she pushed away, holding him at arms-length and studying his face intently.  “What happened, Natty?”“I got bit,” he said quietly, apologetically, the muscles under her hands bunching and twisting as he tensed.“Oh, Natty,” she sighed, yanking him in for another hug.  “Greg too?” she asked, voice muffled by his hair.“Yeah.”“That’s no excuse,” she told him firmly, releasing him once again.  She turned back to the counter and grabbed a marker, then turned to him again, yanking his arm out and writing her number across it as clearly as she could.  “You will call me, and you will bring Greg, and we will catch up.  Okay?  Okay.”She waited till he nodded before letting his arm go, blushing when she realized that she was being scrutinized intently by no less than five people.  Three of them were smiling, two were studying her like she was some sort of new species of strange insect, and the last - Anita Blake - just looked amused.“Well, now that that’s established - those muffins look amazing.”

Darcy stared at the computer, specifically at the cheerfully flashing cursor that was mocking her onscreen, and cursed under her breath.  Then, for good measure, she cursed a little louder.“Oh god,” Sheila said, head popping up over the edge of the shared wall of their cubicles.  “Did you - seriously?  Again, Darcy?”“I can’t help it!” she whined, finger hovering over the power button.  She pushed it, held it, then released, waiting a few seconds before turning it on again and… yeah, exact same issue.  She groaned, burying her face in her arms as she slumped over her keyboard.  “I’m going to have to call again.”“Yes, yes you are,” Sheila said matter-of-factly.  “And, maybe this time, you’ll actually get up the balls to say say something to that cute little tech whose ass you totally don’t stare at every time you fuck up the system, which is - at last count - almost every day.”“Look,” Darcy said, lifting her head, “I am almost as bad with women I like as I am with PCs.  Men and Macs are just… so much easier!”“Yeah, but I have never seen you look at anything, including your iPod when you’ve run the charge down to nil, with as much longing as you do Felicity Smoak,” Sheila pointed out.  “Also, you better call her soon, we have that project, remember?  And Irwin is on the warpath about efficiency…”“I should have taken that internship in New Mexico,” she muttered, grabbing her phone and dialing IT.  She already had Felicity’s extension memorized.  She was really that pathetic, both in her love life and her tech skills.“Darcy?” Felicity’s voice was always bright and welcoming and only sounded a little like she was laughing at her.  “Again?”“I… maybe?”“I’ll be right down.  You owe me, and Bob.”“Bob?”“The computer.”“You nicknamed it?”“Well, seeing as Bob and I share such a close, personal relationship nowadays, it felt appropriate,” Felicity informed her cheerfully.“Well, there’s not much I can do for… Bob - ” Darcy said, eyeing the computer suspiciously.  It seemed more like a ‘Fred’ to her.“Considering what you do TO him on a regular basis - ”“But I could - ” Darcy bit her lip nervously.“DO IT, DO IT NOW,” Sheila mouthed.“ - I could buy you coffee?  Sometime?”There was a loud crash over the line.“…Felicity?”“To clarify, was that like a date invite or was that you feeling like you have to make this up to me because I was actually kidding, you don’t owe me, I swear!  This is my job, and I like my job!  You don’t need to bribe me to do my job.  But if this is a date thing, well, I like you too?  I mean that in a non-harassing way where I think you’re really cute and I haven’t been leering or anything I just notice these things because I see you so often and you’re… very… noticeable?  Oh god.  Just let me - three, two, one…”“Felicity?”“…yeah?”“I like you too and I would love to get you coffee.  I mean get coffee with you!”“It’s a date,” Felicity said, and Darcy could practically hear her smile.

Darcy blinked twice.  “So, what you’re saying is I need to learn how to use the tactical weapon in my pants?”
Natasha nodded, tossing her hair over her shoulder and briefly filling Darcy’s nostrils with the bright smell of apple shampoo and the warmer, earthier tones that said ‘Omega.’  It was an appealing combination, even to other Omegas.
“Oh,” Darcy said.
The redhead smiled slowly, “There is much I could show you.”
She considered this, then extended her arms, squishing her boobs up and together.  “Pretty much always had these to get my way if wily use of wiles was necessary,” she pointed out.
Natasha’s smile went from sly to gentle in a millisecond.  “When you know how to use your natural advantages, when you have mastered them… it’s as much about knowing how not to do it.”  She pushed her hair behind her ears, ducking her head and presenting the perfect image of the shy, wallflower.  This time there was no accompanying rush of scent.
Now that was a skill Darcy would have traded her left tit for in school.
“Consider me your loyal Padawn, Master.”

Darcy would have been lying if she said she hadn’t expected him.  He sank into the seat opposite her without once making the cheap plastic creak.  In fact, if it hadn’t been for the intensity of his stare, practically burning a hole into her forehead, she might not have noticed him for some time.  She sighed, gathering herself, and set her book down before looking up.They spent nearly a full minute studying each other.  She wasn’t sure what he was looking for in her, and she didn’t know if he was disappointed.  She told herself that she didn’twant to know.  For her part, Darcy wasn’t exactly sure what she was searching for in him.  There was something indefinably softer about him, though he had lost none of his focus or fire.  Perhaps it was that he didn’t seem to carry quite as much rage as he once had in the first life she could recall.“You are shorter in this life… and caucasian,” he said at last.“And you have hair,” she returned.“But you are still the same.”The denial rushed to her lips, but she swallowed it down.  “The same in soul,” she agreed slowly, “but I’ve changed quite a bit.”“Have you?” he asked, sitting back.  There was a bitter twist to his lips and his eyes had gone dark and remote.  It was startling and more than a little disconcerting how much his facial expressions had remained the same, how easily she could read him.  It made her wonder, not for the first time, how much of Anck remained in Darcy Lewis.“I am neither the despairing wife nor the naive historian I used to be.”“Is that how you remember yourself?”“Hindsight is 20/20.”“Then tell me, Darcy Lewis, what do you wish your next self to think of the woman you are now?”She gathered her things and stood.  “That I grew, that I changed, that I didn’t make the same mistakes.  For two whole lifetimes we have brought each other pain and misery and death, isn’t that enough?  Can’t we let it end?”He leapt to his feet, and even in this life he was taller than her.  “That was not all, not evenmost of what we were,” he practically hissed.  “Tell me you feel nothing for me, tell me you have forgotten the love we shared.”Darcy firmed her jaw and looked him straight in the eye.  “I don’t love you.”He smirked and, faster than she could pull away, drew her in and pressed his lips to hers.  His body might not know hers, but he learned quickly and the knowledge he did have of her was soul-deep.  His mouth moved slowly over hers, coaxing and teasing until she responded, then sinking into a pattern of slow, deep, bone-melting kisses that left her trembling and gasping in his arms.She shivered, pressing her forehead to his shoulder as she tried to will her knees to steadiness.“Darcy,” he said, and his voice in her ear, soft and filled with triumph, set off her trembling anew, “I don’t believe you.”

RAMI MALEK AS REINCARNATED!IMHOTEP


Your OTP decides to go all in and make it "Facebook official." Unfortunately, the couple changed their relationship status on April Fools Day, and now it's been months and all of their friends still think that everything's a joke.



“I blame you,” Darcy said moodily.Clint opened his mouth, outrage writ large across his face, then paused.  “That’s… probably fair, actually,” he admitted.“Fix it,” she told him.  “Sam keeps trying to set me up with his army buddies and even my father still thinks you’re ‘just a friend.’  Look, it wouldn’t bother me so much but it’s been months and eventually, when the wedding invitations go out, we need them to actually RSVP.”“I know, I know…  Wait, wedding?!”



Soulmates + differing lifespans + reincarnation = the following is a sad headcanon, you have been warned.
Chapter Summary
This is half-fic, half-headcanon, half-prompt(?).  YES, I KNOW THAT'S THREE HALVES.  IDC.




Imagine a universe where, if you are alive at the same time as your soulmate, you will receive some sort of indentifying mark on your skin that represents them.  It can be an image, a word, anything: marks vary greatly in size, placement, color, texture, etc.  It represents the totality of the other individual’s being and touching it gives you a general sense of the person that they are.  It’s like literally carrying a tiny piece of their soul around and it means that even if you never meet, you still know they’re out there and - in a sense - you know them.
In the (MCU) universe there exists a wide variety of species with varying lifespans.  Everything from short-lived Midgardians to practically immortal personifications of abstract concepts and the wide spectrum in between.  Some souls/ abstract collections of specific energy/ people are born, die, and then live again, though not all species are aware of this (especially those with a much shorter comparative lifespan).

There are a lot of ways this could play out.  Lets look at two of them!

Option 1, in which one soul is born a mutant.
When the Wolverine is found by Xavier’s people, they discover that he is littered with soulmarks.  At first glance they look like tattoos, but they are all too sharp, too finely detailed, to be anything but the marks of matched souls.
When he wakes, he tells them that he doesn’t know a damn thing about most of them.  The majority came from Before, and he cannot recall if he ever met them.  Three are more recent and he knows at least some of the story behind them: the first is a faded dragon that, he assures them with a bitter smile, once sparkled with all the colors of flame; the second is a wolverine wrapped around his wrist, with face tilted up towards the sky - it faded even as he watched the very first time he remembers waking up.
There’s a third mark, one in vivid detail, but he guards it jealously and refuses to tell them when it appeared.  It’s enough that he remembers when it appeared, that he knows that she’s out there.  He’s not sure how many of the old marks are hers, but it doesn’t matter in the end because he knows that she’s alive, and somewhere, and he will find her.
Option 2, in which one soul is born of Asgard.
Thor was barely a hundred when his soulmark appeared.  His mother was pleased, as was his father - until Odin touched his son’s mark and was able to divine that Thor’s ‘mate had been born of Midgard.  He refused to let Frigga take Thor to Midgard to look for his match and felt thoroughly vindicated when the mark faded a scant three days later.
Thor was utterly heartbroken and convinced that if he’d but been there, he would have found a way to save his mate.
Fifty-odd years later, Odin again felt justified when Thor burst into the council chamber, full of joy that his ‘mate had reincarnated.  He had been blessed with a second mark, different in small ways from the first, but he remembered how it had felt and he knew that it was the same soul - changed, as all are changed by life - but substantially the same and still his perfect ‘mate.  Again, Odin was dismayed to find that Thor’s mate had been born of Midgard, and again he refused to allow Thor to go to the other realm.  This time Thor’s mate lasted nearly thirty years before dying.
Thor was inconsolable for a full decade.  Yes, his ‘mate had come back, but they had changed.  What if, even if they did return, they were so changed that they were no longer his ‘mate?  What if he had lost his chance?
The third time Thor’s ‘mate was born, Thor solemnly presented his case before his father: he was of age, a full 450 years old, a warrior in his own right.  He could take care of himself, he would be safe venturing to Midgard, he would find his ‘mate and return with them.
Odin refused, citing unrest in the realms, and essentially gave Thor a series of labors: do this, and you can go to Midgard.  Fix this problem, and you can go to Midgard.  Halt this civil war and you can go to Midgard.  By the time Thor had completed all the assigned tasks, his ‘mate had grown old and died.
Thor didn’t tell anyone the fourth time his ‘mate returned, but his behavior grew more reckless.  For twenty years he nursed his grudge and cherished the small mark that unequivocally proved he was not alone.  He chafed at the All-Father’s restrictions, and when the opportunity presented itself, he leapt at the chance to thwart him.
…and was banished to Midgard for his disobedience.
FOR ADDED SAD!
Imagine Natasha, young and hopeful, picked up by the Red Room.
They train her to kill the one who matches her Mark.
 
(He is young and sweet, a student she meets on an op in Tripoli.  He buys her mhalbiya.  “A sweet thing for a sweet thing,” he says, winking, and then he blushes at his own daring and Natasha is hopelessly charmed.)
 
She does.
Eight years later, she gets a new Mark, and despairs.



63-: “Y'know, nobody is going to know I’m your omega if you don’t mark me as yours.”



“You know I don’t believe in that shit,” Darcy said, exasperated. “Look. Babe. I know you basically slept through the second through fourth waves of the alignment revolution, but that kind of thing is just kind of…” She shrugged, grimacing.Steve sighed deeply, “Not even if I’m the one asking for it?”She shrugged again, “I mean, that makes a difference, yeah, but WHY do you want it?”“Eileen in tech dev is kind of pushy with her scent,” he began slowly, almost reluctantly, but if Darcy had been looking for it she would have caught the tell-tale gleam in his eyes that spelled trouble.Instead, suddenly the only thing Darcy could see was Eileen, with her big red hair and her spicy scent, all over Steve.“It would just be nice to carry something of you around,” Steve finished, a plaintive note entering his voice.Darcy stood, stalked over to him and tugged on his head until he bent for her, then she proceeded to rub her face and wrists all over his neck, pushing all of her feelings for the man OUT and UP until she was satisfied.“Good enough?” she asked, stepping back.His eyes were glazed and his breathing rough. “Y-yeah, think that’ll tide me over.”



Hmmm, how about: 8- : “Look at your neck. Look at the marks I left. You are mine. And solely mine.”

Go watch this video, and THEN read the fic.  You’re welcome.

Oddly enough, if it had been an option, Darcy totally would have won “most likely to volunteer for an arranged marriage in order to promote peace between an alien realm and Earth” in high school.  Then again, she’d gone to a pretty odd school.  Still, though this was the path she’d ended up choosing, it wasn’t exactly her ideal.  He wasn’t her ideal.He was staring at her from across the room while Steve said… something.Every time she looked up, he was watching her.  He wasn’t close enough for her to smell him, and she was still learning the various scents that indicated his moods, so it wasn’t like it would help.  She wished she knew what he was thinking.  There was something about the way he watched her that made her stomach feel light and heavy at the same time.“How’s married life treating you so far?” Tony asked, interrupting her reverie.  The easy smile on his face was at odds with the very real concern in his eyes.“It’s been an hour, Tony,” she pointed out.“Yeah, I know, but - ” his eyes dipped down to the fresh bite marks there, already healed into scars by nifty Asgardian magic-science, then away.  “Look, kid, this doesn’t have to - I mean you can still - ”“I’m still welcome in your ivory tower, even with the ball and chain?”“Exactly,” he said, clearly relieved.  “Mi casa es su casa and all that.”“While I’m sure she appreciates the thought, I am more than capable of providing a home for my mate,” Loki said voice so smooth that you could almost miss the sharpness.  He had appeared suddenly, just at her shoulder, and Darcy was smart enough to realize that magic had definitely been involved.“Thank you, Tony,” Darcy said, ignoring the way she could feel Loki bristling at her side.  “I will definitely keep that in mind.”  She smiled at the scientist and then barely had a second to recognize the sheer fury pouring off of Loki, from his bared teeth to his suddenly-acidic scent, before he was whisking her away.  Great, she thought, more magic.It was almost like a powerpoint wipe: one second they were in the main hall, the next they were in a luxurious set of quarters - den, her mind helpfully supplied - and Loki was crowding her up against a wall.“We are barely an hour bound and already you entertain another’s suit?” he growled, planting his hands on the wall to either side of her head.Darcy ignored the warmth spreading through her limbs.  It was panic, not… okay, yeah, some part of her was totally digging this.  She could be honest with herself.  “You’re kidding, right?” she asked.“He offers you his home - ”“All of the Avengers live there!”The way Loki’s lip curled, almost a snarl, told her that had not been the right tactic.  “You are not theirs to care for, you are mine.”Darcy’s hand rose involuntarily, fingers barely brushing the edge of the mark on her neck.  Her eyes dropped down to Loki’s neck, where he bore the evidence of her teeth.  “Tony wasn’t disputing that,” she explained, “he was telling me that - that - ”  That if this doesn’t work out, I’ll still have a home.Loki lifted one hand and, with a flick of his wrist, pulled a mirror from… somewhere.  He tilted it, offering her a view of herself: eyes wide and cheeks flushed, brand new silvery scars at the juncture of her neck and shoulder.“Look at your neck. Look at the marks I left. You are mine. And solely mine.  Mine to care for, mine to protect, and mine to keep.”Darcy reached out and laid a hand over her marks on his neck, feeling something dark and warm curl through her as his eyes fluttered shut and he shuddered under her touch. “I will only be as much yours as you are mine,” she said, and she’d meant it as a warning but it came out a promise.



43-: “I will only claim you as my omega if you love me.” This seemed really angsty to me.

Darcy shivered at the Beast’s words, just as she did every night.  “I don’t love you,” she said, just as she did every night.  Then, for the first time: “I’m sorry,” she said quietly, looking down at her hands folded in her lap.The monstrous Alpha sighed, and he was so large that a sigh from him stirred the hair all over her head.  “I understand,” he told her.  He folded his napkin carefully and set it on the table.  It was strange to see such a creature so dextrous, his mismatched paws - one furred, one metal - took such care with the cloth.  “Will you join me tomorrow night?” he asked, another part of their ritual.She nodded.“Until tomorrow then,” the Beast said.

Yes, the beast is Bucky.


24.“I can’t understand you alphas and omegas, smelling each other like you were meat.”



Clint shot her an unamused look.  “Really?”“Really,” she returned, flopping over on the couch to look at him.  Even upside down (her, not him) she could see how done he was with the conversation already.  “It’s like… ruts and heats are when the meat is, you know, done, everything up to that point is checking for the doneness.”The archer scrubbed a hand over his face.  “Jane hugs you,” he said abruptly.  “Every morning and whenever you bring her food.  She always hugs you.”“Yeah…?”“You’re both betas, and it’s completely unconscious, but it’s still a scent thing.  You smell like each other and she’s… reaffirming pack bonds.”Darcy frowned, considering this.  “Wait, is that why Natasha started playing with my hair?  Is that a scent thing?”“Nat’s doing what?!”“Playing with my hair.  She always finds me before you guys go on a mission and braids it, it’s great, means I never have to style it the next day.”“Yeah, Darcy, it’s definitely a scent thing.  And you should probably talk to her about it because I sure as shit am not prepared to take on that role for either one of you!”  With that, he stood and left, muttering dire things under his breath the whole way.She flopped back over so she was right side up and addressed the ceiling.  “When do you think he’ll figure out we’ve been fucking for months?”Natasha silently slithered down from the vent she’d been using as a hiding place, settling behind Darcy on the couch and curling her arm around the younger woman’s waist.  She buried her face in the brunette’s hair and inhaled deeply, smiling.  “Clint’s specialty has always been seeing things from a distance.”



11. "You, the alpha, are cooking for me?" and Darcy as the alpha of cooking plEASe



Darcy rolled her eyes, “Who do you think fed Jane, Tony?”“Take out,” he said instantly.“Two years of take out and we’d be big as houses, Jane’s crazy metabolism notwithstanding.  I cook, I’m an alpha who cooks, you wanna make something of it, omega who invents?”Tony opened his mouth, then shut it, then opened it to say, “No?”“Good choice, never insult the cook,” she advised, carefully flipping the omelet from the pan to the plate in front of him.He poked it with a fork for just long enough that she was on the cusp of feeling insulted, then took a huge bite.  “Thith ith good!” he said, sounding surprised.Darcy grabbed a plate and started prepping her own omelet.  “I’m an alpha of many talents,” she said dryly.



70-: “I got into some trouble today. I sort of punched an Alpha in the face when he touched me. Long story short, there’s a couple of officers at the door who would like to talk to you about getting control of your omega.”

It was interesting to see Sam go from relaxed and easy-going to alert and battle-ready in seconds.  Darcy’s posture softened in reaction as he stood slowly, eyes going to the door behind her.“They there now?”“Yup.”“Will you please go into the dining room?” he asked her gently.She nodded and headed past him towards the dining room, making sure she brushed by close enough to feel his warmth and get some of his scent on her clothes.  He grabbed her as she moved past and pulled her into a hug, which she immediately relaxed into.  Sam was obnoxiously good at reading her, he really was the perfect Alpha.  Sometimes, in weaker moments, she wished that he was her Alpha, but they were just roommates.  She shouldn’t hope for more than that when what they already had was so good.“I’ll take care of this, and then we’ll order pizza and watch trashy tv, okay?”Fuck it, I need this, Darcy decided, and snuggled closer.  “That sounds perfect, thank you.”

SO MUCH PININGMUTUAL PINING


21: [Public place] Stay calm. I think I just started my heat.



Steve’s head whipped around so quickly that Darcy winced in sympathy for his neck.  “Youwhat?” he whisper-shouted.“You heard me the first time,” she said calmly.He looked around wildly, as if hoping that a secure bunker would magically appear out of mid-air.  They were in the middle of a street festival, one Sam had recommended and Steve had allowed himself to be persuaded to attend, mostly because it was in Brooklyn and a good excuse to go visit his old stomping grounds without getting all maudlin over it.  He took a few deep breaths, and Darcy was pretty sure he was counting to ten, before gently wrapping his hand around her wrist and turning to lead her away from all of the people and (hopefully) towards a taxi.“It’s kind of your fault,” she pointed out.Steve stopped abruptly, twisting to stare at her in incredulous outrage, “MY fault?  How is this - ?”“You’ve been feeding me all afternoon,” she said.“I haven’t - ”“And you totally growled at that guy who asked if I wanted ketchup with my hot dog,” she reminded him.“It wasn’t that he asked it was how he looked at you,” Steve said darkly.“You knew I was close, today just… pushed it over the edge.”He looked stricken, “I am so sorry, Darcy…”“Relax,” she said, smiling.  She pushed up on her toes to whisper in his ear, “So long as you get me back to our rooms and feed your knot to - ”  She burst out laughing as he didn’t even let her finish, just turned and started jogging towards the roadblocks, towing her along behind.



70, with Darcy/Deadpool (no I don't have an obsession with this ship officer, what are you talking about) if only because Deadpool's reaction would be hiliarious



“I got into some trouble today. I sort of punched an Alpha in the face when he touched me. Long story short, there’s a couple of officers at the door who would like to talk to you about getting control of your omega.”Wade stared at her, completely motionless for a full five seconds.  “Who touched you?” he finally asked, and his voice was calm, but it was his I am planning fun and games and dismemberment will be key to both voice.“It doesn’t matter,” she said, waving that off.  “I handled it, and unfortunately there were police types nearby so I need you to go explain to them that you don’t need to,” she curled her lip, “talk to me about my anger issues, okay?”He tugged his mask down and -Oh shit.  “Don’t hurt them, Wade!  They’re just doing their jobs!” - grabbed a katana, giving it a whistling swing through the air before he headed for the door.  “So was Hitler!  I mean Eichmann!  You know - the one with the awful excuses for the war crimes, right?”“They’re not war criminals, Wade!”“No, just assholes,” he agreed, swinging the door open with a manic grin.  “Eveninggentlemen, please tell me how I can help you today.  In detail.”The officers took one look at the mask, exchanged nervous glances, and started backing down the hall.  “No help necessary, sir.  Really,” the older one said.  “Things are well in hand.”“Thank you for your time,” the younger one babbled.  As soon as they reached a bend, they turned and Wade could hear them sprinting away.  With his enhanced hearing he could hear one officer say, “Of course she’s dating a fucking mask, figures.  All the hot ones are crazy or taken.”“Or both,” the other agreed.Wade turned to find Darcy standing in their kitchen, hands fisted at her hips and one eyebrow raised expectantly.  “Well?” she asked.  “Solved?”Crazy, taken, and all mine, he thought to himself cheerily, thanks, amuse!

You’re welcome, Wade.





60-: “Be a good Omega and bend over.”



Bruce gave Tony a look so dry you could garnish it with an olive. “Truly, the world wept the day you decided not to go into medicine.”Tony grinned, “Right? Now, seriously, bend over. I made the tracking nanos as small as I could, but this is still a peanut butter shot at best, your ass is the best place for it, so…” He quirked a brow and twirled his finger in the air.

The semester had only just begun, which was why Bucky was surprised to hear muffled groans followed by two loud thumps echoing down the hall from Steve’s office.  Steve looked forward to the beginning of the semester with a masochist’s fervor, excited about all the young minds to mold, while Bucky had settled into cynicism during his undergrad years and never saw fit to leave.  Sounds of distress didn’t usually grace their floor until midway through the semester when the freshmen realized they’d tanked their grades and the seniors started panicking about final projects.  Duly concerned, Bucky scooted his wheely-chair (a recent spoil of the ongoing war twixt hard and soft sciences) out of his office and down the hall to gently knock on Steve’s door.There was a muffled groan in answer.Bucky paused, pursing his lips as he considered.  There was always a chance, slim though it might be, that he might find his friend in a compromising position, but - well, it wouldn’t exactly be the first time.  He pushed the door open and wheeled in, finding Steve’s office preternaturally pristine as per usual, save for a small pile of books tumbled about one corner of his desk - likely the source of that first thump.  Steve was sitting at his desk with his forehead planted firmly in the center of a stack of syllabi.He would bet cash money that that was the source of the second thump.“It’s… only just now past eleven - little early to be calling the day a wash,” Bucky said.  “What’s wrong?”  Steve did not smell particularly angry or sad, no, he smelled of general upset and… a great deal of embarrassment?“I’m going to need to ask you a favor,” Steve said miserably.  He sat up and scrubbed his hands over his face, mussing his usually immaculately-kept beard.  “I need you to take over grading my Wednesday seminar.  I can’t - it wouldn’t be ethical - ”  He sighed, looking so pathetic that Bucky almost agreed to do it on the spot, no questions asked.Almost.  Long exposure to Steve’s puppy eyes built a tolerance.  Bucky waited patiently for him to continue, brows raised expectantly.“There’s… this student,” Steve began haltingly.“Historical revisionist, Holocaust denier?  Give me something to go on, here.”“She smells like my ma’s lemon surprise pie.”Bucky sat back in his chair, “Huh.”  He considered it for a second, then stood and gave the blond a hearty clap on the back.  “Congratulations!  So, you think you’ll shoot for a summer wedding?  That’ll give you all of spring semester to court her.”Steve groaned again, slumping forward and burying his hands in his face.“I’ll just let myself out, then.  Remember, you’ve got a two-thirty!”  Bucky shook his head as he wheeled back to his own office, thanking his lucky stars yet again that he’d been lucky enough to be born a beta, and didn’t have to deal with that sort of -There was someone in his office.Someone who smelled like rum raising bread pudding.“Hi,” the unfairly attractive man said, offering his hand to shake.Bucky took it on autopilot, and it was warm and fascinatingly calloused.“Sorry about the late notice, the budget only just went through: I’m Sam Wilson, your TA for the semester.”Oh no, Bucky thought hopelessly, he’s beautiful.

Pre-rut make-outs were some of the best kinds of make-outs.  10/10, Darcy approved, would mash faces again.  She hummed low in her throat as Bucky started trailing kisses down the line of her jaw to her neck.  They’d been kissing for… it felt like hours, at this point.  Slow, sweet kisses that made her feel safe and cherished and warm.  Hungry, deep kisses that made her heart race and her toes curl.  All of the kisses, all for her.Bucky made a rumbly sound that trailed off into a sharp curse when she scratched her nails down the back of his neck, bracketing his spine.  He rocked into her and - hello!  She’d known he was hard, but… her brain shorted out as he did it again and she whimpered, nails digging into his neck again, but this time to hold on.“God, doll, you smell - your smell is… intoxicating. If I stay I’m going to knot you,” he confessed, voice gone rough as delivered the warning.  “You said you weren’t ready, so I gotta go.  I’ll ride it out in my apartment.”“Ride it out?” Darcy asked, quirking a brow.“Don’t be cute,” he said, then he dropped a quick kiss on the tip of her nose and rolled off of her and onto the floor.  He grabbed his shoes and put them back on, all while watching her as she lay there and watched him right back.“Gonna think of me?” Darcy asked, linking her hands and lifting them above her head to stretch just so.Bucky coughed to cover his involuntary growl.  “What do you think?”“I think that I’ll probably need to do some ‘riding’ of my own, once you’re gone.  My whole apartment smells like you,” she said.  She took a deep breath and sighed happily.  “Think of me, thinking of you…” Darcy gave him a slow wink and a lascivious grin.This time he couldn’t mask the sound he made.  “See you in a few days, be thinking of you, doll.”“Likewise, soldier.”

“I’d kill to be a beta right now,” Darcy grumbled, hugging the wall with all her might while the upper muckity-mucks of the hero set schmoozed and gabbed and generally attempted to act like civilized human beings capable of interaction outside of a martial context.It was not going well.The problem was that each team (pack, though few would admit it) had a good vibe going, whatever that vibe might be.  The X-Men, for instance, were mostly omegas while the Avengers skewed beta and (surprise, surprise) most of the loner-type heroes who’d showed up were alphas.  It was a volatile combination and Darcy deeply regretted showing up to witness it.  She’d intended to come as moral support for Jane, but the tiny scientist had absconded with one of the X-people about fifteen minutes in (Ilyana?  Ionna?  Something like that…), leaving Darcy all by her lonesome and desperately hoping she’d be able to keep out of the hormone stew.“What’s such a belle dame doing in such a shady corner?” a smooth voice asked, making her startle and nearly spill her drink.Darcy looked up into the red-on-black eyes of Remy Lebeau: X-Man, thief, and  notoriously flirtatious omega, and lost her train of thought for a second because he smelled amazing.  She wanted to lean in and inhale and figure out every nuance of his scent - oh no, hell no.  Darcy gave him a very fake smile and started backing away.  “No idea really, I must be lost, I should go now, bye!” she babbled.“Has Remy done something to offend?” he asked, sounding genuinely curious.“Nooooo,” she said, still edging away.  “I’m just tired.  And I have a headache.  I should go take something for that.  Nowish.”He squinted at her suspiciously and then - holy crap, he could move very quickly when he wanted to - swooped over and wrapped his hand around her arm, lowering his face instead of lifting her hand so that he could inhale just above the delicate blue veins of her wrist.  “Alpha,” he hummed appreciatively.  “Why cover such a lovely smell with so much beta perfume?”“You’re kidding, right?  Have you looked at this crowd?  The last thing they need is another sparky element in this powder keg.”“Why come at all, then?” Remy asked.  He still had her wrist and had graduated from holding her arm to gently stroking his thumb across her palm and it was very distracting.“Moral support,” Darcy said.  “Can I have my hand back now?”“Loyal,” he said, nodding approvingly.  “And non, I think not.”She stared up at him and tugged.  “Please?” she asked, somewhat at a loss.  She really hadn’t expected him to care enough to put up a fight.“You are the most interesting person in this room,” he declared.  “And I am bored.  Bad things happen when I am bored, ma belle.”“I believe you,” Darcy muttered.“And I am thinking you would like this evening to go well?”“Ideally, yes,” she agreed slowly, not sure where this was going.“Then you must stay and entertain me!”That’s where it was going.  Fantastic.  “And how am I going to do that?”He grinned at her and there was a noticeable twinkle in his eye.  “Oh, Remy is sure that, if we put our heads together, we will think of something.”
I’m in trouble.

Chapter Summary
@ozhawkauthor I am only writing this because it popped into my head, fully-formed and obnoxious, almost as soon as I finished reading your request.  WHY DO THIS TO ME, OZ?  WHY SMUT?  WHY?



Wade - Deadpool - never stopped talking.  Ever.  It was a given, and something Darcy had always enjoyed about him.  He could keep up with her, and he was always lively, in spite of some of his strangeness (sometimes because of it) he was a lot of fun to be around.  It was that last that had led her here, to her current position: knotted and tied with him until further notice and a captive audience to whatever thought crossed his mind and then, inevitably, came out of his mouth.At the moment his thoughts were filthy and entirely focused on her.“Even before they went and played Operation with my insides and my outsides,” he was rambling as he played with her hair, “I always had great stamina.”  He punctuated that last word with a gentle roll of his hips, making Darcy arch back into him and gasp.  They were lying on their sides on the bed, her back to his front, with their legs tangled.  At some point he had twisted a little so he could prop himself on one elbow.She was pretty sure he was braiding her hair and she gave it even odds that he was shaping her curls into obscenities.  It wouldn’t even be the first time.“But now…” Wade curled one arm over her side and reached up to curve his hand around her breast.  “Now… I could literally fuck you for hours and never get tired of the way youfeel.”  He was rocking into her steadily now, shifting his knot back and forth inside of her and making her central nervous system feel like the Fourth of July.“I - ahn!” Darcy whined, one hand scrabbling back behind her so she could dig her nails into his ass.  “I’d get tired eventually,” she gasped.“Oh, pixie stick,” he cooed affectionately, leaning down to murmur in her ear: “I’ll do all the work.  You just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride…”



Lord of the Prompts
Chapter Summary
First sentence of a fic. (longest sentence ever). Darcy should have known at that point to give any portal that Jane had created a wide birth, and she had tried, but had managed to get sucked in anyway, spiraling into a swirl of lights and landing with a thud in a very strange, very unfamiliar place. (NOW GO CRAZY! ANYWHERE YOU WANT!)

She sat up very slowly because she was dizzy.  When she’d finally levered herself up onto her elbows, she found herself faced with a perplexed-looking old man in a pointy slate gray hat sitting on a log not ten feet away.
“Well,” he said, “I certainly wasn’t expecting you.”
Darcy quirked a brow at him: “What were you expecting?”
“Based on prior experience, I rather expected a Hobbit.”

"That's an odd place for a duck to be."



Darcy looked down at herself and internally blanched.  She’d answered her door in her underwear because Jane, Thor, and Erik had been her only visitors (until now), and none of them particularly cared whether she wore pants or not.  Unfortunately, Tony Stark had broken that streak and was now staring rather avidly at her “Five Nights At Freddy’s” underpants.“That’s Chica,” she explained, and then mentally kicked herself because why would he know that?!“You named it… Chica?” he asked slowly, eyes never once straying from the anthropomorphic duck adorning her crotch.“The duck!  Not my - ” she rubbed a hand over her face and sighed deeply.  “Is there something I can help you with, Tony?”“Well, there was.  I can’t remember it now.”

“It means there’re a lot of things we still don’t know,” Jane said tiredly, helping the other brunette rise from the sandy dune they’d landed on.“You just warped us into a field and - ” Darcy looked around, lips pursing.  Then she looked up and her jaw dropped.  “Jane.  Jane,” she poked the scientist.  “Jane - there are two moons.”Jane looked up at the sky and her face rapidly cycled through several different emotions before settling on - “Well, shit.”

“Where there’s a will, there’s a way,” Jane replied, looking grimly determined.“Yeah, but there’s no way that’s gonna fit without causing major structural damage.  Trust me, I know, my aunt and uncle are dentists.”“I should be able to stretch…”“Yeah, but you gotta worry about lockjaw and not biting down.”Jane nodded.  “Maybe we could shrink it?”“Will it be as effective?”She shrugged, “It’s worth a shot.  Even reduced a fraction, it should still be more than enough to get me there.”

He offered her a charming grin, “Well, technically - ”Darcy clapped her hand over his mouth (a bit of a stretch as he was a good ten inches taller than her), smiled brightly, and said, “Wasn’t expecting him.  We have things to discuss.  See you later, Janie!”  Then proceeded to drag him out the door, round the corner, and into the alley at the back of the building, whereupon she shoved him up against the wall and fixed him with her fiercest glare.“It is good to see you,” Vlad said gently.“What are you doing here, father?”

“Technically, mon cher, I did not ‘growl.’”Darcy gave him an unimpressed look.  “That flashy thing you do with your eyes when you’re trying to be intimidating?  Totally counts, Remy.”  She did not startle as she felt the faint pinprick of clawed digits settling at her waist, but she did roll her eyes.  “Victor…”“What?  I’m not growling,” he said reasonable, pulling her into his arms and wrapping himself around her like a particularly muscular and multi-limbed anaconda.“Victor - Remy - I’m going to the benefit,” Darcy said firmly.  She immediately felt the rumble of a growl starting in Victor’s chest, while Remy’s eyes flared red in response to her comment.  “I’m going to support Jane, my best friend, the lead speaker, remember?”“There have been threats - ” Remy began.“You were the threats!  You were the ones who were hired to grab Jane!”“But we may not have been the only ones, ma belle.”  He reached out to cradle her cheek in his hand, “We have only just found you, do you wish to leave us so quickly?”Darcy threw up her hands in exasperation, nearly clipping Victor in the face.  “Fine!  If you’re that worried, you can escort me - us - and keep us safe.  There, happy?”Victor nuzzled her neck, the rumbly growl turning into something softer and steadier that definitely reminded her of a purr.  “Satisfied,” he said, his breath against her skin making her shiver.  She felt him smile, his teeth lightly pressing into her neck for the barest fraction of a second.  “For now…”

"What's the *real* story behind your nickname?" Darcy asked him, absently curling a strand of her long brown around her finger.



Pietro could not seem to take his eyes off of that one lock and the way it wound around her finger.  “I - what?”  He looked back up into her eyes, saw the amusement there, and blushed a fiery red.  “What was the question?”“Your nickname, Quicksilver - is it just because of the hair?”  She punctuated her question by reaching up and tugging on a lock of hair that had a tendency to resist all attempts to style it, always ending up falling over his forehead.He swallowed hard.  “Yes, because of my hair.  And I am fast.”Darcy’s hand strayed over his head, her fingers carding into his hair and making Pietro sigh and lean into the touch, his eyes falling closed.  “I suppose Cheetah was taken,” she mused.That made him open his eyes.  “What?”  She had not stopped petting him, he rather hoped she never would.“Because you’re kind of like a cat?  And fast?  You know, Thundercats?”He continued to stare at her blankly.Darcy clicked her tongue.  “All right, speedster, come with me.  I’m going to show you Thundercats, and then the meaning of the phrase ‘Netflix and chill.’”Pietro had no idea what that meant, but the gleam in her eyes made him think he’d enjoy finding out.



First sentence: No one was as surprised as Darcy was when the villain of the day suddenly got down on one knee and declared eternal love for her.

Deadpool leapt over a car to dodge a repulsor blast from Iron Man and landed not ten feet from where Darcy was crouched behind a taxi.  She held very, very still, working under the theory that if she didn’t move then he couldn’t see her.  Likening Deadpool to a t-rex made sense in her head.She watched him look about, considering his options, before he started to move right - towards Esmerelda’s.  Darcy’s brain went through a series of rapid calculations involving routes through the city, cost of reconstruction, and how many fucks she was willing to give before she took a deep breath, stepped out from behind her cover, and did the stupidest thing she’d ever done: deliberately caught the attention of the deadly, katana-wielding mercenary with definite mental issues.“Hey!” she yelled.  “Get your sorry ass away from Esmerelda’s!  I am not letting your stupid superhero shit wreck the best chimichanga joint in the city!”Deadpool froze at her first words, spinning to face her with both swords out and up.  He’d sheathed them by the time the word ‘not’ left her lips, and he was standing directly in front of her by the end of her impromptu warning, looming over her with an obvious frown on his face.“I don’t recognize you,” he said.“We’ve never met,” she said dryly.“No, no,” Deadpool said, waving his hand.  “I mean you’re new.  To the canon.”  He sighed deeply, “Nevermind.  The important thing is!  You like Mexican food?”“Um, yes?”“Enough to risk your life to save it?”“Clearly.”He nodded, then fell to one knee before her, clasping one of her hands between his.  “Marry me,” he said solemnly.“Um…”A well-aimed repulsor blast knocked him away from her, and Darcy went back to hiding behind the taxi until the Avengers had driven him off.  She assumed that that would be the last she would see of the mouthy mercenary.  After all, how often would she be out on the streets during a fight?  And he wouldn’t remember her anyways.She was deeply, deeply wrong about that last.

Jane followed quickly on her heels, clutching a small device that was flashing in several ominous shades of red.Clint looked at Tony, then flipped one of his exploding arrows out of its quiver.  “How do you like your chicken, Tin Man?  Fried or broiled?”Tony aimed a repulsor blast at the closest chick.  “Roasted!  Hey, Thor, your girlfriend broke physics again.”“It appears she has made a breakthrough,” the Asgardian corrected.“You say potato, I say - ”  He blasted three more chicks in rapid succession.  “I am not eating any birds for at least a month.  Thanksgiving is ruined.”

Jane stared, flabbergasted.  “But that’s… that’s just awful.”“And holiday-themed,” Darcy chirped, grabbing her friend’s arm and gently tugging her out of the way of a standing pedestrian as they made their way back to the Tower.  “Now you know why I freak out this time of year.  It could happen at any moment, really.  My money’s on the Christmas party this weekend, here’s hop - ”There was an explosion just across the street, sending both women to the ground out of instinct.  They stared as a hubcap rolled into view on its edge, slowed, then gently rattled to a stop just before them.  Almost simultaneously, there was a gentle whirring sound and a distinctive laugh as the Goblin floated into view.  Darcy grabbed Jane’s hand blindly, squeezing in a way she hoped communicated - GET YOUR PANIC BUTTON, NOW!“Wrecking a restaurant during lunchtime rush, what kind of monster are you?” a male voice quipped and yup, right on time, that was the red-and-blue form of Spider-Man flipping into view.Goblin cackled, then - oh shit - seemed to notice that they had an audience.  “They served me a shitty Eggs Benedict,” he told the superhero, then turned to the two women on the ground.  “And there’s nothing like chrome for the hollandaise…”He swooped toward them and Darcy immediately shoved Jane out of the way, ensuring that if he was aiming for a hostage - oh, great - he wouldn’t get her friend.  She ‘oofed’ quietly as she was lifted from the ground by the back of her coat and drawn onto the hover-glider.  One arm was swiftly banded around her waist, keeping her arms to her sides and leaving her pinned.She weighed her words very carefully, waiting until he was level again before saying:  “I swear to god, if you drop me I will haunt you until the end of your days.”  Darcy wheezed as the arm around her tightened again before releasing.  She was then treated to a rapid descent onto the street, where she was very gently set down and then the Goblin was spinning her around, both of his hands on her shoulders, leaving her face-to-mask.“Your name,” he demanded.“None of your business,” she spat.“You’re my - ” he was cut off as a web caught on his arm and yanked, pulling him away from her.Darcy took the opportunity to flee, sprinting for cover as fast as her shaky legs could go.  My soulmate is a supervillain who dresses up as a fucking goblin and loves puns.  What the hell did I do in my last life to deserve this?

Darcy glanced up from watching her favorite hacker/girlfriend/baking partner/all of the above draw lazy circles on her feet to the stunned faces around them, "What? You people do know I have a degree right? Why do you look so surprised when I say smart shit?"“I think it’s less the ‘smart shit’ and more the girlfriend, actually,” Jane said dryly.  She walked around the couch to lean down and hug Chloe.  “It’s good to see you again.”“Good to be here again,” Chloe said, smiling sunnily.  “Nice job on that stabilizing matrix, Victor says I’ll be able to come through whenever I want, now, and Darcy can visit me too!”“Hold up,” Tony said.  “Stabilizing matrix?  Is that why you wanted the - ”“Yes.  Chloe popped through during that thing with the Elves.  Thor was able to help us send her back after a few weeks, but she and Darcy…”“For the record, I think ‘interdimensional girlfriends’ nets us an auto-win for longest long-distance relationship ever,” Darcy said, smirking.

“To be fair,” Jane said, wide-eyed and shaking a little as she stared at the wand in her hand.  “I’m dating a god and I’m still surprised.”  She took a deep breath then very carefully gripped the wand by the handle and held it out to Darcy.  “Your turn, you try.”“It’s the wand that chooses the wizard,” Ollivander put in, clearly disapproving.  “If you would like to attempt to match your friend here, she should have her own wand.”“Fine, I’ll just… sit here, then,” Jane said.  She sank into one of the chairs by the door, staring at the wand in her hands and mouthing what Darcy thought might be equations.“Well, Ms. Lewis?  You do not have to try if you don’t wish to,” Professor McGonagall said kindly.  “Both you and your friend come from a world without magic, it might even be best not to waken it.  There’s no guarantee it will still be there when you return.”Darcy bit her lip, considering.  “Where Jane goes, I follow,” she said after a moment.  “Besides, magic?  Real magic?  I’d be an idiot to pass up this chance.”  She spun to face Ollivander, hand outstretched, “Wand me.”

Darcy’s lip curled involuntarily.  “Pot,” she said, pointing at him, “meet kettle,” she continued, pointing at herself.  “Oh, oh, and also - go fuck yourself.”Tony’s jaw clenched.  “Look, I know we haven’t always had the best relationship… or any relationship at all, really.  But - BUT!  I need you to take this seriously.  ULTRON went rogue, JARVIS is - is gone, and I just - I need to know that you’re safe.  Please, just - ”The connection crackled abruptly going fuzzy and wobbly before reforming into something new: instead of seeing her biological father Darcy was confronted with the creepy robot visage of ULTRON.“Hello, Darcy,” he said.  “Or should I call you sister?”

Darcy cracked her eyes open slowly and - yep - she was still in the lab, so what was the source of the mysterious petting?  She sat up slowly, groaning as she cracked her neck - a night sleeping at her desk was never good.There was a soft ‘boop’ that trailed up at the end in a questioning manner, then Dum-E’s arm came into view, patting her hand instead of her head this time.  The ‘bot let out a series of quiet beeps and chirrups, continuing to pat her hand.“Hey, buddy,” she said, smiling softly.  The ‘bot wasn’t a dog, exactly, but that didn’t stop her from reaching out and rubbing her fingers at the joint where its arm connected to its body.  “You’re sweet.  Know where Jane is?”The arm carefully waved up and then down before Dum-E turned and set off across the lab, beeping all the way.

“That’s - that’s not even close to right,” Jane said, bewildered.  She dropped her marker and moved around till she could see the board from the same angle.  “Oh, OH!  Okay, fine, I guess I can see where you’d get that.  It’s not what I was going for, though.”“Is it Dracula turning into a bat?” Clint asked, head cocked to one side.“Yes!  Exactly!”Darcy immediately tackled the archer out of his seat and onto the floor, straddling his hips as her fingers dug into his sides and felt around until - “Ha!  You cheated!” she crowed, holding the card above her head.  She shook her head, scowling down at him, “Cheaters never prosper.”“Oh come on,” he complained, bracing his hands on her thighs to keep her balanced above him.  “Did you see her drawing?  We would have been stuck here forever, we never would have gotten it!”“Am I really that bad?” Jane asked, biting her lip.Bucky tugged her down so that she was sitting across her lap.  “You have other talents, doll,” he reassured her.  “Drawing’s just… not your forte.  Maybe ask Steve to give you a few pointers.”“I can tell what she’s drawing,” Darcy pointed out, still glaring down at Clint.“That’s why you guys aren’t allowed to be on the same team anymore: because you two share some sort of freaky mind-meld.”“There are some things that two people cannot go through without becoming besties with moderate psychic powers, and surviving an elf invasion is one of them,” she informed him, poking one finger into his chest with every word.

“What?” Alistair said, looking down at himself and then back up at her again.  “What’s wrong with my shirt?”“Nothing, if you like gravy stains and Darkspawn ichor,” she said matter-of-factly.  “Lucky you, Lady Cousland doesn’t mind either of those things.  However, it doesn’t exactly set the right… mood.”“Well, what do you suggest, then?”“Hold that thought,” she said, extending a finger.  “You - stay right there, I’m going to go call on an expert.”“Wait, you mean - no, not - ”It was too late, she’d already slipped out of his tent.  Darcy dusted off her knees and headed towards Leliana, seated by the fire.  She dropped down beside the redhead with a sigh, holding out a hand with three silvers in it.  “You’re right, he’s planning on tonight being the night.  Also, he’s hopeless.  Help me help him not make a muddle of things?  I know you have a shirt squirreled away for him.  I saw it.”Leliana took the money and pocketed it.  “I will help Alistair woo his lady love on one condition,” she said.  “If I give you the blue shirt for him, you must also take the green shirt meant for you… and wear it next time you speak to our dear assassin friend.”Darcy could feel herself blushing and hoped desperately that the firelight would obscure her reaction.  “I don’t - why would - ”“Trust me.  Wear the shirt.”

Bucky’s head immediately whipped up and around.  “What.”Clint shrugged, toeing off his shoes while he juggled locking the door and setting down the boxes of pizza he had balanced on his other hand.  “I mean, I lost them in the park, but yeah.  Group of alphas, weirdly interested.  Don’t know what their deal was.”Bucky immediately stood and crossed the room, crowding Clint against the wall while he tucked his face in against the other man’s neck and breathed in deeply.  He tore away a few seconds later, swearing viciously.“I swear I showered this morning.”“You’re in pre-heat.”“…oh.”“You’re in pre-heat, and you went jogging?!”“Technically speaking, I went out for pizza.  The jogging was a side benefit.”

Okay, because I dislike the sads unless in a specific mood:Instead of being in an incredibly unhappy marriage, the couple figures out that they were tricked/lied to and ends up becoming good friends.  They love each other, but they’re notin love with each other.  They compare soulmarks and find that… huh… it looks like they actually have the same handwriting?Fast forward a few years and some gauche lord from *insert appropriately disliked-by-the-English country* is new to the scene and setting the tonne afire with gossip.  Both Lord and Lady are curious, and Lord gets them an invitation to a shindig that they know Gauche Rake will attend.  Lord meets him first, and both are utterly flabbergasted when they meet, greet, and discover that they are soulmates.  Lord immediately grabs Gauche Rake by the hand and starts dragging him from the room.“Where are we going?”“You must meet my wife!”Gauche Rake: “…”  *does not foresee this going well*Lord grabs Lady and drags both of them to a semi-secluded corner.“______, meet my soulmate,” he says excitedly.Lady narrows her eyes at him.  “Charmed, I’m sure,” she says carefully.“The pleasure is mine,” he says, kissing her hand.Lady immediately strips her glove and shows him the writing that runs along her index finger.  “Is this your handwriting?”Gauche Rake: *is utterly flabbergasted*Lord: *beams like he’s just won the lottery*Lady: *nodding* “This will be much easier to arrange than I had anticipated.”

Lucian had lived for centuries after Sonja’s death, powered only by his rage and overwhelming desire for vindication.  He was the oldest of his kind and age brought both power and skill.  Pushing silver bullets from his body was barely a conscious act.  Purging the silver nitrate took a great deal of concentration, but it was by no means impossible.
He took his time, lying there and thinking as the silver coursed through his blood.  His had achieved his aim and created a hybrid, a child of his union with Sonja in spirit if not in blood.  More, he had witnessed love between a Lycan and a Vampire once again, and this romance had - he thought - a far better chance than had his own.  Lucian should be satisfied, ready to rest at last.
And yet…
He waited until the silver had at last bled from his body, until the only sounds in the sewer were the slow drip of water and his own breath, and then he rose again.  The loss of so many of his people pained him, but there was nothing he could do for them now.  Lucian made his way from the sewer slowly, taking what little he would need, and then he left it all behind.
Lucian knew the life of a nomad well enough, and took to it again with ease.  He helped his people when and where he found them, though they were few and far between.  Most he ran across were loners, those who had never taken to pack life in any form.  They kept him aware of the goings-on in the world, how the tide of the war had turned, then turned again.  Humans were the real danger now, they told him: science was their greatest threat.
He went to America to learn more, and that was where he found her.
Lucian was walking down the street and he smelled her.  He halted in his tracks, head lifting unconsciously because there was something about that scent, something he recognized.  This was an impossible thing, but there was a human who smelled like Sonja.

Darcy frowned down at her book as the hairs on the back of her neck prickled with awareness.  She was 99.99% sure that someone was staring at her.  To be fair, she was pretty stare-able on a good day, and she was wearing a fantastic boob shirt.  It was a lovely cherry red that made her skin almost glow, with a v-neck that cleaved quite nicely.  Still, this felt different than normal creepy-dude-that-can’t-keep-his-eyes-to-himself.  This felt focused.
She shut her book, gathered her purse and coffee, and headed for the door.  Fleeing?  Yes, absolutely.  The odds were good that that sort of attention was less for her as a person and more for her connections, either the godly or the scientific, and in either case would not end well for her.  She didn’t look back, she didn’t slow down, she headed straight for the Tower.  Darcy had not taken more than half a dozen steps out the door before she heard a low voice calling out to her.
“Wait, miss!”
Darcy halted in her tracks, head tilting unconsciously because there was something about that voice, something she recognized.  She turned to find a man coming toward her.  He had a narrow face and the most intense eyes she had ever seen (and she knew snipers).  Everything about him gave her an impression of sharpness.
“I believe you dropped this?” he said, extending a hand.
Darcy glanced down and saw her wallet, then looked back up at his face to find him staring at her fixedly.  “Yeah, that’s mine.  Um.  Thank you.”
“You are most welcome.”
She reached out and took the wallet from his hand.  The instant Darcy’s fingertips brushed his palm she gasped as if stung as a wave of something washed over her.  Her vision went dark and it felt as if a thousand sense-memories had been triggered all at once, a multitude of impressions without any real cohesion.  She felt so many things, so many emotions, but underpinning it all was despair: a terrible, overwhelming grief and regret and hopelessness resounding through her that culminated in a final, almost primal, scream that rang in her ears as she gasped for breath.
Darcy blinked and suddenly she found herself back in the present.  She was in someone’s arms, a low voice murmuring something in a language she could’t understand but still found oddly soothing.  She grabbed hold of him, needing to ground herself on something, and focused on breathing.  He smelled like something warm and almost floral, and Darcy was again certain that, on some level, she recognized that scent.
She pulled herself together as best she could, waiting until the trembling had mostly stopped before she tried to push away from the strange man who, she was pretty sure, wasn’t actually astranger.  He kept one arm tight around her back, holding her steady, but she pulled back enough to look at him.
He looked worried and, under her wary regard, gently reached out with his free hand to brush a few tears away from her cheeks.
“I know you,” Darcy blurted, staring at him.
“Yes,” he said, pure joy making his eyes shine, “you do.”

Clunk, clunk, thwock.
“You know as an Alpha I can smell that you’re pissed, so you might as well tell me what’s wrong with you.”Darcy bristled at being caught out, then forced herself to relax.  “If I wanted to talk about it, I’d talk about it,” she said, not looking up from her computer.
Clunk, clunk, thwock.
“And maybe,” she said, twisting to face him, “just maybe the reason I smell pissed is because you keep bouncing that stupid ball off the wall!”Johnny looked from the ball to her and back again with a raised eyebrow.  “You put up with way more annoying shit than me and my balls,” he waggled his eyebrows, “on a daily basis.  This is something else.”“How would you know,” she muttered, turning back to the computer.  Her shoulders were up around her ears and she knew that he could probably sense discomfort rapidly being added to the frustration and anger she was no doubt projecting.A hand wrapped loosely around one of her wrists, halting her typing.  “Hey,” he said, dropping down to crouch beside her chair.  “I’ve been on Reid duty for like, three months now, hanging around your labs.  I know you.”Darcy groaned and let him turn her chair so that she was facing him.  “You’re going to laugh,” she said, crossing her arms and glaring at him.”“Maybe,” he agreed, shrugging, “but then I’ll help you, promise.”

“Please, protect me while I’m in heat. I’m not ready to be claimed,” Darcy said in a flat, utterly unconvincing monotone, hands clasped before her as she gave Steve her best puppy eyes.He froze at the formal wording, then scowled at his friend as she dropped the affected pose and flopped down on the couch beside him.  “You’re not taking this seriously,” he told her, capital ‘D’ disappointment dripping from every word.Darcy groaned and refused to look at him.  “It’s just… stupid!”“If you’re not going to take this seriously - ”“I am!  I do!  It’s just embarrassing,” she muttered, staring down at her hands.  “I wouldn’t even be asking if we weren’t on lockdown from that stupid thing with those Rings guys.  I’d just go home.”“Tony would probably be willing to fly in whoever you wanted to look after you,” Steve said carefully.  “I know I’m probably not your first choice - ”Darcy threw herself over his lap dramatically, reaching up to swat at his nose. “Steve, Stevie, Steve-o, you are an awesome Beta-buddy.  You are my bestest single Beta-buddy.  There is nobody on the planet I want guarding me more than you, especially now that Jane’s gone and got herself alien-bonded.  My folks have a farm, no Alphas for miles.  That’s what I miss.”  She sighed, then grabbed one of his hands and clasped it between her own.  “Steve,” she said, utterly sincere, “please, protect me while I’m in heat. I’m not ready to be claimed.”He nodded and leaned down to brush a soft kiss over her forehead.  “It will be my honor to serve you in your time of need.”

Steve meets Thor during the events of the Avengers, but things don’t settle down long enough for them to really talk until after.  Thor and Steve realize they’re soulmates (to be fair, Thor met A LOT of different people in his short time on Midgard) at the schwarma restaurant and while Thor is overjoyed, Steve is just plain overwhelmed.“We both have responsibilities,” is his farewell to Thor before he goes riding off on his motorcycle.  Thor cannot chase after him because he does have responsibilities, and he says nothing of Darcy because he does not think it right to interfere.Steve meets Sam and, although he’s mellowed a bit, he’s still not really ready for anything more than “friends.”  Sam joins his crazy crusade and it’s only in the aftermath that they actually sit down and talk.“Is Bucky one of your - ”“No, but he’s my best friend.  He’s - ” Steve can’t even find the words.“No, I got it.”  He drops the subject because he can’t stand to see that look on Steve’s face, it’s devastating.  “Now I couldn’t help but notice you got the squiggles,” he says instead, pointing to Steve’s chest, bared for another check-up.  “You wanna explain that one to me?”Steve smirks, “You’re gonna love this one.  It’s Thor.”Sam blinks.  “The god?”“Well, technically he’s an alien.”“An alien.  An alien is one of our mutual soulmates.  Well.  Damn,” he shakes his head.  “You run into the last one yet?” he asks, tapping his own clavicle to indicate the corresponding mark on Steve.Steve can’t see it without a mirror, but he knows what the dark navy script says: Don’t you clench your heroic jaw at me!  “Not yet.  They sound interesting, though.”Sam twists and lifts his shirt to reveal blood red writing in the same hand: So chivalrous, I do declare!  My maidenly heart is all a-tizzy.  “Yeah, think we might have a firecracker on our hands.”

Clint walked in just as the Alpha on the screen leaned over the Omega and growled, “I can’t wait to see your belly swell with our perfect babies.”  He briefly considered walking right back out, but Nat was behind him and shoved him through the door before he could run.Darcy paused the video and turned to face them, face set in the neutral mask that Nat had taught her long before they all got their shit together.  She cocked her head to one side, considering them both, before patting the space on the couch beside her and jerking her head towards the overstuffed chair.  “Sit,” she said calmly.Nat gently herded Clint into the seat by the Omega before curling up on the armchair.  Her face was that special kind of blank that let Clint know she was hiding everything she was feeling, and she was definitely feeling something.“So,” Darcy said.  “I found your porn.”“…sorry?” Clint hazarded, not looking either woman in the eye.  He settled for staring at the ceiling.  It had the added benefit of baring his throat.  He flinched a little as a hand settled against along his jaw, tilting his face back towards Darcy.“I’m not mad, you idiot!  What do you take me for?  I have porn!  I’m sure Nat has porn!  The only, only reason I’m bringing it up is that I kind of noticed a certain, um, theme…?”  She took a deep breath, “Do you… want kids?”“What?  No!  I mean yes.  Maybe?”Nat was smiling just a little.  “It was not meant to be a trick question.”Clint sighed and rubbed at his eyes with the heel of his palm.  “Kids would be great, if and when we all decide that we’re ready for them.  It’s not - I just…”“Told you,” Nat said, now grinning.  “And you were worried.”“Well yeah!” Darcy said.  “I’m not ready for kids yet!  I mean, if it was something you guys really, really wanted right now, we could talk, but.  Yeah, not on my agenda for another couple of years.  A breeding kink, on the other hand…”  She crawled directly into Clint’s lap, pressing in close enough that he swallowed hard.  “That what you think about when you’re out on missions all by your lonesome?”“It’s not a - a claiming thing,” he hastened to explain.  “I just - ” he reached out and settled his hand over Darcy’s stomach, eyes staring through her off into the middle distance.  “I just like the idea of making someone who’s a little you, a little me, a little Nat.”Darcy smiled softly.  “God, you’re a sap.”Clint coughed, and he was definitely not blushing.  Definitely not.  “It’s also a knotting thing.  Totally a knotting thing, you know us Alphas, always thinking with our knots.”“Saaaaap,” Darcy sang.  “You’re an adorable sap!”Natasha slid into up against him, tangling a hand in the brunette’s hair and tugging her over for a soft kiss.  “But he’s our sap, and we like him that way.”

So...I has an idea you might enjoy? Darcy is somehow part of the Williams family. Maybe she's Toby's kiddo, maybe she's a cousin, but when she starts humming songs that the funny little squidgy things poking around the house have been (poorly, though, since apparently only the king knows how to sing) she gets sat down and the whole story explained to her so she can avoid accidentally blurting things about the Underground. Thor's less surprising than one would expect, after that story.

Darcy waits approximately twenty minutes after the last Man In Black leaves (she watches the tail lights as they disappear off into the sunset) before whipping out her iPhone and dialing her favorite cousin.  Jane and Erik are sill pacing the edges of the big ol’ sigil burned into the sand, and likely to continue for some time if she’s any judge of SCIENCE.“Not a good time, Dee,” he says in lieu of an actual greeting.  She can hear shrieking in the background.“I met a god,” she says.“…What.”“And then there were, like, secret government agents.  And then more gods, and then a giant robot with lazer eyes and a wormhole.  Okay, technically this story begins and ends with wormholes but.  Yeah.  I met a god.”“Are you describing the plot of your new favorite anime or - ”“Toby.”“Okay.  Huh.”  She hears a click-click, then gunshots, and the shrieking cuts off with a high, thin wail.  “All right.  I can be there in six hours.  Less if I take the shortcut.”Darcy wrinkles her nose.  Toby is cool, but his sister… well, Sarah is cool too, but also ridiculously overprotective of anyone she has ever babysat. Even after Darcy had learned the reasoning behind it, she still chafed at the borderline-smothering.  She’d gotten more calls from Sarah during her first month at Culver than she had from both her parents during her first year.  “Skip the shortcut, please,” she says.  “We can always tell her later?”“If she finds out you’ve kept something like this from her she’ll keep you crystalled for a year,” Toby reminds her with the weary resignation of a man possessed of his own personal fleet of protection goblins.“It’ll be fine!  The gods are totally gone.  For now.  I just… I want a hug.  I survived a giant alien robot attack today.  And I didn’t even get a t-shirt.”“Six hours, cuz.  Then it’ll be you, me, Frick, Frack, Scrap and the gang, and all the ice cream we can handle.”

Natasha took her to find her costume for Tony’s Halloween party, and actually laughed out loud when Darcy explained who she wanted to go as.  The redhead was smiling widely, genuinely, and with a near-terrifying amount of glee as she led Darcy into the dress shop.
“You’re… way more into this than I thought you would be,” she said cautiously.  The shop they had entered was the kind that didn’t actually have prices posted.  Darcy was really hoping that this was just a pit stop on their way to some awesome bargain bin.  Really,really hoping.
“You are going to earn me a great deal of money,” Natasha said solemnly.  “I will spot you the money for your costume and split the pot with you.”
“Me going to the party as Miss Scarlet is going to win you money?”
“A great deal of money.  And bragging rights for years.”
“How - you’re not going to tell me, are you,” she sighed.
“No, but I promise that you will enjoy it when I win.  You’ll win too.”

Charles sighed, exchanging yet another one of those stupid speaking looks with Erik.  “My dear,” he said gently, “we know you’re capable, but it’s not necessary.  Even in this time, there are alternatives.”Darcy rubbed her temple with one hand, trying to stave off the headache that always presaged one of her heats.  “Okay, lets talk alternatives.  Aside from ‘go to Omega house and enjoy old-timey medicine’ and ‘barricade myself in one of the labs’ what have you got?”They were doing the looking thing again.“Oh my god, Charles, use words!  Out loud!”“Be calm, Darcy,” Erik said, the twist of his lips making it clear he was aware of the irony ofthat statement from his mouth.“We were merely discussing the best way to, ah, put forth our alternative,” Charles explained.  “We would not wish to offend.”Darcy rolled her eyes.  “Guys, I’m pretty hard to offend.”“Very well.  Erik suggested that, in lieu of drugs or cloistering, you might… make use of one of us.”She had to work hard to keep her mouth from dropping open.  “One of - ” she cut herself off and actually considered it.  The mansion was pretty Alpha-heavy.  Darwin, Raven, Erik, and Charles were all Alphas, while Hank, Sean and Angel were Betas - Alex was the only other Omega.  Still, that left plenty of options… assuming they’d all discussed it.  Holy crap, had they all gotten together to discuss her heat?!“No, no, nothing so gauche as all that,” Charles said hurriedly.  He winced at the dark look she shot him.  “Apologies, but you are rather loud, my dear.”“Well then plug your mental ears or something!  It’s not a bad suggestion,” she grudgingly agreed.  “If he agreed, Darwin wouldn’t be a bad choice - ”Erik growled.“Ah,” Charles said delicately.  “I think you misunderstand.  When I said ‘us’ I was referring to Erik and myself, not the entirety of the mansion.”“I doubt Darwin would have the experience, the control necessary to keep from marking you,” Erik said, voice still rough.“So your alternative plans were you - or you,” Darcy summed up.Another speaking look.“Or both of us,” Erik said bluntly.  “We could easily break your heat early if we worked together.”Darcy’s mouth gaped open.  “I, um, I will think about it.  Thank you for the offer, I’m going to go now.  And think.  Um.  Yeah.”  With that, she fled, heading for her own room because two of the most attractive Alphas she’d ever encountered had just offered to tag-team her through her heat and she needed some time to piece herself back together before her hormones staged a hostile takeover of her higher reasoning.Let us know if you have any questions for us, Charles murmured.  We would be more than happy to assuage any of your concerns.“I’ll write out a list of questions, thank you and GET OUT OF MY HEAD.”

“You would kill her?  For what reason?  She has caused no harm, and clearly it was our mistake that brought her here,” Drax said.“No, guys - it’s a reference,” Peter said exasperatedly.“A good one, so you get some points,” Darcy said.  “Nowhere near enough to make up for kidnapping me out of my room via wormhole, but keep trying.”“Reference?  To what?  Is this another of your legends?” Gamora asked.“Yeah, kind of - ”“Like Kevin Bacon?” she continued, sounding intrigued.Darcy slowly turned to Peter, an unholy smile lighting up her face.  Peter thought that it probably said a lot (and nothing good) that he thought she looked at least 1,000x sexier when she was clearly plotting.  “Don’t,” he said half-heartedly, knowing it was futile.“Kevin Bacon?” she said.  “The legend of Kevin Bacon?”“Yes, Peter has told us of his great deeds.”“Oh.  Right.”Peter gave her props for keeping a straight face.“You know… if you really want an insight into Terran cultural artifacts and, specifically, Peter - there are some stories I could tell you about one of the greatest rogues and smugglers of our history: Han Solo.”Yeah, he was probably doomed.

Darcy woke primarily because she was cold, but also because there was an argument being conducted in harsh whispers not five feet from where she lay.  She blinked up at the ceiling, waiting patiently for awareness to penetrate her sleep haze and the fever she’d been battling for the past two days.  Eventually things clicked and she realized that 1) she was in Steve’s bed, in Steve’s room, and 2) Steve was arguing with Bucky and they were arguing about her.“ - should let me take her,” Bucky was insisting.  “I got more experience takin’ care of sick folk than you, I looked after your dumb ass for years, didn’t I?”“Then stay here,” Steve responded.Bucky shook his head immediately.  “No, my room’s comfier, you’re still livin’ like you don’t know where your next meal’s comin’ from.  ‘Sides, I’ve got more pillows and you know Darcy loves pillows.”“I can grab some from her place when I get her a change of clothes,” Steve countered stubbornly.“…fine, I’ll just wait till you’re called up and get her then.”“You’re trying to kidnap what I’ve rightfully stolen,” Darcy muttered, watching them with great amusement.  They immediately turned to her as the first syllable passed her lips, both of them wearing the slightly-guilty but mostly-mulish expressions of people who’d been caught out doing something they probably shouldn’t have.  “This is not where I fell asleep,” she said calmly.  “I distinctly recall falling asleep on Jane’s couch.”“Yes,” Steve nodded, “and then Jane asked me to carry you to bed.”“She probably meant to my bed, not yours.”“Then she should’ve been clearer,” he said unrepentantly.  “I wasn’t gonna leave you alone!  You’re sick.”“Steve’s right, you shouldn’t be alone when you’re sick,” Bucky agreed.“JARVIS?” Darcy called.“Yes, Darcy?”She raised her brows at the soldiers.  “I wasn’t alone.”“It’s not the same,” Steve grumbled.“But if you wanna go back to your rooms, we’ll take you,” Bucky said.Steve looked outraged, “What?!  Bu - ”“And one of us can stay with you there,” he continued, staring her down.Darcy frowned at them.  “Why the sudden nursemaid act?  Guys, seriously, I’m fine - or I will be.  You don’t need to put yourselves out.”They exchanged a look before both of them moved, in sync, to bracket her on the bed.  Bucky tugged her over to lean against his side while Steve tucked the blankets around her.“We know we don’t have to,” Steve said.“But we want to,” Bucky finished.“But… why does it matter so much to you?”Steve sighed.  “We’ll talk about it when you’re better.”“So get better quicklike,” Bucky instructed, tugging on her a little to get her to lie down again.Darcy grumbled a little, but curled into Bucky’s warmth, sighing happily when she felt Steve settle behind her.  Between the two super-soldier metabolisms, she was finally warm again, and soon drifted off into a restful, healing sleep.

About three things Jane was absolutely positive:First, there was a monster living under her bed.Second, it wanted to eat her (hypothesis, unproven) it was hungry.And third, there was no way her parents would believe her.…Jane waited until the house had gone quiet, then waited a little longer until the rustling started.  It had happened like this every night for the last week: the rustling would begin in her closet, then move to beneath her bed, then something would slip out of her room and go downstairs to pillage their poptart collection.  Jane was more than a little upset that she had been the one accused of demolishing the poptarts (the incriminating boxes beneath her bed hadn’t helped) but she decided to take comfort from the fact that the monster liked breakfast pastries more than it liked human flesh.After all, if it liked poptarts, just how monstrous could it be?“I know you’re there,” Jane said, keeping her voice firm.  She had a flashlight clenched in her hands and a small assortment of snacks in her lap.  There was a notebook and a pen next to her because she was experimenting, this was science.  She was as prepared as she could be.The rustling stopped.She took a deep breath, then: “I know you’re there,” she said again.  “You’ve been eating our poptarts.  I got blamed!” she couldn’t entirely keep the outrage out of her voice.There was a faint sound, almost like - a giggle?“It’s not funny!” Jane said indignantly.  “I got in trouble!”“M’sowwy,” said a small voice.“…I forgive you.  Will you… could you come out?  I’ve got snacks…”“You won’t scweam?”“No.”“Pwomise?”“I promise,” she said, and braced herself.Soft scrabbling and scratching made its way out from under Jane’s bed and then, in the faint light through her window, she saw it - no, her - her own personal monster.  She looked like a little girl, definitely younger than Jane’s own very mature (according to her parents) eight.  The kid-monster had dark skin that looked odd and very long hair tangled around her slim shoulders.  She was studying Jane every bit as intently as Jane was studying her, pale gold eyes almost glowing.“I’m Jane.”The little kid-monster bobbed her head, making her hair shift and revealing two stubby horns at her hairline.  “I’m Dar-cy,” she said carefully, revealing very faintly pointed canines when she smiled.  “Sowwy ‘bout the tweats.  I was weally hungwy.”“It’s okay,” Jane said magnanimously, then gestured to the snacks.  “We can share these and that way I won’t get in trouble.  Why are you under my bed?”“Didn’t know it was youws,” Darcy said, scrambling up onto the bed to sit cross-legged opposite Jane.  “Jus’ went into the fiwst house I found.  ‘m lost,” she explained.  “Bad man opened a doow’n he got mad when I wouldn’t listen to’m, so I wan ‘way.”“What about your parents?”“Dey pwob’ly lookin’,” Darcy said, mumbling around a mouthful of peanut butter crackers.  “Dunno if they’ll find me though, th’door was shiny, ‘n it made these noises,” she made whistling and chirping noises, gesturing wildly with her hands till she nearly toppled off the bed.  “Made my tummy ache,” she finished with a grimace once she’d righted herself.“Well, you can stay here until your parents come back for you.  Just stop stealing food, I can bring you stuff.  I’ll share my meals with you!”“Thank you,” Darcy said and promptly tackled Jane with a hug.Jane ‘eeped’ then hugged her back, having no way of knowing the multiple ways that she’d just changed both their lives.

It had been a long series of days and she wasn’t at her best.  On top of that, she hadn’t really expected any interruptions, so Darcy paused, mid-stretch, as her brain parsed out that proposition.  She snorted, then dissolved into helpless giggles.  Pure sleep-deprivation had her drifting forward in her mirth till her forehead rested on her desk.  After a moment, once her laughter had trailed off, she rolled her head to one side so she could look at Johnny.He had a faux-pout on his face, exaggerated enough that it nearly hid his very real concern.  “I’m not hearing a ‘no,’” he pointed out, sliding his hands into the hair at the nape of her neck and starting a slow massage.  His fingers warmed gradually as they moved carefully down her spine to curl over her shoulders and start to knead.She cleared her throat to cover a moan.  “We’re almost done, I swear.”“Who’s this ‘we’ you’re talking about?  I bumped into Goldilocks in the hallway, he had the good doctor slung over his shoulder.  No more excuses, Dee, it’s time for all good assistants to go to bed.”“I could - ” a yawn escaped, “ - hmmm…yeah, prob’ly a good idea.”“Are you going to get all weird about me carrying you?” Johnny asked.“M’legs work,” she muttered.“Yes, and they’re fine legs.  Some of my favorite,” he agreed readily, pulling her chair out and turning it so he could help her to her feet.“Some?” Darcy echoed, glaring at him playfully.“They’re great legs, don’t get me wrong.  I just think they’d look better in our bed and, once they’re rested up again, wrapped around me.”

“What?” Sam said, blinking slowly.  “I’m awake.”Natasha and Darcy exchanged amused looks, then the former reached out and gave the man a gentle shove.  Sam immediately tipped sideways into Darcy’s lap, looking slightly startled at finding himself there.  He adjusted quickly, though - wriggling around until his head was in the brunette’s lap and his legs were draped over Natasha’s.Darcy grinned down at him and scritched her nails through his hair, a little longer than usual since he’d been out in the field with the Captain on a long-term Hydra run.  Sam smiled up at her sweetly and she barely resisted the urge to coo at him.  She watched his eyes drift shut under her ministrations, heard his breathing even out as he finally succumbed to sleep.  When she looked up again, Natasha was watching them both, looking as soft as Darcy had ever seen her.The redhead waited till Darcy looked up, then carefully leaned across Sam to press a kiss to her lips.“What was that for?” Darcy asked.Nat shrugged.  “I need a reason?”“Nope, but if I don’t know why, how do I get you to do it again?”“All you have to do is ask, cолнышко.”

Sam/Darcy, "things you said when we were on top of the world"
Chapter Notes

        See the end of the chapter for  notes




Darcy thought that she would probably have a good minute, maybe even three, to spend regretting her life choices before she hit the ground and went splat.  She didn’t really regret shoving Jane out of the way of the spinny blue portal they’d accidentally created, because Jane was her bestie.  She did regret allowing Jane to have “five more minutes” to spend on her project before calling it a night.  Clearly those five minutes were the difference between life and death.
At least she was falling over water, though she was near enough that she could make out the New York coastline in the distance.  She definitely preferred to fall into the ocean, mostly because she was less likely to injure or traumatize and innocent passerby.  Darcy was practical like that.
There was a loud thunderous crack, and Darcy looked around to find three small figures speeding her way through the air.  It took seconds for them to resolve into the figures of Iron Man, Thor, and Falcon.  A moment later and Falcon was dropping into a spinning dive, pulling up underneath her and catching her in his arms.  She ‘oofed’ as the wind was knocked out of her, but wasted not a moment to wrap her arms tightly around his neck, burying her face in his throat and absolutely shaking in relief.
Seconda after that and he was hovering, both Iron Man and Thor coming in close to form a triangle as they waited for a helicopter that had been following them.
“That was anticlimactic,” Tony complained.
Thor sighed, “Now is not the time for your jests.”
“…I can’t tell if you’re serious or punning.”
“Not that I’m objecting,” Darcy said once she got her breath back.  “But what the hell?  How?!”
Sam clutched her close.  “Stop questioning and just let me enjoy this.  Jane’s calculations had enough margin for error that we weren’t sure we’d get to you in time.”
Tony’s mechanized groan was ignored by all, as was his, “Again, I can’t tell if that’s a pun or purely an accident.  Either way, please stop.  Clint’s bad enough without you two joining him.”
“In time?  No seriously, what?!”
“Darce, that portal didn’t just go through space, it went through time.  Mighta been a second for you, but for us it’s been almost a week.”
She shook her head, not ready to think about that.  “You mean you’ve been planning my rescue for a solid week and you still couldn’t figure out how to work in a Big Damn Kiss?  I’m disappointed!”
It was difficult to tell with his flight goggles on, but she was pretty sure he was scowling at her.  “You almost died not even a minute ago and you’re already joking about it?”
“It’s either joke or cry hysterically,” Darcy told him seriously.  “Now, which would you like to deal with until I’m back on the ground?”
Sam sighed and pulled her somehow closer.  “I’ll take you any way I can get you, just know you won’t be leaving my sight for the foreseeable future.  You got no idea how much I missed you.”
“…and you just tipped the scales towards ‘cry,’ hope that suit’s waterproof.”

Chapter Notes
A/N: this does not technically fulfill my requirements but I got ten of these in as many minutes so warming up with an ol’ reliable seems like a good plan.

        See the end of the chapter for more notes




The single worst thing about working with Jane was the schedule.  Darcy did not actually like being up at all hours of the night.  She’d done it when necessary in undergrad but it wasn’t her preferred modus operandi.  This was what had led her to take the long walk to the communal kitchen for a midnight snack.  Technically speaking it was more like 2:00AM and the “long walk” was more of a “brief elevator ride” but she needed to move around a little or she was going to fall asleep on Jane’s notes again.
She stuck some popcorn in the microwave and set the sensor, then drifted through the open area to the nearest couch to wait.  Darcy let her eyes slide shut, certain that the microwave would wake her with its beeping when the popcorn was ready.  It would just be a minute.  Maybe two…
“…should wake her up.”
What?  That was definitely Steve.  Why was Steve in her bedroom?
“You seen the bags she’s been sportin’?  Have a heart.”
Aaaaaand that was Bucky.  She remembered now, she was on the common floor, not in her suite.  Also, who was he to talk about bags!  Not even his super soldiery self could completely disguise the rough nights, which Darcy knew were their frequent late night run-ins in the kitchens.
She could hear cloth rustling, then: “One of us could carry her to her room?” Steve suggested.
At this point she thought ‘waking up’ would just be awkward and considering she doubted she could convincingly fake sleep in either of their arms, she really hoped they would just leave her there.
“No, we might wake her up,” Bucky replied.

Oh thank god.

“Feel bad about leavin’ her here,” Steve sighed.  “…she looks so peaceful.”
“Beautiful,” Bucky corrected wistfully.
What?
“Yeah…”
She felt fingers run over her hair gently, and shivered, but turned it into a slight shift in her position, turning to face the back of the couch because goddamnit, she knew she was blushing.  She knew.
“Way to go, punk.”
“Jerk.”
“C’mon, lets go, we can check on her when we get back.”
“You mean actually talk to her, you sure you’re ready for that step?”
“If you are, I am.”
There was another shift, this time a blanket being draped over her before they left.  Darcy waited till she thought she’d heard them leave, then another five minutes on top of that, before she sat up.  “What the hell was that?”
“If I may, Ms. Lewis, I believe that was Captain Rogers and Sergeant Barnes finally agreeing to set a date to, ah, ask you on a date,” JARVIS informed her, making her and shriek.
“Don’t you have a personal protocol against answering rhetorical questions?” Darcy asked suspiciously.
JARVIS went quiet.
“…there’s a bet, isn’t there.”
“There may be a bet.”
“Involving…?”
“The majority of the permanent residents.”
“The majority of the permanent residents of the Tower think it’s just a matter of time before Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes ask me out?”  Darcy flopped over sideways, head reeling from unresolved sleep debt and shock.
A prolonged silence was her only answer.
“That one wasn’t rhetorical!”
“In that case, yes, miss.”

“Is it going to hurt?” Bucky asked quietly.  He was watching the door to Stark’s lab like he expected the ghost of Zola to appear and spirit him off.  Steve and Sam eyed each other but it was Natasha who stepped forward, cupping his face in her hands and tilting his head down so his eyes would meet hers.“I do not know,” she told him frankly.  “It might.  We do not know what went into creating that arm, we do not know all that they have done to you.”“But we’ll be here for you,” Sam promised.  “We won’t leave you alone for a minute.  You’re stuck with us.”“Tony’s a good man,” Steve said sincerely.  “Abrasive… but a good man.  He’s going to help, and we’re going to be with you the whole time.  ‘m not leaving you, Buck, never again.”Bucky nodded slowly, watching as Natasha’s solemn expression was replaced by a small, hopeful smile.  “Okay, lets do this.”

“Stark residence, how may I help you?”“…this was a mistake.”“I’m sorry?”“Hah, I think that’s my line - ”“Miss, I believe you may have the wrong number, now - ”“Sorry, let me start again: Hi!  I’m Darcy Lewis.  H-howard gave me this number?  Told me to call?  If it’s a ba - ”“No, no, miss, he’s been expecting your call, one moment, please!”Darcy stared at the phone while she waited.  What the hell was she doing?  Changing history is what, and why?  Because of some funky tattoo that had appeared the instant she landed in this bizarro-version of her own world?  This was stupid.  This was so stupid, she was no Maria Carbonell!“Darcy?”“…hi.”“I wasn’t expecting you to call me tonight,” he said, sounding cautious.“Believe me, I wasn’t expecting to be calling you,” she sighed.  “But I… I think I owe you an explanation.”“It’s not every day a woman faints in my lap, I’ll admit, but they were our first words,” he said lightly.  “I felt a little light-headed myself.”“Not that, just… was there ever anything… weird with your words?”  He was silent long enough that she prompted him: “Howard, please be honest.”“Why are you asking?  Was there something off with your words?”Darcy snorted, “You could say that, considering I didn’t have any until about two months ago.”  When I fell through a portal and into 1930′s New York, she mentally added.“When you what?”“Oh, I said that out loud, didn’t I?”“Yes, yes you did.”  Howard’s voice was a mixture of suspicion and concern and it made her heart hurt a little.  “Darcy, if that’s your real name, what’s - why are you telling me this?”“Because I’m not going to see you again, I’m leaving New York tonight.  I can’t stay here, there’s too much - I can’t.  I just thought I owed you the explanation: I’m from the future, or a future.  I fell through a portal into the past in… an alternate universe, I guess.  In my universe there are no such thing as soulmarks.  I shouldn’t even be telling you this much, I just.  What kind of messed up system is this?  I can’t be meant for you, I’m not even supposed to be here!”  She took a deep breath, “I know this all sounds crazy.  You probably think I’m nuts, and hopefully… hopefully, that’ll make it easier for you to not see me again.  Goodbye, Howard.”Darcy hung up before he could say anything, staring at the old-fashioned phone.  It took her just a moment to grab her things and leave.  She had no way of knowing if call-tracing technology existed in this time, she hadn’t exactly made a study of early 20th century technology, so she’d made her call from a payphone.  Now she needed to get the hell out of dodge, though not too fast.  If Howard was looking for her in the nearest cities, he wouldn’t be looking for her in New York, it was the perfect bluff!After all, even nowadays, New York was pretty big.  She’d be able to hide from him until Jane and the others found her, she was sure.(She was wrong.)

“Would you stop wriggling around?”“I’m trying to get comfortable, but it’s hard!”Sam rolled until he was hovering over her.  “I’m not going to make the obvious joke,” he said, but he was watching her very carefully.  “I am just going to point out that you wanted to watch the meteor thing that’s supposed to be goin’ on tonight, but if you keep wigglingagainst me then that’s not gonna happen.”“Oh?” she asked, arching a brow.“You’re doing it on purpose, aren’t you?” he realized.  “Woman, did you bring me out here to seduce me?!”“What was your first clue?  The soft blanket, the wine, maybe the romantic setting?  Do you have a problem with me seducing you, Sam Wilson?”Sam opened his mouth.Darcy gave him a look.Sam shut his mouth.“That’s what I thought,” she said brightly.  “Now quit your bitching and kiss me, fussybritches.”

“I think I’m in love with you.”
“What?” Darcy asked, looking up.  She frowned at Johnny, who was standing just inside the doorway to Jane’s lab, watching her.  “Hey,” she said, smiling, “When did you get here?  And why the long face?  Ben scratch your bike again?”
“Ha, nothing so serious.  Just… checking up on Reed, making sure nobody’s strangled him yet.  Thought I’d swing by and see if you were busy, maybe wanted to grab some food?”
She bit her lip, thinking, and completely missing the way Johnny’s eyes zeroed in on the action.  “I’d love to, really, but - ”
“But you’re busy, it’s short notice, I get it,” he said, smiling, though it didn’t quite reach his eyes.
“Sorry, next time?” Darcy asked, flashing him an apologetic smile.
“It’s a date,” he confirmed as she turned back to her work.
“What?”
“Sounds great!”

Deadpool keeps poking you.“Would you stop that?” you snap, slapping his hand away.  It’s difficult to tell through the mask, but you’re pretty sure he’s frowning at you.“Is this some choose-your-own-adventure bullshit?” he asks.“…what?”“You, here,” he says, speaking very slowly, as if to a small child (or Wolverine).  “Did you choose to fall into this fanfic?  Because, I gotta say, this one’s pretty boring.  Amuse is usually WAAAAAY more fun.  With the soulmates and the knotting and the AUs and whatnot.  She’s slacking.  Or possibly just hangry, the little boxes haven’t told me yet.”“I just asked her a question,” you say grumpily.  “And then I wound up here.”“Huh.  Should have asked @ozhawkauthor, she’s much cooler.”There was a blinding flash of light, then a deafening boom.  When you came back to yourself, you were lying on the ground, Deadpool hovering over you.  You blink slowly, but his outline remains hazy, alarming you until you realize that the haze is caused by the smoke rising from his suit.  You can smell singed rubber and ozone.“See what I mean?” Deadpool grouses.  “She hit me with lightning!  Must be hangry.  Lets wait till she gets distracted by food, then make a break for it.  If we’re lucky, we can cross over into another fic until she gets over her munchies.  Or we could get pancakes, that’s a good time-waster.”“You sure you’re not the hangry one?”“I don’t get hangry, I get murdergry, it’s completely different.”

You’re halfway through your order of French Toast when Deadpool jerks abruptly, head tilting to the side like a curious dog.“What?” you ask warily.“The author’s back,” he says slowly.  “And she ate something, I can tell.”There’s a part of you that wants to say fuck it, nod, and just go with it, but the rest of you is curious enough to ask: “How can you tell the author’s not, uh, hangry anymore?”“Because she’s mocking me,” he says sourly, gesturing at your plate.“French Toast constitutes mockery?”“It’s French,” he says shortly.  “The French are always mocking me.”“…is the author French?” you ask.“What, no!  Where would you get that idea?”“I have no idea,” you tell him, then fork up more food, hoping he’ll let you finish.  You’ve barely got the bite halfway to your mouth when a firm grip wraps around your wrist and gently shakes it.“Nope, no mas, we gotta go find the plot.”“What?”“Well, we haven’t had sex yet, and the anon asked for soulmates, but I’m not your soulmate, so clearly the point of this story is to find your soulmate.  Hope you’re ready for a roadtrip!”“Wait, but - I thought we were going to try and escape amuse’s story?  Wasn’t that the plan before?”Deadpool eyes you seriously.  “Sweetie, if you’re looking for narrative conformity in a tumblr fic, you’re gonna be disappointed.  This isn’t AO3, this is the wild fic west.  Plots are murdered left, right, and center!  Cliffhangers dangle like Sam Eliot’s droopy mustache!  Structure is as clear as a muddy watering hole!  It could be worse, though, it could be,” he shudders dramatically, “fanfiction dot net.  In the bad ol’ days, I mean.  When there were more internal asides and author’s notes than I have floating boxes… and they weren’t even trying to be crazy!”“I get the picture,” you say gloomily.  “Expect the unexpected, nothing is as it seems, blah blah blah.”“Right, and since we haven’t boinked yet, this obviously isn’t THAT sort of fic, so we gotta either go look for the plot (your soulmate), or wait for wacky shenanigans.  Since I am a walking, talking wacky shenanigan, I vote we go looking for the plot before I get upstaged.”“Can’t I finish my French Toast?”He gives you a flat look.“Right, me finishing my food is about as likely as Miranda Flairgold finishing her Harry Potter magnum opus.”“Whoa, whoa, whoa - rule number one - ”“Wait, now there are rules, how does that make sense?!”“No obscure reference jokes, we don’t wanna be that kind of fic.  Well, we do, because I’m here, but lets keep it to the multitudes of comic canon and refrain from referencing fanfictions directly, that’s a level of meta I don’t think you’re prepared for…”As he continues his list of ‘rules’ you vaguely wish that you’d been dropped into this universe with a pen, a smartphone, something to write with.  Maybe you could keep track of the rules, or - with REAL luck - write yourself into a plot with more cohesion.  For the first (but surely not the last!) time, you think to yourself, Why on Earth did I ask to fall into an Amuse fanfic?

Darcy was looking for her favorite pen, bending to check under her desk when she heard it: “You’re old enough to be her father, man… keep it together,” muttered very quietly.She stood up immediately, glancing around and finding Rhodey standing a few feet away, eyes shut tight and a pinched expression on his face.  She leaned against her desk, folded her arms, and waited for him to open his eyes.He winced when he saw her watching him.  “You heard me.”“Yup.”He ducked his head, blushing.  It was kind of adorable.“As I see it, we’ve got two options here, Colonel.  Option one is I chock this up to too much time spent around Stark when you were young and impressionable, or…” she trailed off suggestively, raising her brows and waiting for him to react.“Or?” he asked, eyes narrowing.“Or option two, you take me out for pizza and we find out if this,” she gestured between them, “is just a surface attraction or something more interesting.”“Your statement implies the… surface attraction is mutual,” he said.“Fishing for compliments?”Rhodey shook his head, a small smile starting to grow on his face.  “Nah, not that kind of fool.  Sounds like you’re just about done for the day, and I know Tony’s only got a few minutes before Pep drags him off.  Option two?”“It’s a date,” Darcy said, feeling that tell-tale belly flop of the good nerves.  If she’d thought it would net her results like this, she’d have tried the bend and snap weeks ago…

“All right, Smokey, you are now definitely drunk.  You ready to spill the beans ‘bout why you haven’t sealed this deal?”  Darcy was genuinely curious.  She knew he was into her, the staring made it kind of obvious, but though she’d given him every indication that the interest was reciprocated, he had yet to actually make a real move.He had become her favorite drinking buddy, though.“Your boobs are kind of intimidating,” Johnny told her.Darcy immediately choked, grabbing for the nearest napkin and pressing it to her mouth to keep from spraying her drink all over the hero’s face.  “Run that one by me again?”“Your boobs,” he said seriously, gesturing at her décolletage.  “It’s like.  I have climbed some mountains in my day.  I know the slopes.  But I dunno if I’m ready for Everest, if you know what I mean.”She leaned over, ignoring his soft gasp, and grabbed his drink.  It was an actual mixed drink and not a shot, it took her a few seconds to chug.“I would have bought you one if you wanted…” Johnny said, looking confused.“I’m definitely not drunk enough for this conversation yet, boyo.  Gimme a minute and a daiquiri and then we can talk about your boob complex.”

DARCY'S FANTASTIC BREASTS


Oops, sorry, I'll format it correctly: Rarepair meme: Sam/Sif #21 "things you said when we were on top of the world"



“Quite the view,” Sam said, looking out at the galaxy.  He knew there wasn’t actually any chance of him falling off the Bifrost and into the stars, but that didn’t stop his skin from prickling at the seeming proximity to the blackness of space.  “If I had a thousand years, or,” he shot a smile at his designated tour guide, “even six thousand, I don’t think I’d ever get used to it.”Sif grinned, “I think you underestimate your adaptability.”“Oh really?” he asked, turning to face her.  The view was, if anything, even more spectacular.  Sif’s hair was down and she was in her version of casual wear, in this case loose-fitting trousers and a tunic highlighted both her strength and her femininity.“You do yourself too little credit, Sam.”“I had no idea your opinion of me was so high.”She took a step towards him, eyes glinting, and it occurred to Sam that - even if he’d wanted to - he couldn’t exactly move away, she had cornered him pretty effectively.  “Then I fear you have not been paying attention.”

Darcy had spent the last two days on a decorating bender.  She’d been living in the Tower for almost three months, but it’d taken her near that entire time to acclimate enough to the space (and stop thinking that living in Stark Tower was an elaborate fantasy drawn up by her subconscious) that the white walls began to annoy her.  The walls were no longer white, her knick knacks were no longer in boxes, and she had about fifteen framed pictures waiting to be hung.  Before she tackled that next step though, she needed a coffee fix.The Tower didn’t lack for coffee options, truth be told, but Darcy had a weakness for Starbucks’ more sugary confections.  And their secret menu.  And their surly-but-hiding-it-behind-coporate-mandated-cheer baristas.The elevator was empty when she got in, so she leaned against the back wall and let her eyes slip shut, yawning hugely.  93 stories, three blocks, and then sweet, sweet, sugary goodness would be all hers.Darcy’s eyes opened as she felt the elevator slow, then stop on the 42nd floor.  She blinked rapidly as the doors opened to reveal a man wearing a red and black suit with two swords strapped to his back and numerous guns strapped to the rest of him.  He nodded to her, then leaned casually against the adjacent wall and pulled a small knife and a block of wood out of seemingly nowhere before beginning to whittle.It was obvious that he was nowhere near done, but even so, Darcy could easily make out the half-formed visages of Yakko, Wakko, and Dot taking shape under his nimble fingers.She snorted, then grinned at him when he looked up.  “Wheel of Morality, turn turn turn, tell us the lesson that we should learn,” she half-said, half-sang.Even with the mask, she could see his jaw drop.  He was frozen for roughly 8 floors, then he dropped both wood and knife and lunged for the elevator buttons, hitting every single floor between them and the ground.Darcy stared at him, completely nonplussed.After a moment (the elevator slowed, stopped, the doors opened smoothly) he turned to face her.  “So,” he said, sounding completely nonchalant, “tell me about yourself.”She clapped a hand to her side, where those exact words were printed in all-caps with little flourishes and unnecessary umlauts, and then swayed.  The man in red - her soulmate - was quick to grab her and ease her to the elevator floor.  He helpfully shoved her head between her knees, babbling a litany of questions about her medical history.“I’m not anemic, malnourished, or shocky, just… tired.”Since he was there and she had few inhibitions on a normal day, let alone when sleep-deprived, Darcy sat up and poked and prodded till he’d settled down next to her.  Then she promptly climbed into his lap and arranged his arms around her.  He was practically vibrating, he was so tense, and though she couldn’t see his expression she could almost feel his shock.“You wake me up again when we hit the lobby, then you’re taking me for coffee.  Okay?  Okay, good.”  She leaned her head against his shoulder and promptly drifted off, the sound of her snoring (a sound that was more snuffle than proper ‘snore’) soon filled the elevator.“What the fucking fuck,” Deadpool said, staring down at his lapful of buxom brunette.  “Did my karma just get run over by my dogma?  How the fuck - ”
Quit bitching and just enjoy the cuddles, Wade.
“Hey, hey, when are you going to write me a sex scene?!  You keep giving me this - ” he gently wiggled Darcy, “but you never let me actually touch her.  In a fondly fondling fashion, I mean.”
I like writing fluff!  Smut is intimidating!
“You can’t keep making ‘Ribbed for Her Pleasure’ jokes about my horrific scarring and horribly disfigured body unless you write me actually fucking somebody.  It’s just not fair.”
Just because I can’t help but think of the Power Perversion Potential, that doesn’t make me obligated to write about it.
“It’s a fucking tease, is what it is!”
Keep whining and I’ll write a smutty story about Ajax.
“Fucking Francis?  You’ll write fucking Francis Freeman fucking before you write me fucking?  What kind of sick, twisted bitch are you?!”
The kind that gets in arguments with fictional characters, apparently.
“Yeah, well, I got 99 problems and one of them is your prudish - ”
The End.
“What?  Rude!”
…or is it?
“See!  Fucking tease!”

Chapter Notes
This makes more sense if you check out this post first, but can be read without:http://amusewithaview.tumblr.com/post/143532163545/taleasedubh-libertinem



On the flipside, imagine if Hydra, knowing just how much a serumed up person can survive, actively was looking for Steve… and they found him first. Imagine Steve barely-conscious and still trembling with bone-deep cold as he’s stuffed into The Chair for the first time.It doesn’t work as expected the first time (Steve thought the grave was supposed to be cold and final but instead he’s dying by inches with electricity burning through his veins, twisting whips of fire tearing through his brain) so the Hydra scientists note down their results and hunker down for a fullscale Science Experiment!They recalibrate and try again.And again.And again.Meanwhile Steve tries to hold it all together. He knows that he’s surprised to be alive (in the worst moments he wishes he wasn’t). He knows he was fighting a war (he’s pretty sure they must have lost). He knows that nobody is coming for him (not the kid from Brooklyn, the only one who really cared about HIM is, well…)(And nobody’s coming after the soldier, the war hero, the propaganda machine, that came after. Who would believe he could survive that crash? The ice?)(Even if he lives through this, the man that used to be Captain America isn’t sure how much of Steve Rogers will be left.)After a few months, one scientist gets the bright idea to bring in the Original for comparative testing. The new Subject goes absolutely ballistic the first time he sees the Winter Soldier.Focused on restraining their new Subject, none of the scientists catch the flicker of expression (emotion) that dances over the Original’s face.It’s three weeks before they leave the two alone together without muzzles to prevent biting (from the Winter Soldier) or speech (from the Subject). The higher-ups are annoyed by the number of otherwise promising recruits who have requested transfers after five minutes of talking to (or being talked at by) the Subject.“I know you,” the Winter Soldier says firmly. After three weeks of observation he’s sure in this if not much else. They’ve wiped him a few times for fresh data, but he’s been clinging tenaciously to what little he can conjure up of that face, that voice, that attitude.(‘Mouthy’ is the word that keeps springing up.)(And punk. Or jerk? He’s not sure why those words make his lips twitch up at the corners.)“You do,” the other man, the one who once was Steve Rogers and might be again. “You know me, and we…we’re gonna get out of here. Together.”Eight days later, they do.

Okay so Bucky and Nat are the couple and they’re either grabbing coffee after their early-morning run (they are That Couple, the one that is super fit and stupidhawt and exercises together and gives everyone around them complexes) or, if this is still in the MCU, then it’s some AU where everything isn’t terrible and BuckyNat escaped from the Red Room/Hydra together and are, like, this ridiculously badass spysassin duo.  MARRIED ASSASSINS, OKAY?!  OKAY.  Anyways even if they’re married assassins they’re still That Couple, just with a higher body count and 10x the murderstalk.(Clint is their bestie who crashes on the couch [or in their bed] all the time because he keeps misplacing the keys to his apartment [”You OWN THE BUILDING,” Bucky exclaims for the eightybajillionth time, “JUST MAKE ONE OF YOUR TENANTS LET YOU IN.”  “I wasn’t going to WAKE Mrs. Elliot,” Cline it utterly indignant and missing the point, damnit, “She has an early shift!”  “Let it go,” Nat sighs, because it’s not like Bucky actually MINDS Clint crashing, he’s just incapable of understanding his absentmindedness.])So they’re in line (stupidly long line), and Bucky is all post-jog, post-cooldown, good-exercise mellow and not-quite-tired, but relaxed, and he gets that vague body-awareness of ‘there is a smol person beside me’ and ‘smells good’ and out of the corner of his eye he sees shiny, soft-looking hair and just grabs her hand because it’s gotta be Nat, right?WRONG.It is too early for this, Darcy thinks, then looks up at the Strange Man holding her hand.  Strange Man is unfairly hot, and just a lil sweaty, and he has really nice blue eyes and stubble and IT IS DEFINITELY TOO EARLY.He blinks at her for a second.  “You’re not my wife.”“Nope.”  More’s the pity.“You’re holding the wrong hand,” says a warm, throaty voice, and Darcy’s already got pleasant little shivers running down her spine just hearing it.She turns around and of course.  Of fucking course the hot guy is married to that woman.  That woman is a goddess.  She’s all silky-looking red hair and bright green eyes and more curves than a mountain road.  Darcy is no longer sure whether she wants to be Strange Man’s wife or just wants her.Maybe both.  (At the same time?)Strange Man is looking between the two of them with a silly grin.  “You sure?”“Pretty sure,” Darcy squeaks.  Damnit, be cool!  Now both of them are smiling at her and it’s just too much pretty, too early.  Her brain is flashing 404.“I feel committed to finishing this Starbucks experience with you, now,” Strange Man tells her sincerely, his smile now crinkling the corners those devastating baby blues and giving Darcy palpitations.“I’m not paying,” she blurts.He mimes shock and pain, gently dropping her hand.  “Nevermind,” he says regretfully, “guess it’s back to my wife.”“I’m not paying either,” the Goddess says, giving him an arch look.There’s an amused chuckle coming from Darcy’s other side, distracting her from the Ridiculously Hot Couple’s flirty byplay.  She turns to see that what was formerly a wall made of brown leather jacket and broad shoulders has turned, revealing an extremely attractive black man with.“Come hold my hand, sir,” he says, holding out his hand and wiggling his fingers teasingly.  “I’ll buy you any frappuccino you want.”Strange Man beams, practically bouncing up (ahead of Darcy) and taking the other man’s hand, entwining their fingers.  “See?” he says, giving a mock-scowl to the two women over his shoulder, “At least someone cares about me.”Darcy snorts, she can’t help it.  When she glances back to the Goddess, she nearly jumps when she finds the redhead staring at her with a curious look on her face.  Darcy coughs, then tilts her head towards the two men, now discussing baseball, of all things.  “He always like this?”“Sometimes he’s worse.”“And you put up with him?”The Goddess grins lazily, “There are significant benefits.”“Lucky,” Darcy, on a six plus month dry spell, says under her breath.“Let me buy your coffee,” the Goddess offers.  “It’s only fair since my husband has cut ahead of you in line.”“That’s really nice, but you don’t - ”“I insist.”Darcy opens her mouth, then shuts it.  Why is she arguing against the pretty lady buying her her coffee?  By the time the two make it through the line, both Strange Man and his new friend have already received their beverages and are waiting.  The new friend is quickly introduced as ‘Sam,’ which prompts Darcy to introduce herself, which leads to poorly-rendered Austen jokes, which somehow leads to breakfast, which somehow leads to dinner and a movie, and before Darcy knows it she’s dating a married couple and another man and all because of a cup (or four) of coffee.

The first time Darcy notices the hottie grad student staring at her from across the room, she shoots him her best ‘don’t even think about it, punk’ look and goes back to mixing drinks for the privileged Oxford set.
The second time, he’s much closer, ordering a pitcher of beer, but still with that strange, almost searching, look on his face.  She’s not a puzzle, she doesn’t want anyone from this place (this time) trying to figure her out.  She serves him his beer, takes his money, and goes back to ignoring him.
The third time is closing time, and she’s ushering the most die-hard of the drinking set away from the bar and out to the waiting taxis.  He’s standing towards the back of the bar, holding his jacket and being quiet.  It’s probably why Pete and Geoffrey have left him for last.
“Closing time, dude,” she calls back to him.  Then, smiling wryly in a fit of nostalgia: “You don’t have to go home but you can’t stay here.”  And that song won’t even come out for another few decades, if it comes out at all.  Stupid alternate universes.
“It’s Charles,” he says.  “Not ‘dude’ or ‘hottie grad student.’  Technically, in a few more days, I will more rightfully be called a ‘hottie doctor,’ though not that sort of doctor.”  He’s giving her an adorable semi-inebriated grin and his relaxed attitude and big blue eyes cause her to overlook the actual words he’s saying until he’s just in front of her.
But I didn’t actually say any of that -
“Out loud?  No.  You didn’t.”
Darcy starts to edge backwards, but is halted by the hand that wraps around her wrist.  She looks from his hand up to his face, eyebrow raised.
“Apologies,” he says, snatching his hand back and blushing (why is he so cute, but in, like, a fuckable way).  The blush spreads up to his ears.
“You’re reading my mind,” she says.
“Ah, yes.  Your thoughts are very -”
“Private, you asswipe,” she snarls, quietly though, mindful of the fact that Pete and Geoffrey most definitely have their eye on the little exchange going on over by the door.  “So you’re a telepath, whoopdy-doo and good for you, what do you want?”
He is taken aback by her sudden hostility, she can tell.  “Only to speak with you, Ms. Lewis.  Your situation is rather unusual and, as you may have guessed, I’m a bit of a connoisseur of the unusual and odd.”
She squints at him.  “Are you MI6,” she asks abruptly.
“What?!  No!”
“Affiliated with any weird government or pseudo-government or anti-government organizations, coalitions, or groups?”
“Not that I’m aware of.”  He shrugs in a self-deprecating manner, sticking his hands in his pockets.  “I’m just a telepath, trying to talk to a pretty girl from an alternate timeline.”
Why is he so charming?  Is it part of the telepathy?  “Don’t answer that,” she says, because his eyes have lit up and he’s obviously gearing up to respond to her thoughts.  “Fine,” she decides.  “I will walk you home if you stay out of my head.”
Charles nods agreeably and holds out his elbow.
Darcy rolls her eyes at him and shoves him towards the nearest chair.  “I still have to close up, idiot.  I do work here, remember?”
“Ah, right.  I will just wait, then.”  ~I’m not an idiot you know,~ he continues in her brain, sounding almost petulant.  ~I just…forgot.~
“Rich kids,” she scoffs under her breath.  “Also: out of my head!”

They were jogging along the path when Bucky first noticed the swearing.  Between the two of them Steve had the better hearing, but even now, almost a year after he’d been declared “no longer a(n accidental) threat,” Bucky still couldn’t turn off the hyperawareness that had kept him alive for nigh on seventy years.  He slowed, knowing Steve would follow, turning towards the beach to find the source of the -“Motherfucking shit!  Damnit all to the deep!  Why does this crap always happen to me?!”Steve frowned, tilting his head to one side.Bucky raised his eyebrows.Steve shrugged, then nodded, and the two left the path and started picking their way over the rocks and down to the sand.  Bucky didn’t know what he expected to find: that damsel sounded distressed, but he wasn’t sure it was the kind of upset the two of them could assist with.  She sounded more angry than anything else, with a little bit of the whine that characterized Tony’s rants when he was feeling particularly put-upon (or Pepperless).What they found was a small rocky inlet with a shallow pool.And in that pool was a mermaid.She looked every bit as surprised to see them as they were to see her.  “Um.  Hey,” she said, giving a small wave.“Ma’am,” Steve said, tipping his head in automatic courtesy.  The utter stiffness in his shoulders and the way he brushed his arm against Bucky’s told the brunet that the other man was just as flabbergasted as he was.  “Are you all right?”She snorted.  “Do I look all right to you?”“Is there anything we can -” Bucky gestured towards her tail, freezing mid-motion because Jesus, Mary and Joseph, her tail.  It was a good fifteen feet long, translucent fins running down the sides, and split into four larger fins at the bottom that almost looked like wings.  It was a dark blue with a faint silver sheen.  The blue ended at what would be the lower end of a human woman’s pelvic region, but the silvery sheen seemed to cover all of her skin.“Please don’t take a picture.  It’ll definitely last longer,” she said dryly.“Sorry,” he said, pretty sure he was blushing.  “I’ve never seen -”“Right, you’re not supposed to see.  Except I’m a colossal fuck-up who slept through the tide shift and got beached on the fucking sand like a damned whale!”  Her tail rippled, the lowermost third curling and twisting across the damp sand almost eel-like.  “Augh,” she grunted disgustedly, slapping an open palm across the tide pool’s surface and flinging water against the nearest rock.“Is there anything we can do to assist you, ma’am?” Steve asked.She blinked up at them, eyes big and blue and all-too human.  “You really, genuinely mean that,” she said slowly, looking from one man to the other.  “You actually want to help me, not… dissect me or something.”They exchanged glances.  “Neither of us are big fans of dissection, or involuntary medical experiments,” Bucky said flatly.“I feel like there’s a story behind that,” the mermaid said, then shook her head, sending several long black curls sliding behind her shoulders and -Steve turned around while Bucky looked up at the sky.“Whoops!  Sorry about that,” she said cheerfully.  Then, after a moment, “All covered again.”Bucky glanced down to find that she’d parted her hair at the back of her neck and brought it all forward to drape over her chest.  It pooled in her lap and spilled out into the water in thick, ropey-looking locks of intermittent length.“So, about that help you were offering…”And that was how Bucky and Steve ended up hanging out on the beach with a mermaid until the tide shifted enough that she could swim away.“I owe Fury another ten bucks,” Steve said as the mermaid disappeared from view.  A final flick of her tail sent water arching up into the air and she was gone.“Hallucination isn’t a delayed cryo symptom, is it?” Bucky asked idly.“Not that I know of.”“Can we check?”“Soon as we get back to base.”

They had been sitting around the table staring at the thing for the last forty-five minutes.  The first fifteen had been spent visually inspecting the thing (Eliot), sniffing the thing (Parker), and attempting to research the thing (Hardison).The next fifteen minutes had mostly been Eliot and Hardison arguing over who should take it out of the box.“I’m not touching it,” Hardison said firmly.“Why not?”  Eliot cracked his knuckles, still scowling at the thing.  “It’s got buttons, one of them even glows.  It’s probably tech, which means they left it for you.”“Okay, first, it was addressed to all of us, so don’t even start with that.  Second, why is it the tech becomes mine as soon as it looks dangerous?  Not cool, man.  Third, hell no, I have seen this movie too many times and I am not gonna be the cool black dude that dies first!”“Nobody’s dying,” Parker cut in sharply, halting her sniff test to favor each of them with a glare before she moved on to an auditory exploration, tilting her head and listening intently.“It’s from Sophie and Nate,” Eliot said after another minute of contemplation.  “They wouldn’t send us something really dangerous… would they?”They all stared dubiously at the box.“I’m getting the hazard suit,” Hardison declared.“Nobody is touching it until we have more information,” Parker decided.Then, suddenly, the thing began to emit a soft buzzing sound.“Oh no,” Eliot said, eyes going wide.“Wait, you know what it is now?  By the sound?!”“It’s a very distinctive sound!”

“Are you - are you all right?” Jane asked carefully.  They’d barely gotten five minutes into the movie and Clint had already hauled her up into his lap and was cuddling her like she was a beloved teddy bear.“Yes,” he said flatly, staring straight ahead at the television.“Are you sure?”“Yes,” he said vehemently.  “I’m fine,” he insisted, then sniffled.“You’re crying,” she told him, reaching out and brushing away a few tears with her fingertip.“I’m not crying, you’re crying,” Clint insisted nonsensically.Jane sighed and leaned her head against his shoulder.  “If it makes you feel better, only the first ten minutes of Up are traumatizing.”

Sometimes Darcy felt that somehow, somewhere, the universe had gotten dreadfully mixed up - how else could you explain the three of them?  Princess, dragon, knight, they made up the one of the oldest archetypical storylines in the cosmos and yet they none of them quite fit the roles they were supposed to portray: the princess was scarier than any dragon and mostly wished to be left alone, the dragon preferred courtly song to shining gold and wanted to right the wrongs of the realm, and the knight had the softest heart of them all and wanted only to look after those he loved.She huffed out a breath that was more smoke than anything else and curled around the Princess Natasha and Sir James, they would meet their strange fates together and that was all she cared about.

Excerpt from "Hollywood’s Greatest Love Stories: Truth is Stranger Than Fiction,” Milton Publishing, 2063 -
“The film had just barely managed to fall into both their wheelhouses: a traditional period piece based off true events that included a touching love story (one that miraculously did not have a tragic ending).  In the end, while The Conservationist’s Equation was successful and even award winning, the real story was the beginning of the tumultuous love affair between two of Hollywood’s most vivacious stars: Thranduil Woodhouse and Darcy Lewis.Of course, many friends of both stars publicly remarked that the start of their relationship was nowhere near amicable…”

“Hey, Steve-o, could you get my back?” Darcy asked.  Confident in his ‘yes,’ she immediately turned her back on him and tilted her head down, lifting her hair away from the back of her neck to give him better access.Steve, meanwhile, stared at the picture she presented: the smooth line of her neck, the intriguing dip of her waist that her suit showed off so spectacularly, the way her skin seemed almost to glow against the dark navy material.  She wanted him to put his hands on her, and he was morethan willing, but -Darcy shivered as he slicked the sunscreen over her shoulder.“You okay?” Steve asked, watching his breath lightly stir the fine hairs at the base of her skull.“Yeah, it’s just kind cold.”“Sorry.”  He concentrated on trying to get her efficiently covered and reined in the impulse to press and rub, to rest his palm over the knobs at the top of her spine or spread his fingers solely to enjoy the softness of her skin against his calloused hands.“Could you get just under the line of the suit in the back?  It tends to shift.”Steve swallowed so hard he was surprised she didn’t hear it, but set to his assigned task as swiftly as possible.  This was (wondrous) torture and he couldn’t handle much more (never wanted it to end).  “Done,” he said after a few more (endless) moments.Darcy turned and flashed him a bright smile.  “Thanks!  I’ll probably come find you in a couple hours to reapply, if you don’t mind?  The water always washes some off and I gotta combat sunburn any way I can.”Do this?  Again?  After she’d gone and gotten herself good and wet?“Sure,” Steve said faintly.  “Sounds like a plan.”

The second time Darcy moved the hammer was much like the first: it was in the way, she wasn’t really thinking about it, and it happened almost reflexively.  The big different between the second time and the first time was that Darcy wasn’t alone this time, and therefore couldn’t shrug off the weirdness.One second the hammer was sitting on a stack of print-outs and reports, the next it was on the table.  She released her hold on the handle carefully, the tips of her fingers lingering on the smooth leather grip almost as if magnetized.  If she looked closely, she could almost see flickers of blue dancing up the grip towards her hand…“Darcy?”She jumped like a startled cat, turning to face Ian with a slightly guilty look on her face.  “Um, yes?”“I thought Thor didn’t like people playing with his ham - ” he stuttered to a halt, face suffusing with color.  “I mean, I thought you all avoided… it?”“Yeah, basically.”  Give or take a weirdly Arthurian legend or two.  “But it was in the way and I’m sure he won’t mind.”  No, I’m not.  “Just in case, though… could you maybe not say anything?  I don’t want to make it a Thing.”  Don’t think about it, Darcy.  Don’t think about it.  It’s a fluke.  It doesn’t mean anything.  Even if this is the second time.  Maybe it’s just being… friendly?“Yes, of course.”  There was an awkward pause as he stared at her and Darcy tried to look at anything that wasn’t Ian or Mjolnir.  “Ah… could I have that second paper,” he pointed at the newly-liberated stack.“Sure,” Darcy chirped.  “I’m just going to - ” she gestured blindly, then flinched when her hand brushed Mjolnir again and this time she was sure that it was almost… sticking to herfingers.  What the hell?!  “Bye,” she said, taking the unclaimed papers and fleeing.  This was too wiggy and she was sure she had things to do that were mundane and as unmythic as possible, please and thank you.
But just in case, no more touching Mjolnir, not even if Thor sets it on the toilet seat again.

72 James Kirk(Star Trek)/ Darcy Lewis
Chapter Notes

        See the end of the chapter for  notes




The first time Darcy Lewis spoke to James Kirk, it was to hand him a PADD containing a list of esoteric research materials that Spock needed him to sign off on.  The captain had smiled blandly at her and blindly signed it before returning to his argument with Lieutenant UhuraThe second time Darcy Lewis spoke to James Kirk, it went something like this:Darcy waited until she was about three feet from the table before she cleared her throat and settled into parade rest.  The Captain’s eyes were, somehow, even bluer in person than they’d been in the holos.  The CMO spared her a single glance before turning a sardonic look on his friend.  She wasn’t sure what the look was for, but she was pretty sure there was an unflattering assumption or two involved.“May I help you, yeoman?” the Captain asked politely.  The language was formal but there was still something loose and relaxed in his posture.  He wasn’t fully “on,” as it were.  To be fair, he was in the middle of his meal.“There’s something wrong with Commander Spock,” Darcy said.Dr. McCoy scoffed.  “There’s a lot wrong - ”“Could you elaborate?” Kirk asked her.“When I brought him his meal, he thanked me - ”“Manners a crime now?” McCoy muttered.“ - and then he hugged me,” Darcy finished, ruthlessly repressing her desire to glare at the ‘good’ doctor.Both men blinked at that.  “Hugged you?” Kirk said.“The hobgoblin… hugs?”“Not as a rule, no,” she said dryly.  “On top of that, Corporal Foster voluntarily left her station at 1500 hours to consume her second meal of the day and Colonel Rhodes asked Commander Scott for advice on a structural issue.”“That… doesn’t sound so bad?” Kirk offered.“Sir,” Darcy drew herself up, staring the captain down in spite of her diminutive stature.  “I know my scientists like Commander Scott knows the Enterprises engines.  They may not be exploding, but trust me when I say that something hinky is going on and I’m pretty sure it has something to do with that weird singing plant Lieutenant Sulu brought back from Apra Zeta.”The third time Darcy Lewis spoke to James Kirk, after what came to be known as the “Karaoke Plant” incident, was in passing as they walked in opposite directions down one of the ship’s corridors.  All she said was, “Told you so,” and all he said was, “Sorry about your hair.”All told, it was perhaps a little impressive that it only took until the eighth time they spoke for one to ask the other to grab a drink.  Or, as Darcy would put it when children (hers, usually) asked: “It took two invasions, three away missions, four apologies, and a houseplant named Steve before your dad got up the guts to ask me out.”(And two wormhole incidents later, she said ‘yes.’)

Darcy stopped dead in her tracks as she heard a strange whistling noise accompanied by a pleasant tenor voice:“…9% pleasure and 20% pain and 67% reason to remember the name!~”She snorted, turning to find the singer and - whoa.  The source of the whistling sound was a katana cutting through the air gracefully while its wielder did an odd sort of shimmy and sway around a parking meter.  He was wearing a red and black suit of the super persuasion and had a second katana strapped to his back, along with a few guns.“What are you doing?” she asked, because she really couldn’t help herself.“Ooh!  An audience!”  He spun to face her and in spite of the mask she got the impression that he was grinning.  “I’m doing my meter maid dance.”“Your… meter maid dance?”“It’s kind of like a rain dance, but for quarters.  Or stripping!  It’s also kind of like stripping.  But my clothes stay on (you should thank me) and the pole is smaller and, again, quarters not dollar dollar bills, y’all!~”Darcy looked from him, to the vehicle parked in the spot that corresponded to his “pole.”  It was a van.  It looked like it had, at one time, been a dark red, but it had faded to a dull orangey color.  Someone had spray painted a decent rendition of a narwhale on the side.  The narwhale was using one of its flukes to flip off the sky.  “Um. How many quarters do you need?”“How many have you got?”“I asked you first.”“I asked you second.”Darcy sighed.  “It seems, sir, that we are at an impasse.”“If you’re gonna make like Gandalf, I’m gonna make like Leeloo, and then maybe we can make something of this muddle.”“It frightens me that I was able to follow that.”“If you can follow me, I’ll happily follow you (to the ends of the Earth, but not beyond because the parking there sucks).”“I - ” She decided it wasn’t worth it to continue the charade.  Darcy dug through her purse and pulled out a handful of change.  She considered the strange man for a second before tossing the money in his general direction.  “There, I have now made it rain.  Hope the rest of your day goes well.”“Thank you, pretty lady!”If this was the weirdest thing that happened to her this week, she would count herself lucky.  (It wasn’t.  It also wasn’t the last time that she saw the strange man with the dual katanas.  These two facts were not unrelated.)

Darcy looked from Bucky to the downpour she could see beyond their little nook.  “So,” she said, stifling the urge to fidget since there just wasn’t enough room, “how come that thing doesn’t have an umbrella setting?”
He raised an eyebrow at her.  “It’s an arm, Darcy.”
“A mechanical arm!  It should have settings!  Like… um…”  Vibrate, her brain helpfully supplied.
“Vibrate?” Bucky asked, second eyebrow rising to join the first.
“Oh look!  The rain is stopping!  We can go back to the Tower!  So I’m going to do that.  Right now.”

Darcy sees him between the shoulders of a few of the less-injured office workers she’s currently organizing.  He’s covered in rubble dust, one sleeve torn almost completely off and blood dried to a brick red on that arm.  There’s blood smeared across his forehead as well, but he’s too far away for her to be certain whether it’s his.  He’s scanning the collected survivors and Darcy barely has time to direct the few she’s speaking to to one of the teams setting up search parties and information collection before he spots her.“I’m fine, barely scra - ”  Her words are muffled by his shirt when he yanks her into his arms.  He’s got one hand wrapped tight around her waist and the other cradling the back of her skull, pressing her so close she can hardly breathe.  It’s the safest she’s felt since this all started, five - maybe six - hours ago.He releases one deep, shuddering breath into her hair, then loosens his hold just enough to peer down at her face.  He doesn’t say a word, just pushes a few locks of her hair behind her ear, tracing his fingers along a shallow cut that runs from her cheekbone to her chin.  His hands are steady, but his lips are pressed to a thin line, the fine wrinkles at the corners of his mouth and eyes carved deep with strain, and his eyes - “Hey,” she says softly.  “I’m okay.”  She braces one hand on his shoulder and goes up on her toes, using the other hand to draw him down so she can press a kiss to his cheek.  “Bruce, I’m okay,” she whispers.He kisses her then, and it says everything he can’t put into words.  It says I almost lost youand never again and a hundred other things that make Darcy grip him back and return his kiss with equal fervor.He breaks away with a soft exhale and they each lean into the other, pressing their foreheads together and sharing air for a moment.“You know,” Darcy murmurs wryly into the scant space between them, “this almost makes me miss Gotham.”Bruce doesn’t laugh, but he does smile.  She counts it as a win.Some photographer snaps a photo of their embrace: the couple holding onto each other in the midst of tragedy and horror, rubble dust clouding the air, organization efforts all around.  Only intervention by Wayne PR prevents it from being used in a Times article.Alfred frames a copy and hangs it in a lesser-used hall in the manor.

Owens women never forget their roots, and they can spot each other on sight.Darcy has run into distant cousins and clan in three different cities during her travels with Jane.  Each has welcomed her, invited her for tea or lunch - that is, if she didn’t get the chance to extend the invitation first.  What was once necessary networking, a just-in-case exchange of contact information and current family trees that must be completed has become a far less fraught enterprise since Sally and Gillian Owens broke the family curse when Darcy was twelve.They were too late to save her parents, father lost to the cure and mother lost to the heartbreak that came after.  Owens women love deeply and many (too many) followed their men, one way or another.  Darcy was lucky enough to be taken in by her mother’s younger sister.  Brigit was young enough that they were near to sisters in attitude themselves.  They made it work, and when the curse broke seven years after the death of Darcy’s parents, they laughed and cried together in equal measure.Still, of all the places to find family, Darcy hadn’t expected to find it here.She stared at the redhead who had just entered the room in five inch heels.  Pepper Goddamn Potts carried an air of competence and ruthless efficiency as easily as she carried her tablet.  She also carried that indefinable sense that Darcy associated with magic and family.“Dr. Foster, Ms. Lewis, your accommodations are ready and - oh.”“Wow,” Darcy said after a brief pause.  “Ok, I really wasn’t expecting - ”“Neither was I,” Pepper said, surprise melting into a smile.  “But it’s a pleasure.”  She moved forward at the same time that Darcy did, but it was the younger woman that bypassed the outstretched hand and went for the hug.“You two know each other?” Jane asked incredulously.“Not exactly,” Darcy hedged.“We’re cousins,” Pepper said.  “Distant ones, but - ”“Close enough to recognize each other.  Which is really all that matters.  It’s nice to see you, cousin.”“We’ll have to catch up soon,” Pepper decreed.They exchanged knowing grins.“Midnight margaritas?”“Midnight margaritas.”

(Mid-Thor)The debrief had been swift and simple, more information would be delivered en route and once they had arrived.  Clint was one of the first out the door, heading for his current berth to grab his gear.  He stilled for a moment when a hand tapped his shoulder, turning his head to see the Strike leader scowling at him.  Rumlow jerked his head to one side, indicating an offshoot corridor.“Can I help you?” Clint asked, half curious and half belligerent.  Specialists and team leaders didn’t traditionally get along, and the lone wolf attitude characteristic of the latter was only half the problem.  Most of the teams, and Strike especially, were Dom-heavy, whereas specialists were more of a mixed bag.“Coulson vouches for you,” Rumlow said.“Yeah, and?” he asked, taken aback by the non-sequiter but trying not to show it.  On study, Rumlow looked oddly tense: jaw clenched and posture more aggressive than the conversation seemed to warrant.  Granted, Clint had only worked with the other man a few times, but he thought he had a general idea of him from scuttlebutt and such.  Rumlow wasn’t actually trying to assert himself over Clint, not that it would have done him any favors if he’d tried, but something had apparently gotten his back up if he was unconsciously slipping into obviously dynamic body language.“The scientist you’re evaluating, she’s got an intern.  You should receive her dossier on the way.  I need you to look out for her.”Clint raised an eyebrow.  “Civilian safety is always a SHIELD priority.”Rumlow grimaced, “I know the party line, but I need you to look out for her.”Again, there was something extra in the other man’s voice, echoing his posture.  It was verging on the command voice a Dominant would employ, but not directed at Clint.  Abruptly, he was reminded of a rumor that had made the rounds a few years prior, something about a Strike member and a high schooler Matching.  He’d never paid it much mind but - “I’ll keep an extra eye out,” he said seriously.  He couldn’t imagine being Matched to a civilian, and if the rumors were even a little true…  Clint watched the line of Rumlow’s shoulders soften as he relaxed.“Thank you,” he said.  “I owe you one.”What kind of submissive would Match with Rumlow? he couldn’t help but wonder.  Well, apparently he’d be finding out shortly.(Mid-CA:tWS)Sam stared at the Strike leader warily.  Both of them were bruised and beaten, but Rumlow looked like he had a bit more energy to spare than Sam thought he could muster.  He opened his mouth, probably about to deliver some sort of pre-fight one-liner (Sam was starting to recognize the type), but Sam beat him to the punchline.Even if he felt absolutely ridiculous using the code-phrase Fury had given them.“Princess says the fat lady is singing…?”Instantly Rumlow stood down, aggressiveness melting away like a popsicle in a furnace.  “Finally,” he sighed.  “Shit musta really hit the fan if Fury’s finally calling me back in.”Sam nodded, “You could say that.”Further conversation was halted by the imminent crashing of a helicarrier into their floor, prompting both men to sprint for the window.“When we get out of here, you gotta explain that code,” Sam panted.Rumlow shot out the glass ahead of them to make it easier to jump.  “It’d be my pleasure.”

The gifts had been showing up like clockwork all day.First it was breakfast, delivered to the lab by a deeply grumpy Clint.  “I lost a bet,” he said shortly as he set down the mugs of frothy caffeinated goodness and a passel of pastries from the local deli.  “Don’t ask,” he added, when it was clear Darcy was about to.One hour later, it was Tony swinging by with a new taser.  “He’s got good taste, plus I’m a genius, so you kind of have to love it.  You love it, right?”Darcy rolled her eyes, but she also nodded.  It was an electric (pun intended) blue and barely wider than a pen.  She had already named it Jenny and she was sure that they would be very happy together.Lunchtime saw a second meal delivery, dropped off by Thor and Jane.  Thor was also dropping off Jane along with lunch.  “I still have reservations,” the scientist informed her, “but I guess he’s pretty okay.  He has decent taste in take-out.”Natasha came next, roughly two hours later, bearing a shiny box full of chocolate truffles and bonbons with a varied assortment of fillings.  All three women crowded around the box (Darcy was generous enough to share).“What do you think?” Jane asked.“I would like to point out that my opinion is the one that matters most.”“He knows I will hurt him if he hurts her,” Natasha said.“Sitting right here, guys.”“I told him they’d never find his body,” Jane confided.“Seriously?”“Death comes after pain,” Natasha explained.  “I can make it last far longer.”“Ah,” Jane nodded, appeased.  “Makes sense.”Darcy groaned, grabbing another truffle.Both women (Nat left after assisting the other two with decimating the chocolate) waited with bated breath for the next present.  At 3:30PM on the dot, Steve and Bucky appeared with several thin bags full of -“Records!” Darcy shouted in glee and immediately started tearing through them.  There was a wide variety from big band music to eighties glam rock to nineties grunge - there didn’t seem to be a clear theme, except that all of them made her smile for one reason or another.“We’re happy that you’re happy,” Bucky told her, grinning at her enthusiasm.Steve opened his mouth to say something, but was cut off by a metal elbow planting itself in his ribs.  He coughed, rubbing his chest, then agreed.  “He’s a lucky guy,” he said sincerely.Darcy was too distracted by her presents to notice the byplay, but muttered a quick, “Thanks!” to them before they left.She could barely concentrate for the next few hours, trying to organize some of the collaborative projects in between watching the clock and the door.  Jane left her alone for the most part.  One hour passed, then two, then three, and just as Darcy hit quitting time, her phone let out a distinctive chirp.The message was from Brock, and all it contained was a single photo.

She gulped hard.Moments later, the phone chirped again.  This time there was a message: Roses are red, Violets are blue, You can do whatever you want to me. (please do.)It was a good thing that the lab doors were automated for those on the access list, otherwise their structural integrity would have been sorely tested by the admirable speed one Darcy Lee Lewis achieved as she fairly flew to the elevator.

Fun fact: being around Asgardians could be positively exhausting.Darcy had spent the last three days showing the warriors three plus Sif around New York.  It had been, by turns, educational (she hadn’t thought it was actually possible to be kicked out of a buffet for eating too much), amusing (their collective reactions to the Statue of Liberty), terrifying (Hogun on a Segway was goddamn menace), embarrassing (Fandral.  Just… Fandral.), and borderline deadly (Sif did not respond well to catcalling).“Darcy!”Speak of the devil.Darcy let out a near-inaudible whine from her prone position on the couch.  She refused to open her eyes and acknowledge the other brunette.  “Yes?” she asked after another moment or two of silence.“What new Yorkian experience do you have planned for us today?” Sif asked, sounding genuinely anticipatory.“It’s called ‘vegging out.’  I really feel like Volstagg will enjoy it.”“Clint has told us that you have bards and skalds, performing on something called the broad way?”“Yup, that’s a thing.  You should have Tony score you guys some tickets to Hamilton.  You’ll love it,” Darcy told her, flapping a hand in the general direction of the lab (down and probably left somewhere) and still refraining from opening her eyes.“… do you not wish to join us?”“I wish to join with this couch.  I wish to stay put for the next decade or so.  Maybe, if I’m particularly motivated, I will get ice cream at some point.  Actually, yes, that sounds good.  I’ll put that in the plan.  My five year plan is to maybe go out for ice cream this afternoon?  Otherwise, nothing.  Not moving.  Too tired.”“Have you grown weary of us, then?” Sif asked, more subdued than Darcy had thought Asgardians were even capable of sounding.At that, she cracked open an eye.  Sif was sitting opposite her, perched on the edge of the coffee table.  “I’m not weary of your company,” Darcy said slowly.  “I am just genuinely tired.  You guys are… kind of a lot, all at once.”“Perhaps if you were to spend time with only one of us at a time?”“I mean, theoretically - ”“Just me?”“I - ” Darcy paused, mid-thought because that… that sounded kind of pointed.“Perhaps I could join you on your outing this afternoon, I like ice cream,” Sif told her.  “I also take pleasure in your company.  It would please me to enjoy both at once.”That sounded almost like a come-on?  The implications were very date-like.  But she had to be reading this wrong.  Sif was just friendly.  Like all Asgardians (in Darcy’s experience) were friendly.  Right?“I could definitely see you fitting into the plan,” Darcy said after a moment.“Good!” Sif said brightly.  “It’s a date!”Ok, maybe her social reading skills weren’t as rusty as all that.“Yeah,” she said, grinning.  “It’s a date.”
