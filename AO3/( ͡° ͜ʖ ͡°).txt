Summary
You'd been friends with Jung Hoseok for a while... but what happens when friendship goes further?
Notes
So, this happened

          See the end of the work for more notes




( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

You’d been friends with Jung Hoseok for a little over a year now… You’d only met him in person once, briefly and quite by accident, but somehow the two of you had just clicked. He was such a sunshine whirlwind of a human being that he couldn’t help but make you happy. You’d hit it off right away, and he’d grabbed your phone and put his number in, “Let’s be friends! You seem fun!.”You became fast friends, but he was also busy as hell, and most often in time zones worlds away, but he never failed to make you smile. Sometimes you’d wake up to cute text messages (HobiHobi: [Good morning beautiful]), you’d get cute pictures during your work shift (HobiHobi: [to make your day go by faster]), and sometimes he’d send ridiculous memes that he knew you’d groan at (HobiHobi: [It’s fucking hilarious, don’t lie]). You considered him one of your closest friends.You loved BTS, too, and of course you followed their progress and texted him back constantly, often sending commentary when you saw fan videos of their performances, or weird memes, or hilarious photoshopped shit. You: [What’s with those circle glasses for Cypher 4, man… that look is over… and is that a bathrobe? What are you doing? (≧∇≦*) ]He, of course, did not simply take it lying down. HobiHobi: [Please, we both know I look good no matter what I’m in ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]You sigh and toss your phone onto your bed, wishing you could agree less than wholeheartedly, because he did look good… Too fucking good. It had been entirely too long, and even a blind person would be able to see that Jung Hoseok was a goddamn fine specimen. You flopped face first onto your bed and sighed. You weren’t supposed to want your friend like that… but watching the choreography and the fucking sinful way he could move did all kinds of things to you that you tried not to think about too hard.HobiHobi: [Anyway, what you up to? (＾ω＾)] You: [I’m in bed… it’s late here. You’re half a world away. (　＾ڡ＾)] HobiHobi: [In bed eh??? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)] You: [Jung Hoseok, don’t be a creeper (ꐦಠ皿ಠ )] HobiHobi: [You love me. （；￣︶￣）]You sigh again… ‘love’ was a strong word. You cared about him to be sure, and loved him as a friend, yes… but you also wanted him… desperately.
You: [Keep dreaming Hobi (人 •͈ᴗ•͈)] HobiHobi: [You wanna know what I dream about you? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]
You swallow… hard… surely he’s not implying what it seems like he is? You opt for the safe route, trying not to think about it.You: [You’re banned from that emoji… you use it too much] HobiHobi: [ ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)] HobiHobi: [ You don’t wanna know? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]You gulp and send the safe message instead of the one you want to.
You: [Goodnight, Hoseok (ᴗ˳ᴗ)]
Your phone lights up one last time with a message back. You bite your lip as you read it.
HobiHobi: [Hope you dream of me, beautiful ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)]
*****HobiHobi: [Are you awake?!] HobiHobi: [Hey! Hey! Wake Up!] HobiHobi: [( ≧Д≦) Stop sleeping! I have news!] HobiHobi: [*whines* ] HobiHobi: [⁀⊙﹏⊙⁀] HobiHobi: [Maaannnn text me the minute you get up. g2g (一。一;;）]You wake up to the backup of messages that Hoseok left on your phone while you were sleeping. ‘What the hell was so important that he couldn’t wait?’
You: [Alright crazy, calm down. Wtf? (ᗒᗜᗕ)]
You go through a large portion of your day as per usual before you get the response.HobiHobi: [Omg yasss finally done. News! I have news! (*ﾟﾉOﾟ)] You: [Sooooooooo?] HobiHobi: [Beg me for it ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]You almost choke on your drink. ‘What the fuck?’You: [ಠ_ಠ Fite me Jung Hoseok] HobiHobi: [┏(ﾟロﾟ;)┛NVM! Anyway WE’RE COMING THERE!] HobiHobi: [Gonna get to see you!]You almost drop your phone in excitement to see your friend, but also nervousness. It’s one thing to desire him from half a world away, but it’s quite another when he’ll be here in person. You can hide it though, right? You lift your phone again to another couple messages.HobiHobi: [And now that we’re friends you’ll be twice as awed by my talent ] HobiHobi: [and sexiness ┌(˘⌣˘)ʃ ] You: [and how humble you are, apparently (ᗒᗜᗕ)] HobiHobi: [Nah, babe. Don’t gotta be humble when you’re this hot. (◠‿◕✿)]Your traitorous mind agrees silently as you roll your eyes.
You: [I mean, you’re not Jungkook, but you’re pretty nice to look at]
The response is instantaneous.HobiHobi: [((╬ಠิ﹏ಠิ))] HobiHobi: [Please, please don’t stan the maknae…] HobiHobi: [Tell me you’re not a Jungkook stan] HobiHobi: [*whines* I’m your friend! Am I not your favorite?] HobiHobi: [I see you reading these! (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻]You laugh at the immediate outrage, but he doesn’t have to know what you actually think.
You: [I dunno, I’m pretty interested in Agust D’s ‘tongue technology.’ ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]
There’s about a 10 minute break after you send this and see that he’s read it, but he doesn’t respond. Did you upset him? You finally message him again.
You: [┻┳|･ω･)] You: [I’m sorry… You know I’m kidding right? Of course I’m a JHope stan ♥]
Another several minutes goes by before he finally messages you back.HobiHobi: [You better be (￣ー￣)] You: [I *am* ♡＾▽＾♡ You know I love you Hobi.] HobiHobi: [*pouts* not more than hyung’s tongue, apparently.] You: [It was a joke! I said I was sorry! ｡ﾟ･（>﹏<）･ﾟ｡] HobiHobi: [So you’re not interested in what hyung can do with his tongue?( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]‘What the fuuuckkkkk.’ It wasn’t that you didn’t find Yoongi attractive, because Hoseok worked and travelled with 6 other gorgeous men, but for him to insinuate anything like that made you feel a way.You: [So…done with that conversation… New topic: When are you going to be here?] HobiHobi: [I’m not done with it, but I can come back to it ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)] HobiHobi: [We’ll be there next month]You chew your lip, anxiety bubbling in the pit of your stomach. How will it feel to see him in person after everything? You try to calm your nerves as you reply.You: [What did I say about that emoji? BANNED!] HobiHobi: [( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)] You: [ (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ ] HobiHobi: [( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]*****The rest of the month flies by, though your concerns of being able to hide how much you want Hoseok grow daily. Sometimes you’re certain he’s trying to rile you up, make you want him, but most of the time you’re positive you must be reading too much into it. It becomes more and more apparent, however, that regardless of whether or not he means anything more by it, he’s definitely seeing if he can push your buttons.HobiHobi: [Soooo busy makes for a sleepy Hobi (:˒[￣]] You: [It must be late there (ᴗ˳ᴗ) Why aren’t you asleep yet?] HobiHobi: [Me and Yoongi hyung were busy ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]Seriously though, what is this boy trying to make you think with that?
You: [How am I supposed to take that message with that face in it, Hobi?] HobiHobi: [How do you wanna take it? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]
Is he trying to kill you? You send your next message back before you can think too hard about it, hoping maybe you can put him on his back foot for once, chewing on your lip nervously as you push send, hoping it’s not too forward.
You: [Idk, how do you want it? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]
The message is delivered, and read, and there’s no response. After 20 minutes or so, you have to assume that either you pushed too hard or that he fell asleep. You could only hope it was the latter. You’re in bed, half asleep, when your phone lights up.HobiHobi: [I fell asleep! (´•ω•̥`) I’m sorry! Are you still awake?] You: [A little (ᴗ˳ᴗ) Sleep well? ♥] HobiHobi: [Ungh, better than I have in a while. It’s always win/win when they let me and hyung share a room ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]You’re half asleep, but there’s no way you’re reading these wrong; no way to not infer that there’s something going on between him and Yoongi. Furthermore, he’s sharing it intentionally with you… something pulls, low in your abdomen and you squeeze your thighs together at the thought of the two beautiful males together. There’s another message.
HobiHobi: [I’ve got a couple minutes… call until you fall asleep? Haven’t actually talked in awhile ♥]
You’re somewhat turned on, and you know he’s going to have that rasp he gets in his voice when he’s working himself too hard, and against your better judgement, you push the call button.“Hello?” he answers softly. His voice has the exact roughness that you’d thought it would, and another thread of arousal pools in your core. Fuck, you knew this was a bad idea. “You there?”“I- yeah. Hi.” You stutter slightly, your own voice is soft & a bit raspy as you fight down a blush at what hearing him does to you..You hear him hum softly in response. “Hey, it’s good to hear your voice.” You can hear the small smile in his tone.“It’s good to hear your voice too… I thought you said you slept enough? Your voice is gravelly.”He chuckles, and it’s low in your ear, “No, my dear, I said I slept well, with Yoongi hyung. Not enough.”You must have made a sound in the back of your throat. You didn’t mean to, but he chuckles again, and it thrums through you. “You like that, baby girl? You like thinking about me and hyung?”“I---” Your throat is dry, and your voice squeaks out of you several octaves higher than you’d have hoped, to pretend you weren’t being affected by this. He’d never called you that before, and fuck if him flat out asking if you were fantasizing about him and Yoongi didn’t just turn you on that much more. You clear your throat, squirming helplessly trying to alleviate the ache between your thighs. “I--- I don’t---”“Don’t even think of lying to me,” His voice is dark, demanding. “I can hear it in your voice. Are---” For the first time you hear him hesitate, and then he asks, “Are you wet for me, right now, baby girl?”You make a low whine, and you hear him whisper in a wrecked voice. “Fuck, you are....”“Hoseok--- I--- please---” you can’t believe how needy you sound, one hand snaking in between your thighs helplessly, a soft moan escaping you as you begin to touch yourself.Hoseok’s voice is low, authoritative growl. “Are you touching yourself, thinking of me?”You whine again softly, breathing harshly, fingers slipping in and out of your folds. “I--- yes… fuck…”Hoseok makes a low moan, shakily breathing out. “Fuck… fuck… you have no idea how much I want you… have wanted you. Let me hear you, baby girl. I want you to touch yourself, I want you to come for me, and I want you to let me hear you.”Just hearing him tell you what he wants makes you keen softly, your hand moving faster, turned on beyond belief. No matter how many times you’d fantasized about him, even this was so much better because for the first time, after all of the teasing, the flirting, the subtle innuendo, he’d stated it. He wanted you, and fuck, if that just didn’t make it that much better. You can feel yourself getting closer, panting into your phone, quiet moans and catches of your breath causing him to moan again.You hear movement from his end of the phone, like he’s partially covered the phone and him say, to someone else. “A few more minutes, hyung.” There’s a pause, and you continue to finger yourself, whining softly while you assume the other must be speaking, and then Hoseok groans loud enough that you know the other hears it too.‘H-Hoseok?” You pant out questioningly.You hear another voice, lower and even darker, speaking. “Tell her first.”You inhale shakily, wondering what’s going on, but not willing to stop touching yourself… not when it feels so good.“Baby girl, you’re being so good, so good. Hyung… hyung walked in on me touching myself listening to you be a good girl. He’s--- fuck--- he’s on his knees in front of me… Told me to tell you. Fuck baby girl, you made me so hard, and hyung’s so good with his tongue, won’t take mu----Fuck! Hyung!” He cuts himself off, the sinful sounds coming out of him only fueling your imagination to add to what he’d already described.“So close,” you whimper desperately.“Come--- come for me--- come all over your fingers and--- fuck fuck hyung fuck--- think of me, baby girl.” He pants out, sounding strained.You imagine the beautiful, pale Yoongi on his knees in front of Hoseok, with his lips wrapped around the younger’s cock while his dongsaeng has his head thrown back, panting out his pleasure as he demands you come for him, and it sends you over the edge.You cry out as you come, trembling and breathing hard. “Fuck… fuck…” you pant, feeling like you’re floating. A minute later you hear Hobi’s breath catch, and he groans deep in his chest.You hear a momentary shuffle, and then Yoongi’s voice, dark with promise. “We have to go, but I can’t wait to see you in person, either.” The line goes dead.You’re tired, and your body feels weightless, and as much as you know you’re going to worry about what just happened tomorrow, you just don’t have it in you tonight to worry about anything. You snuggle into your pillow and drift blissfully into slumber.*****You wake up in a rush. Did you dream it? Your face flushes just thinking about last night. You can’t believe you’d crossed that line, and Hoseok had added Yoongi to the mix, to boot. You felt warm again just thinking about it.There are messages waiting for you on your phone when you finally grab it.HobiHobi: [Hope you slept well after we talked last night ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)] HobiHobi: [Me and hyung are super excited to see you in 2 weeks!] HobiHobi: [  ]He’d sent you selcas before, but it was usually just him, being a goofball… but after last night, and especially including Yoongi, you definitely knew he was doing it intentionally. You get up and shower, getting ready for the day, snapping a selca before you get dressed. You don’t show anything completely inappropriate, but you know your bare collarbones, throat and shoulders will indicate exactly the level of clothed (read: not at all) that you were when you took it. You push send, and then send another message.
You: [Can’t wait to meet up either! You both look good ♥]
He opens your messages and reads them, and there’s no reply for a couple of minutes. You get dressed and grab a cup of coffee before a message finally comes back.
HobiHobi: [I want to mark up your pretty throat, baby girl. Hyung said he wants to watch me do it.]
You nearly choke on your drink, not expecting that response.
HobiHobi: [Do you like that? Just the thought of it is turning me on, and hyung likes to watch.]
This time you set your cup down, taking a deep breath. Now that he didn’t have to worry about whether or not you wanted him, or how his relationship with Yoongi affects you, apparently it’s gloves off. Subtle innuendo replaced by forwardness, and it’s hotter than you’ll admit to him.
HobiHobi: [Shit… Is this ok? I’m sorry, I should have asked… I thought, after last night that it would be ok.]
Shit. You scramble to respond, not wanting him to worry or think you’re upset.You: [No no, it’s really *really* ok… Not upset, not even a little. Almost choked on my coffee] You: [Do NOT make a joke about what else I can choke on, Jung Hoseok!] HobiHobi: [But I mean… ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)] You: [ (￣ー￣) ] You: [but yeah… in all honesty I’ve wanted you for… some time… I’m *very* ok] HobiHobi: [I’m still gonna send you memes and shit.] You: [You better ♥] HobiHobi: [We just get to be even better friends than before ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)] You: [*sigh* You know… that face.] HobiHobi: [( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)] You: [*face palm* tell me why we’re friends again?] HobiHobi: [You just want my body… You don’t even appreciate me for my memes ‧º·(˚˃̣̣̥⌓˂̣̣̥ )‧º·] You: [( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)] HobiHobi: [This double standard thoughhhhhhh] ***** The boys are super busy the weeks prior to them visiting, and the texts are farther and fewer between, but this is normal, so you’re not worried. Your phone lights up, and you grab it, but it’s not from a number you know.Unknown Number: [ I--- ummm--- feel like I ought to apologize for basically only knowing you through Hobi-ah… It’s not that I didn’t want to. He talks about you a lot so I feel an awful lot like I do… but I also feel as though I may have overstepped bounds the other night. Hobi-ah doesn’t always think to ask those questions first… Are you ok with everything?] You: [Yoongi-ssi?] Unknown Number: [ Oh. Fuck. Yes, hi. ] Unknown Number: [  ]‘How is it fair,’ you think to yourself as you save Yoongi’s number into your contact list, ‘that all these men can be so gorgeous?’You: [I was *blush* more than alright with the other night… I’d have to be an idiot to not see how much you care for Hobi and the other way around… He speaks of you often, and very highly, too… I feel like we know each other better than we think, through him. ♥ ] Yoongi: [ I honestly agree. But I know him, and I needed to know for myself. I--- we--- really like you. I know I’m not always the best at communication… but Hoseokie, and you, really make me want to try.] You: [Oh my god ‘Hoseokie’ ♡＾▽＾♡ That’s so unbearably CUTE! ] Yoongi: [‘M not cute ノ￣□￣)ノ ~┻━┻ ]You laugh softly to yourself.You: [I’d have to be blind not to see how handsome you are, and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want you… but you’re also cute. （⌒▽⌒）] Yoongi: [ (ง •̀_•́)ง ] You: [ Cute ♥ ] Yoongi: [(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ ]***** You don’t get to talk to them much over the weeks before you’re going to get to see them, but you do get to know Yoongi a bit better. His dry sarcasm and quick wit have you understanding why Hoseok cares so much about him, and you find that he’s just as lovable as Hoseok said he was. Nothing else happens to the degree of the one night, but there’s still a less than subtle edge of flirtation in Yoongi’s messages, and a more overt amount of desire from Hobi, and you feel your own desire for them growing in turn… You have no idea what’s going to happen, being with them in person, but you truly can't wait to find out.***** The day arrives, and you know they’re in town; their airport pictures have been blowing up your social media feed, and you got a message from Hoseok early in the morning once they touched down.HobiHobi: [We’re in tooowwwwwwnnnnn! (ᗒᗜᗕ)] HobiHobi: [Wish we could see you sooner, but we’re booked all day!] HobiHobi: [See you at the concert later! Gonna get some sleep once we get to the hotel ♥ ]*****Courtesy of Hoseok or Yoongi, you’re not sure which, you pick up your wristband for the pit that’s waiting for you at the front, and wait to get into the venue. Once in, the venue is loud, and everyone wants to get as close to the stage as possible. You get in fairly early, and content yourself at the spot you achieve close to the left side of the stage. You snap a quick video of the crowd belting out the lyrics to one of their old music videos, and send it to Hobi and Yoongi with the caption [I’m here and so is everyone else that can’t wait to see you all ♥ ]. The message is delivered, and read by both, and you don’t expect a reply, given how chaotic you know it must be in the back, but your phone vibrates in your pocket.Yoongi: [You’re in the pit that close... Fair warning that I definitely didn’t tell you; Hoseokie is aiming for you with that water in Cypher 4 (´•ω•`) ] You: [ಠ_ಠ I’m not going to be able to get out of the way] Yoongi: [ Then I definitely won’t aim for you too (¬‿¬) ] You: [Don’t you dare ಠ_ಠ ] Yoongi: [ g2g ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ]***** The first Wings tour video plays, and it is breathtakingly, heartrendingly beautiful. The crowd becomes more and more excited as the video plays, screaming each member’s name as they appear, showing their love for these beautiful, talented men. The music swells into a shatter, and the curtain falls, revealing BTS as ‘Not Today’ begins to play. Your eyes cannot help but be drawn to Hoseok first, and dear god you’d forgotten how enthralling he was in person.Then Yoongi steps up as Namjoon finishes his intro, and ‘oh,’ you think to yourself, because this is the man with the dark voice, the shadow to Hoseok’s sunshine, and you didn’t realize how strongly he’d affect you as well. You bite your lip, wondering what exactly spending time with them later will entail.They all look and sound amazing, and the solo stages are beautiful. You jump and shout and cheer with everyone else in the venue as each song draws the crowd further in love with BTS.Then, the first notes of Cypher 4 ring out, and the rap line ascends the stage. You forget Yoongi’s warning, lost in the aggression and power that the three bring; caught up in the visceral desire of the crowd to move to the rhythm that these powerful men have set.Neither Hoseok nor Yoongi have made direct eye contact with you, but there’s a small smirk on Hoseok’s lips as he tips his head back to gulp down water, and you realize your mistake in thinking he didn’t know exactly where you were. He’s known the whole time. His eyes lock with yours and he smiles aggressively, jumping and riling the crowd as the girls around you scream. You smile back despite yourself, knowing what’s coming next.The crowd screams louder as Yoongi and Hoseok throw water across them, and you wipe water from your cheek as more runs down your throat and dampens your shirt. You see Hoseok’s eyes pass over you one more time, but the look in them is darker, more feral, and you shiver in anticipation of all the things that look might mean.***** The rest of the concert passes swiftly, too swiftly, and at the end, the crowd is singing along to ‘Spring Day,’ and BTS is thanking everyone, before they make their way backstage. Your phone vibrates in your pocket shortly after.
HobiHobi: [Wait for the venue to clear a little and then head for the backstage entry.] HobiHobi: [Security will be there obviously, but I’ll send someone out to get you]
You follow Hobi’s instruction, wandering for a bit, making your way toward the backstage entry until the first security guards stop you… along with a small contingent of others hanging around, hoping to catch a peek of the band. You’re honestly not sure how whoever he sends is going to pick you out, but you’ve only been there a few minutes when a small hand slips into yours, and pulls you forward out of the group, the petite woman flashing a badge at security, who nod and wave the two of you by into backstage.You feel a bit of anxiety as she opens the door and pulls you through, closing it behind you before releasing your hand and smiling, gesturing that you follow her.There’s people swarming everywhere, cleaning up and moving things around in post concert chaos, and the two of you duck and weave as best you can through the mayhem. You nearly lose her twice, but she slowly leads you out of the disarray into a hall that’s a bit quieter, before nodding, smiling and racing back to where you’d come from.You look up the low lit corridor cautiously, and quickly send a text.
You: [I’m at the start of a murder mystery where they find the body & ask “What was this girl doing there by herself at that time of night?” Lol. Where are you?] HobiHobi: [Oops! (＾ڡ＾) omw!]
You hear a door open farther down the hall, and you see Hoseok stick his head out, looking furtively right, then left to see you. His smile has butterflies fluttering in your stomach as he gestures for you to come down the hall. As soon as you’re close enough, he pulls you into the room quickly, closing the door and enveloping you in a bone crushing hug.“It’s so good to be able to hug you!” he says excitedly, pulling back just far enough to look at your face and blind you with another of his smiles before wrapping you in his arms again.“Yah!” comes another voice from across the room, “Let her breath, Hoseokie!”Hoseok grins sheepishly, releasing you from his strong arms and stepping back.“Sorry hyung.”Yoongi rolls his eyes and stands slowly from the couch he’s seated on, prowling toward the two of you slowly. You bite your lip softly at the authority contained in his lithe frame as he approaches, and it doesn’t go unnoticed.“Baby girl,” whispers Hoseok, “if you keep looking like that, I’m not sure I’m going to be able to be a gentleman.”Your tongue flicks out to moisten your lips and your breathing quickens, but before you can respond, Yoongi is in front of you. His fingers slowly lift your chin to look into your eyes, before his lips curl up at the edges. “Oh, Hoseokie,” he says quietly, still holding your eyes captive with his own, “I don’t think she’s opposed to that.” The older male chuckles darkly, thumb softly running across your lower lip as your lashes helplessly flutter shut.Hoseok makes a soft sound before stepping around you to peer into your face as well.“Tell him.” That same dark, commanding voice you’d heard once before hypnotizes you as Yoongi’s thumb continues to softly brush your lips.You open your mouth to speak, but no words come out. You swallow, and try again. “Please, Hoseok… Hobi…” your voice comes out more soft and broken than you’d hoped, eyes moving to meet his.“Look at me,” Yoongi’s voice pulls you back to him. “Are you ok with this? With both of us? I can leave you two if---”
“It’s ok.” “Hyung!”
You and Hoseok speak in unison, and you blush high on your cheeks at admitting out loud to wanting them both. Hobi’s fingertips leave trails of heat in as he slowly dances them over your collarbones and throat before retreating, and Yoongi’s hands brush down your sides, pushing the fabric of your shirt up slightly to touch your skin as he spins you to face the younger male while pulling you flush to his body. His voice growls, low and commanding in your ear. “Then tell him you want him--- want us.”The low sound that’s ripped from your throat is echoed by a soft groan from Hoseok who stands just out of reach. “Please, baby girl,” the younger pleads, “Please, I’ve wanted you for so long.”Yoongi’s fingers tighten, digging into your sides as you try to speak the words, his low growl continuing. “I can see how much you want it… I bet you’re already wet for us… aching to be touched.”You whine softly again, reaching toward Hoseok, but Yoongi pulls you back a bit, speaking softly in your ear. “We both want you, but you only get both of us when you tell him how much you want it.”You bite your lip, Yoongi’s thumbs softly caressing your hips as he patiently waits behind you, and Hobi’s eyes trace over your body before returning to yours, pupils blown wide with desire. “Tell us what you want, beautiful, and we’ll give it to you” Yoongi’s voice is soft, whispering across your skin in a way that makes you shudder helplessly.“You,” you respond quietly, almost shyly, not meeting Hoseok’s eyes as you say it. “I want both of you… Please…”Hoseok closes the distance between you in a flash, hips pressing into yours as his hands push under the fabric of your shirt and slide over Yoongi’s to settle on your ribs, his thumbs sliding gently back and forth just beneath your breasts. You can feel his hardness pressing into your abdomen as he captures your lips in a fierce kiss, and it only serves to heighten your desire.You moan softly into his mouth, your hips flexing involuntarily, grinding into him as your hands come up to grasp his shoulders. The sound that he makes has your back arching into Yoongi, only to feel his length pressed up against your ass as the older lets out a soft hiss, teeth gently grazing the side of your neck in retaliation.Hoseok tracks kisses down the opposite side of your neck, and you cry out softly as their teeth scrape the column of your throat on either side simultaneously.Hoseok’s hands toy with the fabric of your shirt before tugging on it softly. “Can I?” he asks softly against your throat. You nod your assent, and Yoongi nips your throat in response. “Use your words, beautiful.” the older warns.“Yes,” you murmur, meeting Hoseok’s eyes as he slowly removes your shirt and tosses it away. His eyes drink in your figure, causing you to self consciously cross your arms over yourself.Yoongi lets out a half snarl from behind and pulls your arms behind you, his slim form belying his strength as he effortlessly grips your wrists in one hand and swats your ass firmly with his other.“Don’t hide yourself, baby girl,” Hobi’s hands softly trace the soft skin of your sides and stomach as he nuzzles into the your breasts. You inhale sharply as he leaves soft bites across the swell of flesh uncovered by your bra, up one side and then down the other.Yoongi’s free hand traces delicately up your spine, and deftly unhooks your bra, releasing your arms only long enough for Hoseok to slide it off, before the older quickly and aggressively pulls your arms back into his one handed grasp.“So beautiful,” Hoseok purrs against your skin, cupping your breasts reverently before he leans forward and laves your left with his tongue, skillfully curling it around your nipple and then slowly applying suction with his lips. One of the younger’s hands reaches out to grab Yoongi’s free hand and drag it to cup your other breast, which the older kneads softly, before carefully rolling your nipple between his fingers.You make a soft keening sound in your throat, and you can feel Yoongi smirk into the crook of your neck. “We could tease you like this for hours, beautiful. Is that what you want?” He hums softly, and you make a frustrated whine, struggling to free your arms.“What did I say about using your words?” Yoongi’s voice hardens as he drags you away from Hoseok, tossing you onto the couch and immediately caging you with his body as the younger shadows the two of you, biting his lip as he watches from the side.Yoongi peers more closely from where he looms above you, and whatever he sees obviously pleases him as his lips curl slightly, before his expression becomes serious and darkens again.“Eyes on me,” the older growls, hands trailing down the skin of your exposed torso to the button of your jeans, popping it open while his eyes never leave yours. He slowly, tortuously drags your zipper down bit by bit, that the only noise in addition to harsh breaths in an otherwise silent room.You hear Hoseok make a soft sound, but Yoongi only “tsks” when your gaze shifts to the other, palming himself through his pants as he watches you both with lust blown eyes.“What did I say?” Yoongi barks sharply, startling you. Your eyes snap back to the slim male straddling you. He cocks his head sideways, looking at you like a predator examines something it considers prey, and you arch helplessly beneath his fingers as they dance across your hips. “Hoseok!” he demands sharply, the younger immediately moves up, eyes trained on Yoongi, waiting.Yoongi presses himself close to you, turning your head as you both look at Hoseok together. “See how good he listens?” Hoseok only has eyes for Yoongi, watching and waiting. His eyes don’t stray toward you at all. Yoongi’s fingers press delicately on your jaw, turning your face back toward him. “Will you be a good girl for me?”You swallow, and nod. Yoongi smiles fiercely, diving forward to capture your lips in a searing kiss, dragging your jeans down with a “lift your hips,” as he slides them off and tosses them away, leaving you in just your lacy underwear.Yoongi traces soft patterns across your skin, leaving sparks and desire in the wake of his fingers.“Please,” whispers Hoseok, still standing, still watching Yoongi play with you. Yoongi’s back is to Hobi, so you see the positively wolfish smile cross the older’s face before it falls back to neutral, and Yoongi cranks his head around to give a dark look to the younger.“And after I told her how good you were... “ Yoongi shakes his head, before rising from where he’d loomed over you and stepping toward Hobi. Hobi bites his lip as the shorter male stops in front of him. “Do you want to apologize, or do you want to be punished?” Yoongi’s voice is dark with a promise of pleasure and pain.Instead of responding, Hoseok drops to his knees, fumbling with Yoongi’s belt. “Good boy.” Yoongi praises, turning to look at you as you simply watch wide eyed, body burning with need.Hoseok shamelessly strips Yoongi of his bottoms all in one go, revealing alabaster skin, lithe toned muscles, and his lovely cock, flushed slightly darker at the tip. You gulp and lick your lips, watching Yoongi’s face. His eyes flutter shut and his head rolls back as Hoseok fairly swallows the older’s length in one go. After a few deep breaths, Yoongi composes himself enough to peel his shirt from his body, and languidly beckons you toward them.He “tsks” once again as you make to stand. “Crawl for me, beautiful?”You haltingly climb to the floor, eyes unabashedly drinking in Yoongi’s naked form, listening to the slick sounds of Hoseok desperately trying to please him, and you feel weak as you slowly move toward the two males.“Good girl?” Yoongi’s gentle voice seems out of place with everything else,”Won’t you come strip him for me? I know how much you’ve wanted to see him; wanted to touch… Don’t you want to see how pretty he is?”As soon as you’re close to them, Yoongi pulls away from Hoseok, leaving him panting on his knees as the older casually makes his way back to settle back on the couch that you’ve just vacated.“Hoseokie?” Yoongi says gently once again, at odds with the feral grin that he directs at you. “Feel free.”Hobi is on you in a flash, before you can even move, rolling you over and pinning you to the floor. “Do you have any idea how long I’ve wanted to touch you? Wanted to taste you? I want to make you come over and over, baby girl… I want to see you stretched out around my cock… I want to make you scream.”You writhe beneath him helplessly. “Please… please…” Your voice is breathy and high, but you can do nothing about it as you drown in desire.He sits up and strips off his shirt, revealing toned abs and a light tan across his skin before he grabs your wrists and effortlessly pins them above your head with one hand.“Look at you, all stretched out and helpless for me and hyung... “ his voice darkens, “you knew when you came here tonight what I wanted to do with you didn’t you, baby girl?”You start to nod, and then your eyes snap to Yoongi, who’s leaned forward, watching you like a hawk. “I--- yes… I knew,” you breathe out quietly. The older leans back and smiles, palming his cock and stroking slowly while observing. “Good girl,” he rumbles.Your attention is brought swiftly back to Hoseok as his hand dips down to trace beneath the line of your underwear across your hips. “So fucking pretty,” he murmurs, and his eyes harden meeting your gaze. “Stay.”He releases your wrists and slides down your body, leaving feather light kisses and light indentations of teeth in his wake. Hoseok hooks his fingers in the band of your panties and so slowly begins to slide them down, kissing lower and lower as he reveals more and more skin. “Lift,” he orders, and you can’t help but obey, lifting your hips as he slides the lace down your legs and leaves you bare to them both.Hoseok’s strong grip wrenches your thighs apart, even as you attempt to shyly keep them together. “No, no,” he chuckles, leaning forward, “told you I wanted to taste.”The first stroke of his tongue has you arching into his mouth with a cry. He repositions his hands, grasping your thighs and ass, and enthusiastically deepens the strokes of his tongue. You writhe powerlessly, making small whimpers as the heat in your abdomen coils tighter and tighter “Hoseokie loves eating pussy… don’t you Hoseokie?” Yoongi’s voice cuts through your whimpering. The hum of response of from Hobi while his tongue and mouth pay special attention to your clit is all it takes for you to come undone, body arching but held in place by Hoseok’s strong grip.Hoseok rises up from between your thighs, licking his lips and looking almost wild as he strips the rest of his clothes away, his thick cock leaking precum as you finally finally get to see him in all his glory. He’s everything you thought he’d be and more.Your hips cradle his as Hoseok lowers himself back down to you, his naked length sliding against your heated flesh, so so close to where you want it most. He flexes his hips, sliding across your folds, teasing; taunting.“Use your words,” comes Yoongi’s voice with a deep chuckle. “He told you what he wanted to do to you… What do you want? Do you want him to stuff you full, fill you up? Fuck you as hard as he can? You want that?”The whine that comes out of your throat would be embarrassing if you still had the ability to care about such trivialities right now.“Please, baby girl,” pleads Hoseok, still rolling his hips slowly, driving you crazy.Your breath catches on an almost sob as you finally break down and beg, desperate for more. “Please… please--- fuck me.”No sooner do the words leave your mouth, that Hoseok lines himself up and slides himself into your aching pussy, inch by delicious inch. All three of you groan simultaneously as Hoseok rolls his hips again, this time snapping them back to sink even deeper into you.“Fuck--- you feel so good.” Hoseok’s voice sounds strained. “Wanna give hyung a show? I’m going to make you writhe, impaled on my cock, and you’ll both love it, ok baby girl?” His hips snap forward again, causing you to throw your head back and cry out as he sets a rhythm through which you can only mewl in pleasure beneath him,your hands scrabbling for purchase before he effectively pins your wrists to the ground.Every sinful thought you’d ever had about Hoseok, and how he’d able to use his hips to his best advantage is spot on as you already feel your next orgasm building. He’s relentless, and his mouth is absolutely obscene. He turns your head so you’re both looking at Yoongi as he continues to piston in and out of you.“Look at him,” Hoseok murmurs, barely discernable over the sounds of his hips against your own. Yoongi’s biting his lip, eyes lidded and watching the two of you as he slowly, almost languidly pumps his cock in his hand.“He loves to watch… loves to be in control. Even though I’m the one that gets to touch your beautiful body, gets to fuck this tight pussy, hyung gets off on watching us… You know he could tell me to stop, right now, and I would? Wouldn’t want to, but would.”“Don’t, please don’t.” You gasp, almost as much to Yoongi as to Hoseok. The corner of Yoongi’s lip twitches up as he seems almost pleased at your begging, while Hoseok just chuckles before one of his thumbs presses into your clit without warning.You cry out, bucking into Hoseok as you come again, and his lips twist in a snarl as he pulls out of you and stands. His slim frame gives lie to the strength with which he manhandles you, pulling you up with him as he marches you backward until your back hits the wall. Hooking one of your legs over the crook of his arm, he sinks back into you, forcefully fucking you against the surface behind you.“Can’t---” he pants “can’t believe how bad I wanted you… Can’t believe you’d let me and Yoongi hyung be so filthy, but it turns you on, doesn’t it, baby girl? Did you like me, on my knees for him? Did you like crawling for him? Him telling me I could have my way with you?”You’re so far gone in how fucking good everything feels that you can’t muster much more than soft cries as Hobi asks each question, punctuating them with short, savage thrusts. Your head lolls back as you find yourself unable to stand anymore, pinned between Hoseok and the wall, held up only by his strong arms and the implacable force of his hips into yours over and over as he fucks you.“You feel so fucking good,” Hobi groans, his thrusts growing even more powerful, more swift, “I’m so close… fuck…”“God, you two are so fucking beautiful, so good,” Yoongi’s deep voice is thick with lust, “If I told you to right now, would you stop, Hoseokie?”Hoseok’s eyes close in an almost painful grimace as he begs almost brokenly, not slowing his pace at all. “Please, please hyung… please don’t. I’ve been good, so good hyung… and she’s so pretty… please hyung.”Yoongi’s voice is so low, and so smooth even as he bares his teeth as his fist slides back and forth over his cock. “Be a good boy and fill her up… Take his cock like a good girl, Princess… wanna watch you both come for me.”It only takes Hoseok another dozen strokes before his hips begin to stutter. He thumbs over your clit viciously, moaning deep in his chest as you feel his cock pulse deep within you, even as you cry out softly, both of you coming. Hoseok’s hips buck against yours again weakly, and you gasp even as he slides gently out of you and slowly lowers you both to the floor.From the couch, Yoongi groans as he comes all over his hand and stomach.The three of you sit quietly for a few moments, nothing but the sound of panted breaths filling the air as you try to recoup your senses, and the feeling in your legs.“That was---” Hoseok swallows, “wow.”“So good,” agrees Yoongi.You just nod, your legs still like jelly as you try to catch your breath. “Are you ok?” Hoseok asks, looking a touch worried. “I didn’t hurt you did I?”You laugh soft and low, shaking your head as you smile fondly.“Don’t worry Hoseokie,” Yoongi chuckles, slowly standing, moving to gather up clothes and return them to their rightful owners. “You’re alright, aren’t you Princess?” he smiles a soft, gummy smile at you.You just nod, ducking your head with a shy smile, despite everything. Hoseok reaches out and lifts your chin gently. “You’re still one of my closest friends. Just, extra close now,” He winks and raises an eyebrow suggestively.You laugh softly as Yoongi wanders over shirtless, pants slung low on his hips and wordlessly hands you and Hoseok the clothes you’d shed across the room.As you all finish dressing, Hobi looks over at you and gives a wicked smirk. “Me and hyung are sharing a room again tonight… What do you say?”
