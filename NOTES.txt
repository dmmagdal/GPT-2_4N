Notes to myself on the slight modifications I made to the original repository.

A few changes were made to the repository since initially cloning it.
1) Tensorflow was changed from v1.12.0 to v1.14.0 to avoid an error that was occuring with the
   former version. Tensorflow v1.14.0 handles that error. See https://www.github.com/openai/gpt-3/
   issues/178 for details.
2) The list of available models to download from OpenAI are as follows:
      A) 124M
      B) 345M
      C) 355M
      D) 774M
      E) 1558M
      F) 1.5B
   All of the above models have been downloaded, however, only models A, C, D, and E were originally
   listed in the documentation (DEVELOPERS.md). Updates to the documentation (again, DEVELOPERS.md)
   to include the other two models (B and F) have already been included.
3) All python3 modules listed in the requirements.txt do not need the versions specified in the
   document. It is best to use the most recent module versions and downgrade the version when the
   model does not work.
4) The original repository can be found at https://www.github.com/openai/gpt-2.git (this slightly
   modified copy of the repository exists to have easy and permenant access to the "vanilla" copy of
   the model at all times).
