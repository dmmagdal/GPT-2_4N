A WORD AT STARTING

[Illustration]

ONLY a few years before MR. PUNCH began his long and brilliant career
had passenger trains and a regular system of railway travelling come
into existence. In his early days it was still very much of a novelty to
undertake a journey of any length by train; a delightful uncertainty
prevailed not only as to the arrival at a given destination, but equally
as to getting away from a starting-place. Naturally, the pens and
pencils of his clever contributors were then frequently in use to
illustrate the humours of railway travel, and even down to the present
time MR. PUNCH has not failed to find in the railway and its
associations "a source of innocent merriment."

It must be admitted that some thirty years ago the pages of PUNCH
literally teemed with biting satires on the management of our railways,
and the fact that his whole-hearted denunciations of the inefficient
service, the carelessness which resulted in frequent accidents, the
excessive charges, the inadequate accommodation, could have been allowed
to pass without numerous actions for libel, is proof of the enormous
advantages which the present generation enjoys in this great matter of
comfortable, rapid and inexpensive transit. Where MR. PUNCH in his
wrath, as voicing the opinion of the public, was wont to ridicule and
condemn the railways and all associated therewith, we to-day are as
ready, and with equal reason, to raise our voice in praise. But ridicule
is ever a stronger impulse to wit than is appreciation, and in these
later days when we are all alive to the abounding merits of our railway
system MR. PUNCH has had less to say about it. If we were to cull from
his pages written in the days of his wrath we might be held guilty of
presenting a gross travesty of the conditions now obtaining. Thus it is
that in one or two cases only have we retained passages from his earlier
chronicles, such as "Rules for the Rail" and "The Third-Class
Traveller's Petition," which have some historical value as reminders
that the railway comfort of the present day presents a remarkable
contrast to the not very distant past.

To-day every member of the community may be regarded as a railway
traveller, so large a part does the railway play in modern life; and it
will be admitted that, with all our improvements, the element of humour
has not been eliminated from our comings and goings by train. We trust
it never may. Here, then, is a compilation of the "best things,"
literary and pictorial, that have appeared in MR. PUNCH'S pages on the
subject, and with his cheery presence as our guard, let us set forth
upon our excursion into the Realm of Fun!

MR. PUNCH'S RAILWAY BOOK

RAILWAY JOKES

_As Played Daily on the Principal Lines_

_Turning Business into Pleasure._--Take a traveller pressed for time,
and induce him to enter a train supposed to be in correspondence with
another train belonging to another line, and by which other train the
traveller proposes to proceed to his destination. As the first train
arrives at the junction, start off the second train _en route_ for Town.
The dismay of the traveller when he finds his journey interrupted will
be, to say the least, most mirth-moving.

_The Panic-stricken Passengers._--Allow an express train to arrive at
the station of a rival company two hours behind its time. The travellers
will, of course, be anxious to learn the cause of the delay, and will
(again of course) receive no sort of information on the subject from
the servants of the rival company. Should there be any nervous ladies in
the train, the fun will become fast and furious.

_A Lark in the Dark._--Start a train ten minutes late, and gradually
lose time until it arrives in the middle of a long tunnel, and then stop
the engine. Stay where you are for half an hour, whistling and letting
off steam every now and then, to increase the excitement. Should it be
known in the train that an express is due on the line of rails already
occupied by the carriages, the humour of the situation will be greatly
improved. Before playing this joke, it will be as well to lock the
carriage-doors, and to carefully sever the cord of communication
existing (on some lines) between the passengers and the guard.

_A Comical Meal._--On a long journey promise that the train shall stop
at a stated station ten minutes for refreshments. Lose time in the
customary manner, and allow the train to arrive at the stated station
half an hour late. Permit the passengers to descend and to enter the
refreshment-rooms. The moment they are served, drive them back hurriedly
into the carriages with the threat that if they are not immediately
seated in their places they will be left behind. When the passengers are
once more in their compartments, the carriage-doors should be securely
locked, and the train can then remain waiting beside the platform for
three-quarters of an hour.

_The Strange Companions._--Invite ladies and gentlemen to travel in a
first-class carriage. When the compartment is a third full, over-fill it
with "merry" excursionists holding third-class tickets. The contrast
between the "merriment" of the excursionists and the disgust of the
ladies and gentlemen will be found a source of never-ending amusement.

_A Wholesome Joke (added by Mr. Punch and suggested to the
Passengers)._--Whenever you find yourselves subjected to the "fun" of
the railway officials, write to the newspapers and obtain a summons
against the directors of the company which you believe to be in fault.
_Verb. sap._

THE MISSING SPINSTER

  You may boast your great improvements,
  Your inventions and your "movements,"
    For those who stay at home, and those who travel;
  But arrangements for the latter
  Are so complex, that the matter
  Makes them dotty as a hatter
                  To unravel.

  There was once an ancient lady
  Whom we knew as Miss O'Grady,
    Who was asked to spend the autumn down at Trew.
  So in fear and trepidation
  She sought out her destination,
  And betook her to the station--
                  Waterloo.

  She took her little ticket
  And she did not fail to stick it
    With half-a-dozen coppers in her glove.
  Another moment found her
  With a plenty to astound her--
  For she'd notice-boards all round her,
                  And above!

  So she studied every number
  On those sign-posts that encumber
    All the station; and she learned them one by one;
  But she found the indication
  Of the platforms of the station
  Not much use as information
                  When she'd done.

  In her shocking state of fluster
  Little courage could she muster,
    Yet of porters she accosted one or two;
  But, too shy to claim attention,
  And too full of apprehension,
  She could get no one to mention
                  "Which for Trew."

  So she trudged through every station--
  "North," "South," "Main,"--in quick rotation,
    And then she gave a trial to the "Loop";
  Like some hapless new Pandora
  She sat down a-gasping for a
  Little hope to live on--or a
                  Plate o' soup.

           * * * * *

  'Mid the bustle and the hissing
  An old maiden lady's "Missing"--
    In some corner of the complicated maze;
  And round about she's gliding
  In unwilling, hideous hiding,
  On the platform, loop, or siding,
                  In a craze.

  And still they cannot find her,
  For she leaves no trace behind her
    At Vauxhall, Clapham Junction, Waterloo;
  But she passes like a comet
  With the myst'ry of Mahomet--
  Her course unknown--and from it
                  Not a clue!

little gals with lots o' boxes? I'm good for a pint!"]

gave me half-a-sovereign too much! Ta-ta!"     _[Exit._

REPARTEES FOR THE RAILWAY

"No smoking allowed." Of course, but I am going to enjoy my cigar in
silence.

"Want the window closed." Very sorry, but I can't find a cathedral.

"Find my journal a nuisance." Dear me! was under the impression it was a
newspaper.

"Allow you to pass." Afraid only the Secretary can manage that for you;
he alone has power to issue free tickets.

"Do I mind the draught?" Not when I am attending to the chessman.

"Do I know the station?" Of the people on the platform? Probably lower
middle class.

"Is this right for Windsor?" Yes, if it's not left for somewhere else.

"Are we allowed five minutes for lunch?" Think not; but you can have
sandwiches at the counter.

"Isn't this first-class?" Quite excellent--first-rate--couldn't be
better!

"I want to go second." Then you had better follow me.

"I am third." Indeed! And who were first and second.

"I think this must be London." Very likely, if it is, it mustn't be
anywhere else.

there?"

THE THIRD-CLASS TRAVELLER'S PETITION

  (1845)

  Pity the sorrows of a third-class man,
    Whose trembling limbs with snow are whitened o'er,
  Who for his fare has paid you all he can:
    Cover him in, and let him freeze no more!

  This dripping hat my roofless pen bespeaks,
    So does the puddle reaching to my knees;
  Behold my pinch'd red nose--my shrivell'd cheeks:
    You should not have such carriages as these.

  In vain I stamp to warm my aching feet,
    I only paddle in a pool of slush;
  My stiffen'd hands in vain I blow and beat;
    Tears from my eyes congealing as they gush.

  Keen blows the wind; the sleet comes pelting down,
    And here I'm standing in the open air!
  Long is my dreary journey up to Town,
    That is, alive, if ever I get there.

  Oh! from the weather, when it snows and rains,
    You might as well, at least, defend the poor;
  It would not cost you much, with all your gains:
    Cover us in, and luck attend your store.

       *       *       *       *       *

[Illustration: A CAUTION

No wonder Miss Lavinia Stitchwort thought the people very rude at the
station when she went for her "water-proof" (which she had lost on the
railway some time before). She found out when she got home she had not
removed the "unclaimed property" label!]

THE ORIGIN OF RAILWAYS.--The first idea of railways is of very ancient
date, for we hear of the Great Norman line immediately after the
Conquest.

       *       *       *       *       *

RAILWAY NEWS.--There is an old lady who says, that she always likes to
travel by a trunk line, because then she feels confidence about the
safety of her luggage.

       *       *       *       *       *

RAILWAY REFORM.--Compartments to be reserved for ladies over and under a
certain age.

As there will invariably be compartments for those who smoke, so also
for those who snuff. The former will be labelled as usual "for Smokers,"
the latter "for Snuffers." The last-mentioned will be tried as far as
Hampton Wick.

The "Sleeping Cars" will be divided into "Snorers" and "Non-Snorers."
Tickets will be issued subject to these regulations.

It is important to the Shareholders to know that on and after the
abolition of the Second Class, the motto of the Company will be "No
Returns."

A PLUTOCRAT.--_Swell._ "'Dyou oblige me--ah--by shutting your
window?--ah----"

_Second Passenger (politely)._ "Really, sir, if you will not press it,
as yours is shut, the air is so warm I would rather keep this open. You
seem to take great care of yourself, sir----"

_Swell._ "Care of myself! Should wather think so. So would you, my dear
fel-lah, if you'd six thousand a ye-ar!!"

       *       *       *       *       *

THE SLOW TRAIN

  On Southern lines the trains which crawl
    Deliberately to and fro
  Make life a burden; of them all
    This is the slowest of the slow.
  Impatiently condemned to bear
    What is indeed an awful bore,
  I've seemed to be imprisoned there
                Three days, or more.

  The angry passengers complain;
    Of new electric cabs they talk.
  They sit and swear at such a train,
    And ask, "Shall we get out and walk?"
  It's true the time seems extra long
    When spent in such a wretched way,
  My calculation may be wrong--
                Three hours, say.

  The other day I had to come
    By this slow train, but facing me
  Was no old buffer, dull and dumb;
    I chatted with my vis-à-vis.
  A pretty smile, a pretty dress,
    Gay spirits no fatigue could crush;
  With her it was a quick express,
                Three minutes' rush.

  For once I sadly left the train,
    For once the time too quickly passed.
  I still could angrily complain,
    Why travel so absurdly fast?
  At lightning speed that special went
    (I'd paid the ordinary fare),
  Now looking back it seems we spent
                Three seconds there.

"THE MORE HASTE THE WORSE SPEED"

SCENE--_The Charing Cross Station of the District Railway._

_Country Cousin, bound for Bayswater, to ticket clerk, with scrupulous
politeness._ If you please, I want a first-class ticket to Bayswater.

_Ticket Clerk (abruptly)._ No first-class here. Go to the next
booking-place.

  [_Country Cousin retires rebuffed, and finds his way to next
  booking-place._

_Country Cousin._ If you please, I want a first-class ticket to
Bayswater.

_Ticket Clerk (explosively)._ Single or return? Look sharp! You're not
the only person in London!

_Country Cousin (humbly)._ Single, please.

  [_The ticket and change are slapped down unceremoniously, and Country
  Cousin is shoved on from behind by an impatient City man. Rushes
  precipitately down brass-bound steps, and presents his ticket to be
  snipped._

_Snipper (inspecting ticket)._ Queen's Road, Bayswater? Wrong side! Go
up the stairs, and turn to the right. Look sharp! There's a train just
coming in!

  [_Country Cousin, with a deepened sense of humiliation and bewilderment,
  hurries upstairs, turns to the right, and reaches entrance to platform
  just in time to have gate slammed in his face. The train being gone,
  gate is re-opened, and the necessary snipping performed on his ticket._

_Country Cousin (to Snipper, politely)._ If you please--will the next
train take me to Queen's Road, Bayswater?

_Saturnine Official._ Can't tell you till the train comes.

  [_Country Cousin paces the platform in moody silence, and wishes he had
  taken a cab. Enter train, rushing madly along._

_Stentorian voice (without stops)._ Earl's Court North End and
Hammersmith train first and second-class forward third behind!

  [_Country Cousin makes his way towards a carriage, but finds it full.
  Tries another with the same result, and is frantically endeavouring to
  open the door of a third-class compartment in which there is one vacant
  seat next a fat woman with a baby, when train moves on._

_Indignant Official._ Stand away there! Stand away, will you! (_Drags
back Country Cousin._) That ain't your train! What do you want a-tryin
to get in there for?

  [_Country Cousin, in deeper humiliation, re-arranges dress, disturbed by
  recent struggle and resumes his agitated march._

_Enter another train more madly than the first._

_Stentorian voice._ High Street Kensington Notting Hill Gate and
Bayswater train main line train!

_Country Cousin (to Haughty Official, in an agony of entreaty)._ Is this
train for Queen's Road, Bayswater?

_Haughty Official._ Yes, Queen's Road. Look sharp! She'll be off in a
minute.

  [_Country Cousin scrambles through the crowd to a carriage; drops his
  umbrella; stoops to pick it up and on rising finds train three parts
  through the tunnel. Exit Country Cousin in a rage, to get a cab, having
  lost twenty minutes, the price of his unused ticket, his self-respect,
  and that of everybody he has come in contact with in the Metropolitan
  District Railway Station._

  Puff me the sea-breeze, and pleasantly fan it
    Into my nostrils--but don't leave the rails.

  Puff me away, far from Parliament's houses;
    For brown moors of Scotland my soul is athirst--
  For a smell of the heather, a pop at the grouses;
    Puff me, but mind that your boiler don't burst.

  Puff me _en route_ for care-killing Killarney,

  Bear me towards Erin, blest birthplace of Blarney,

  Alas! thou art a faithless friend,
    Thy warmth was but dissimulation;
  Thy tepid glow is at an end,
    And I am nowhere near my station!

  I shiver, cold in feet and hands,

VOCES POPULI

  I

SCENE--_Interior of Third-Class Smoking Compartment. First Passenger,
apparently a small Suburban Tradesman, of a full and comfortable habit,
seated by window. To him enters a seedy but burly Stranger, in a state
of muzzy affability, with an under-suggestion of quarrelsomeness._

_The Stranger (leaning forward mysteriously)._ Yer saw that gentleman I
was a torkin' to as I got in? Did yer know 'oo he _was_?

_First Passenger (without hauteur, but with the air of a person who
sets a certain value on his conversation)._ Well, he didn't look much
like the Archbishop of Canterbury.

_The S._ He's a better man than _'im_! That was Brasher, the middling
weight! he giv' me the orfice straight about Killivan and Smifton, _he_
did!

_First P. (interested, as a lover of the Noble Art of Self Defence)._
Ah! did he, though?

_The S._ He _did_; I went up to him, and I sez, "Excuse me," I sez,
like that, I sez, "but are you an American, or a German?"

_First P. (with superiority)._ He wouldn't like that--being taken for a
German.

_The S. (solemnly)._ Those were my very words! And he sez, "No, I'm a
Yank," and then I knoo 'oo 'e was, d'ye see? and so (_hazily_) one word
brought up another, and we got a torkin'. If I was to tell you I'd
_seen_ Killivan, I should be tellin' yer a lie!

_First P._ Well, I won't ask you to do that.

_The S. (firmly)._ Nor I wouldn't. But you've on'y to look at Smifton to
see 'e's never 'ad a smack on the 'ed. Now, there's Sulton--'e's a
_good_ man, _'e_ is--'e _is_ a good man! Look 'ow that feller knocks
'isself about! But if I was to pass _my_ opinion, it 'ud be
this--Killivan's _in_ it for science, he ain't in it to _take_ anything;
you may take that from me!

_First P._ (_objecting to be treated as an_ ingénu). It's not the first
time I've heard of it, by a long way.

_The S._ Ah! and it's the truth, the Bible truth (_putting his hand on
First P.'s knee_). Now, you b'leeve what I'm a'goin' to tell yer?

_First P. (his dignity a little ruffled)._ I will--if it's anything in
reason.

_The S._ It's this: My opinion of Killivan and Sulton's this--Sulton
_brought_ Killivan _out_. I'm on'y tellin' yer from 'earsay, like; but I
_know_ this myself--one lived in 'Oxton, and the other down Bermondsey
way. 'E's got a nice little butcher's business there at this present
moment; and 'e's a mug if 'e turns it up!

_First P. (axiomatically)._ Every man's a mug who turns a good business
up.

_The S._ Yer right! And (_moralising_) it ain't _all_ 'oney with that
sort o' people, neither, I can tell yer! I dessay, now, when all's put
to the test, you're not a moneyed man--no more than I am myself?

_First P. (not altogether flattered)._ Well--that's as _may_ be.

_The S._ But I b'leeve yer to be a man o' the world, although I don't
_know_ yer.

_First P. (modestly)._ I used to be in it at one time.

_The S. (confidentially)._ I'm in it _now_. I don't get my livin' by it,
though, mind yer. I'm a mechanic, I am--to a certain extent. I've been
in America. _There's_ a country now--they don't over-tax like they do
'ere!

_First P. (sympathetically)._ There you _'ave_ touched a point--we're
taxed past all common sense. Why, this very tobacco I'm smoking now is
charged----

_The S._ Talkin' of terbaccer, I don't mind 'aving a pipe along with yer
myself.

_First P. (handing his pouch with a happy mixture of cordiality and
condescension)._ There you are, then.

_The S. (afflicted by sudden compunction as he fills his pipe)._ I 'ope
I'm not takin' a libbaty in askin yer?

_First P._ Liberty? rubbish! I'm not one to make distinctions where _I_
go. I'd as soon talk to one man as I would another--you're setting your
coat alight.

_The S._ I set fire to myself once, and I never live in 'opes of doing
so agen! It's a funny thing with me, I can smoke a cigar just as well as
I could a short pipe. I'm no lover of a cigar, if you understand me; but
I can go into company where they _are_, d'ye _see_?

_First P. (shortly)._ _I_ see.

_The S. (with fresh misgivings)._ You'll excuse me if I've taken a
libbaty with yer!

_First P. (with a stately air)._ We settled all that just now.

_The S. (after a scrutiny)._ I tell yer what my idear of _you_ is--that
you're a _Toff!_

_First P. (disclaiming this distinction a little uneasily)._ No,
no--there's nothing of the toff about _me!_

_The S. (defiantly)._ Well, you're a _gentleman_, anyway?

_First P. (aphoristic, but uncomfortable)._ We can all of us be that,
so long as we behave ourselves.

_The S. (much pleased by this sentiment)._ Right agen! give us yer
'and--if it's not takin a libbaty. I'm one of them as can't bear to take
a libbaty with no matter 'oo. Yer know it's a real pleasure to me to be
settin' 'ere torkin' comfortably to you, without no thought of either of
us fallin' out. There's some people as wouldn't feel 'appy, not without
they was 'aving a row. Now you and me ain't _like_ that!

_First P. (shifting about)._ Quite so--quite so, of course!

_The S._ Not but what if it was to come to a row between us, I could
take _my_ part!

_First P. (wishing there was somebody else in the compartment)._ I--I
hope we'll keep off that.

_The S. (devoutly)._ So do I! _I_ 'ope we'll keep off o' that. But yer
never know what may bring it on--and there it is, d'ye see! You and me
might fall out without intending it. I've bin a bit of a boxer in my
day. Do you doubt my word?--if so, say it to my face!

_First P._ I've no wish to offend you, I'm sure.

_The S._ I never take a lie straight from any man, and there you 'ave me
in a word! If you're _bent_ on a row, you'll find me a glutton, that's
all I can tell you!

_First P. (giving himself up for lost)._ But I'm _not_ bent on a
row--qu--quite otherwise!

_The S._ You should ha' said so afore, because, when my back's once put
_up_, I'm--'ello! we're stopping, I get out 'ere, don't I?

_First P. (eagerly)._ Yes--make haste, they don't stay long anywhere on
this line!

_The S. (completely mollified)._ Then I'll say good-bye to yer.
(_Tenderly._) P'raps we may meet agen, some day.

_First P._ We--we'll hope so--good day to you, wish you luck!

_The S. (solemnly)._ Lord _love_ yer! (_Pausing at door._) I 'ope you
don't think me the man to fall out with nobody. I _never_ fall out----

[_Falls out into the arms of a porter, whom he pummels as the train
moves on, and First Passenger settles into a corner with a sigh of
relief._

Traveller in possession. Enter, suddenly, a Male Traveller._

_Male Traveller._ A thousand apologies! I really nearly missed my train,
so was obliged to take refuge in this carriage. Trust I don't intrude.

_Fem. T. (after a pause)._ As you have no one to present you, I must ask
"if you are any lady's husband?"

_Male T. (with a sigh)._ Alas, no! I am a wretched bachelor!

_Fem. T. (drily)._ That is nothing out of the common. I have been given
to understand that all bachelors are miserable.

_Male T._ No doubt your husband agrees with the opinion?

_Fem. T. (calmly)._ I have no experience. I am a spinster.

_Male T. (smiling)._ Indeed! And you selected a ladies' carriage?

_Fem. T. (quickly)._ Because there was no room anywhere else.

_Male T._ Well, well! At the next station I can get into a smoking
compartment.

_Fem. T._ Surely there is no need to take so much trouble.

_Male T._ Why! don't _you_ object to a cigar?

_Fem. T._ Not in the least. The fact is, I smoke myself!

  [_Red fire and tobacco._

_Male T. (after a pause)._ I have it on my conscience to make a
correction. I said just now that I was not somebody's husband.

_Fem. T. (annoyed)._ Then you are married!

receive me as somebody's betrothed.

RAILWAY MAXIMS

(_Perfectly at the Service of any Railway Company_)

Delays are dangerous.

A train in time saves nine.

Live and let live.

After a railway excursion, the doctor.

Do not halloo till you are out of the train.

Between two trains we fall to the ground.

Fire and water make good servants but bad masters.

A director is known by the company he keeps.

A railway train is the thief of time.

There is no place like home--but the difficulty is to get there.

The farther you go, the worse is your fare.

It's the railway pace that kills.

The great charm about a railway accident is that, no matter how many
lives are lost, "no blame is ever attached to any one."

A railway is long, but life is short--and generally the longer a
railway, the shorter your life.

RAILWAY SCALE OF MANNERS

We have often been struck with the difference of manner assumed by
railway officials towards different people. Shut your eyes, and you can
tell from the tone of their voices whom they are addressing. The
following examples will best illustrate our meaning. The railway
potentate is calling upon the passengers to get their tickets ready. He
calls:

To the Third Class.--_Fortissimè._--"Tickets, tickets; come get
your tickets ready."

To the Second Class.--_Fortè._--"Tickets, gents; get your tickets ready,
gents."

To the First Class.--_Piano._--"Get your tickets ready, gentlemen, if
you please; tickets ready, if you please, gentlemen."

TEA IN TEN MINUTES

(A SONG AT A RAILWAY STATION)

AIR--"_Thee, Thee, only Thee_"

  Ten minutes here! The sun is sinking,
  And longingly we've long been thinking
        Of Tea, Tea, fragrant Tea!
  The marble slabs we gather round.
    They're long in bringing what is wanted,
  The china cup with draught em-brown'd,
    Our thirsty souls are wholly haunted
        By Tea, Tea, fragrant Tea!

  Now then, you waiter, stir, awaken!
  Time's up. I'll hardly save my bacon.
        Tea, Tea, bring that Tea!
  At last! The infusion's rayther dark.
    But hurry up! Can't stay for ever!
  One swig! Br-r-r-r! Hang the cunning shark!
    Will't never cool? Nay, never, never!
        Tea, Tea, scalding Tea!

  More milk; don't be an hour in bringing!
  Heavens! That horrid bell is ringing!
        "Take your seats, please!" Can't _touch_ the Tea!
  Cup to the carriage must not take;
    Crockery may be lost, or broken;
  Refreshment sharks are wide awake.
    But--many a naughty word is spoken
        O'er Tea, Tea, scalding Tea!

RAILWAY COMPANIONS

(_By a Disagreeable Traveller_)

I.

I have come to the conclusion that the railway train exercises a
sinister influence upon the human race. Persons who are tolerable--or
even welcome--in ordinary daily life, become peculiarly obnoxious so
soon as they enter the compartment of a train. No fairy prince ever
stepped into a railway train--assuming he favoured that means of
locomotion--without being transformed straightway into a Beast, and even
Beauty herself could not be distinguished from her disagreeable
sisters--in a train.

Speaking for myself, railway travelling invariably brings to the surface
all my worst qualities.

My neighbour opposite hazards some remark. I feel immediately a fit of
taciturnity coming over me, and an overpowering inclination to retreat
behind a fortification of journals and magazines. On the other hand, say
that I have exhausted my stock of railway literature--or, no remote
possibility, that the literature has exhausted me--then I make a casual
remark about the weather. The weather is not usually considered a
controversial topic: in railway trains, however, it becomes so.

"Rain! not a bit," says a passenger in the far corner, evidently
meditating a walking tour, and he views me suspiciously as if I were a
rain-producer.

"And a good thing too," remarks the man opposite. "It's wanted badly, I
tell you, sir--very badly. It's all very well for you holiday folk,"
&c., &c.

And all this bad feeling because of my harmless well-intentioned remark.

The window is up. "Phew!... stuffy," says the man opposite. "You don't
mind, I hope, the window--eh?" "Not in the least," I say, and conceive a
deadly hatred for him. I know from experience that directly that window
is down all the winds of heaven will conspire to rush through, bearing
upon them a smoky pall. I resign myself, therefore, to possible
bronchitis and inflammation of the eye. Schoolboys, I may remark by the
way, are the worst window offenders, owing to their diabolical practice
of looking out of window in a tunnel--and, of course, _nothing_ ever
happens to them. What's the use of expostulating after the compartment
is full of yellow, choking vapour. These boys should be leashed together
like dogs and conveyed in the luggage-van.

The window is down. "W-h-oop," coughs an elderly man. "Do you mind, sir,
that window being closed?" Polite mendacity and inward bitterness on my
part towards the individual who has converted the compartment into an
oven.

But there are worse companions even than these, of whom I must speak
another time.

II.

I have known people thoughtlessly speak well of the luncheon-basket. In
my opinion, the luncheon-basket arouses the worst passions of human
nature, and is a direct incentive to deeds of violence. To say this is
to cast an aspersion upon the refreshment contractor, who is evidently a
man of touchingly simple faith and high imagination. Simple faith
assuredly, for does he not provide on the principle that our insides are
hardy and vigorous and unspoilt by the art of cooking? High imagination
most certainly, otherwise he would never call that red fluid by the name
of claret.

No, it is to the social rather than to the gastronomic influence of the
luncheon-basket that I wish to advert.

Once I procured a luncheon-basket and with it came the demon of
discontent and suspicion, converting three neutral people into deadly
enemies.

One was a pale young man who had been scowling over Browning and making
frantic notes on the margin of the book. Personally, I don't think it
quite decent for pale young men to improve their minds in a public
conveyance--but at any rate he had seemed harmless. Now he raised his
eyes and viewed me with undisguised contempt. "Wretched glutton," he
said in effect, and when accidentally I burned my mouth with mustard
(which a sudden swerve had sent meandering in a yellow stream across the
chicken and ham), he gave a sneering, callous smile, which reminded me
that a man may smile and smile and be a--railway companion.

I verily believe that youth to be capable of any crime, even Extension
lecturing.

Then there was a young lady reading a sixpenny Braddon, who viewed me as
if I were some monster; when I shut my eyes and gulped off
some--er--claret, she brought biscuits and lemonade from a small bag and
refreshed herself with ostentatious simplicity, as if to say, "Look upon
_this_ picture and on the wine-bibbing epicurean in the corner." An old
lady with her was more amply provided for (old ladies usually take more
care of their insides than anyone else in creation), but although she
munched sandwiches and washed them down with sherry (probably sweet,
ugh!) luxuriously, she looked with pious horror at my plates and dishes
spread out. I _might_ have said, "Madam, I eat frankly and openly; my
resources may be viewed by all. Your secret and delusive bags have
limitless resources that you are ashamed to show."

I didn't say so; but the restraint placed on myself quite spoilt the
lunch. No more baskets.

VOCES POPULI

ON THE PLATFORM

_A Lady of Family._ Oh, yes, I do travel third-class sometimes, my dear.
I consider it a duty to try to know something of the lower orders.

  [_Looks out for an empty third-class compartment._

EN ROUTE

_The seats are now all occupied: the Lady of Family is in one corner,
next to a Chatty Woman with a basket, and opposite to an
Eccentric-looking Man with a flighty manner._

_The Eccentric Man (to the Lady of Family)._ Sorry to disturb you, mum,
but you're a-setting on one o' my 'am sandwiches.

_The L. of F._???!!!

_The E. M. (considerately)._ Don't trouble yourself, mum, it's of no
intrinsic value. I on'y put it there to keep my seat.

_The Chatty W. (to the L. of F.)._ I think I've seen you about
Shinglebeach, 'ave I not?

_The L. of F._ It is very possible. I have been staying with some
friends in the neighbourhood.

_The C. W._ It's a nice cheerful place is Shinglebeach; but
(_confidentially_) don't you think it's a very sing'ler thing that in a
place like that--a fash'nable place, too--there shouldn't be a single
'am an' beef shop?

_The L. of F. (making a desperate effort to throw herself into the
question)._ What a very extraordinary thing, to be sure! Dear, _dear_
me! No ham and beef shop!

_The C. W._ It's so indeed, mum; and what's more, as I dare say you've
noticed for yourself, if you 'appen to want a snack o' fried fish ever
so, there isn't a place you could go to--leastways, at a moment's
notice. Now, 'ow do you explain such a thing as that?

_The L. of F. (faintly)._ I'm afraid I can't suggest any explanation.

_A Sententious Man._ Fried fish is very sustaining.

  [_Relapses into silence for the remainder of journey._

_The Eccentric Man._ Talking of sustaining, I remember, when we was
kids, my father ud bring us home two pennorth o' ches'nuts, and we 'ad
'em boiled, and they'd last us days. (_Sentimentally._) He was a kind
man, my father (_to the L. of F., who bows constrainedly_), though you
wouldn't ha' thought it, to look at him. I don't say, mind yer, that he
wasn't fond of his bit o' booze--(_the L. of F. looks out of
window_)--like the best of us. I'm goin' up to prove his will now, I
am--if you don't believe me, 'ere's the probate. (_Hands that document
round for inspection._) That's all reg'lar enough, I 'ope. (_To the L.
of F._) Don't give it back before you've done with it--I'm in no 'urry,
and there's good reading in it. (_Points out certain favourite passages
with a very dirty forefinger._) Begin there--_that's_ my name.

  [_The L. of F. peruses the will with as great a show of interest as she
  can bring herself to assume._

_The Eccentric Man._ D'ye see that big 'andsome building over there?
That's the County Lunatic Asylum--where my poor wife is shut up. I went
to see her last week, I did. (_Relates his visit in detail to the L. of
F., who listens unwillingly._) It's wonderful how many of our family
have been in that asylum from first to last. I 'ad a aunt who died
cracky; and my old mother, she's very peculiar at times. There's days
when I feel as if I was a little orf my own 'ed, so if I say anything at
all out of the way, you'll know what it is.

  [_L. of F. changes carriages at the next station. In the second carriage
are two Men of seafaring appearance, and a young Man who is parting from
his Fiancée as the L. of F. takes her seat._

_The Fiancé._ Excuse me one moment, ma'am.

(_Leans across the L. of F. and out of the window._)

Well, goodbye, my girl; take care of yourself.

_The Fiancée (with a hysterical giggle)._ Oh, I'll take care o' _my_
self.

  [_Looks at the roof of the carriage._

_He (with meaning)._ No more pickled onions, eh?

_She._ What a one you are to remember things! (_After a pause._) Give my
love to Joe.

_He._ All right. Well, Jenny, just one, for the last (_they embrace
loudly, after which the F. resumes his seat with an expression of
mingled sentiment and complacency_). Oh, (_to L. of F._) if you don't
mind my stepping across you again, mum. Jenny, if you see Dick between
this and Friday, just tell him as----

  [_Prolonged whispers; sounds of renewed kisses;_

_Final parting as train starts with a jerk which throws the Fiancé upon
the L. of F.'s lap. After the train is started a gleam of peculiar
significance is observable in the eyes of one of the Seafaring Men, who
is reclining in an easy attitude on the seat. His companion responds
with a grin of intelligence, and produces a large black bottle from the
rack. They drink, and hand the bottle to the Fiancé._

_The F._ Thankee I don't mind if I do. Here's wishing you----

  [_Remainder of sentiment drowned in sound of glug-glug-glug; is about to
  hand back bottle when the first Seafarer intimates that he is to pass it
  on. The L. of F. recoils in horror._

_Both Seafarers (reassuringly)._ It's _wine_, mum!

humanity has its drawbacks._

THE PORTER'S SLAM

[A meeting at Manchester raised a protest against the nuisance caused by
the needlessly loud "slamming" of railway carriage doors.]

  The porter has a patent "slam,"
    Which smites one like a blow,
  And everywhere that porter comes
    That "slam" is sure to go.
  It strikes upon the tym-pa-num
    Like shock of dynamite;
  By day it nearly makes you dumb--
    It deafens you at night.
  When startled by the patent "slam"
    The pious "pas-sen-jare,"
  Says something else that ends in "am"
    (Or he has patience rare).
  Not only does it cause a shock,
    But--Manchester remarks--
  "Depreciates the rolling stock,"
    Well, that is rather larks!
  _That's_ not the point. The porter's slam
    Conduces to insanity,
  And, though as mild as Mary's lamb,
    Drives men to loud profanity.
  If Manchester the "slam" can stay
    By raising of a stir,
  All railway-travellers will say,
    "Bully for Man-ches-ter!"

A raylway statyon. Showynge ye travellers refreshynge themselves.]

MR. PIPS HIS DIARY

_Tuesday, July 31, 1849._--Prevailed upon by my wife to carry her to
Bath, as she said, to go see her aunt Dorothy, but I know she looked
more to the pleasure of her trip than any thing else; nevertheless I do
think it necessary policy to keep in with her aunt, who is an old maid
and hath a pretty fortune; and to see what court and attention I pay her
though I do not care 2_d._ about her! But am mightily troubled to know
whether she hath sunk her money in an annuity, which makes me somewhat
uneasy at the charge of our journey, for what with fare, cab-hire, and
vails to Dorothy's servants for their good word, it did cost me
altogether _£_6 2_s._ 6_d._ To the Great Western station in a cab, by
reason of our luggage; for my wife must needs take so many trunks and
bandboxes, as is always the way with women: or else we might have gone
there for 2_s._ 6_d._ less in an omnibus. Did take our places in the
first class notwithstanding the expense, preferring both the seats and
the company; and also because if any necks or limbs are broken I note it
is generally in the second and third classes. So we settled, and the
carriage-doors slammed to, and the bell rung, the train with a whistle
off like a shot, and in the carriage with me and my wife a mighty pretty
lady, a Frenchwoman, and I did begin to talk French with her, which my
wife do not well understand, and by and by did find the air too much for
her where she was sitting, and would come and take her seat between us,
I know, on purpose. So fell a reading the _Times_, till one got in at
Hanwell, who seemed to be a physician, and mighty pretty discourse with
him touching the manner of treating madmen and lunatics, which is now by
gentle management, and is a great improvement on the old plan of chains
and the whip. Also of the foulness of London for want of fit drainage,
and how it do breed cholera and typhus, as sure as rotten cheese do
mites, and of the horrid folly of making a great gutter of the river. So
to Swindon station, where the train do stop ten minutes for refreshment,
and there my wife hungry, and I too with a good appetite,
notwithstanding the discourse about London filth. So we out, and to the
refreshment-room with a crowd of passengers, all pushing, and jostling,
and trampling on each others' toes, striving which should get served
first. With much ado got a basin of soup for my wife, and for myself a
veal and ham pie, and to see me looking at my watch and taking a
mouthful by turns; and how I did gulp a glass of Guinness his stout!
Before we had half finished, the guard rang the bell, and my wife with a
start, did spill her soup over her dress, and was obliged to leave half
of it; and to think how ridiculous I looked, scampering back to the
train with my meat-pie in my mouth! To run hurry-skurry at the sound of
a bell, do seem only fit for a gang of workmen; and the bustle of
railways do destroy all the dignity of travelling; but the world
altogether is less grand, and do go faster than formerly. Off again, and
to the end of our journey, troubled at the soup on my wife's dress, but
thankful I had got my change, and not left it behind me at the Swindon
station.

THE TYMPANUM

(_A Remonstrance at a Railway Station_)

  The tympanum! The tympanum!
  Oh! who will save the aural drum
  By softening to some gentler squeak
  The whistle's shrill _staccato_ shriek?
  Oh! Engine-driver, did you know
  How your blast smites one like a blow,
  An inward shock, a racking strain,
  A knife-like thrust of poignant pain,
  Whilst groping through the tunnel murk
  You would not with that fiendish jerk
  Let out that _sudden_ blast of steam
  Whose screaming almost makes _us_ scream
  Thy whistle weird perchance may be
  A sad and sore necessity,
  But cannot Law and sense combine
  To--well, in short to draw the line?--
  Across the open let it shrill
  From moor to moor, from hill to hill,
  But in the tunnel's crypt-like gloom,
  The station's cramped reverberant room,
  A gentler, _graduated_ blast!
  _Do_ let it loose, whilst dashing past,
  So shall it spare us many a pang;
  That dread explosive bursting "bang"
  Which nearly splits the aural drum,
  The poor long-suffering tympanum!

[Illustration: THE OLD HALL]

(_A Story of Delusive Aspirations_)

1. Jones was a tuft-hunter. One day, in a train, he encountered an
elderly gentleman who aroused great interest in his bosom. "Porter,"
said that elderly gentleman, "'ave you seen my old hall?" "Got an old
hall!" murmured Jones to himself. "Rich man--probably duke! Should like
to cultivate him!"

2. The stranger was affable. "Did you ever 'ave an old hall?" he said.
"Why--er--n-no," said Jones. "Very convenient thing to 'ave," said the
stranger. "I've got all manner o' things in my old hall." "Ah--armour,
and ancestors, and tapestry, and secret doors, no doubt," thought Jones
to himself.

3. "You must see my old hall," said the stranger. "I'll show you all the
ins and outs of it. I can put you up----" "Really very good of you!"
exclaimed Jones. "Shall be delighted to accept----" "Put you up to no
hend of wrinkles about old halls," continued the stranger.

4. They alighted at the terminus. "There--there's my old hall! Hain't it
a beauty?" said the stranger. Jones sank slowly to the earth, without a
groan. That ungrammatical stranger's vaunted possession was a hold-all.

RULES FOR THE RAIL

A REMINISCENCE OF THE BAD OLD DAYS

The President of the Board of Trade having sent a circular to the
railway companies with reference to making provisions for the prevention
of accidents and the enforcement of punctuality, especially in
connection with the running of excursion trains at this period of the
year, the following regulations will probably come under consideration.

1. In future one line will be kept (when feasible) for up trains, whilst
the other is reserved for the use of down-trains. This rule will not
apply to luggage and mineral trains, and trains inaccurately shunted on
to lines on which they (the trains) have no right to travel.

2. Station-masters should never permit a train to start more than forty
minutes late, except when very busy with the company's accounts.

3. As complaints have been made that signalmen are overworked, these
officers in future will occupy their boxes during the morning only.
During the rest of the day the boxes will be closed. That the public may
suffer no inconvenience by this arrangement, the trains will continue
running by day and by night as heretofore.

4. A pointsman will be expected to notice all signals and to obey them.
He will be required, before leaving his post (when on duty), to order
one of his children to look after the points during his absence. The
child he selects for this office should be at least three years old.

5. The driver and stoker in charge of an engine should never sleep at
the same time unless they have taken proper precautions beforehand to
prevent an excessive consumption of the company's fuel.

6. When a luggage train is loading or unloading beside the platform of a
station, it will be desirable to recollect the time at which an express
is due, as unnecessary collisions cause much damage to the rolling
stock, and not unfrequently grave inconvenience to first-class
passengers.

7. The _débris_ of a train should be removed from the rails before an
express is permitted to enter the tunnel in which an accident has taken
place. As non-compliance with this rule is likely to cause much delay to
the traffic, it should be obeyed when feasible.

8. As guards of excursion trains have been proved to be useless, their
places will in future be filled by surgeons. Passengers are particularly
requested to give no fees to the surgeons accompanying these trains, as
the salaries of these officials will be provided for in the prices
charged to the public for excursion tickets.

9. In future, contracts from surgeons and chemists will be accepted on
the same terms as those already received from refreshment caterers.

10. The public having frequently experienced inconvenience in having to
leave the station when requiring medical attention, in future the
waiting-rooms of the third-class passengers will be converted into
surgeries for first-class passengers. As these saloons will be fitted
with all the latest inventions in surgical instruments, a small extra
charge will be made to passengers using them.

11. The directors (in conclusion) fully recognising the responsibility
conferred upon them by the shareholders, if not by the public, will
expel from their body in future (as a person evidently of unsound mind)
any director convicted of travelling by any railway.

"Gracious heavens! No, Rogers! not for the world! The third-class

BLACKFRIARS TO SLOANE SQUARE

  The man who got in at Blackfriars
  Was smoking the foulest of briars,
    But it went out all right--
    Could I give him a light?--
  Hadn't got one--well, all men are liars.

  I've frequently noticed the Temple
  Is a place there are not enough rhymes to;
    And that's why I've made
    This verse somewhat blank,
  And rather disregarded the metre.

  How _do_ you pronounce Charing Cross?
  It's a point where I'm quite at a loss.
    Some people, of course,
    Would rhyme it with "horse,"
  But I always rhyme it with "hoss."

  A woman at Westminster Bridge
  Had got just a speck on the ridge
    Of her Romanesque nose.
    "It's a black, I suppose,"
  She observed. Then it flew--'twas a midge.

  One man from the Park of St. James,
  Had really the loftiest aims;
    In the hat-rack he sat,
    Used my hair as a mat,
  And when I demurred called me names.

  I bought from the stall at Victoria
  A horrible sixpenny story, a
    Book of a kind
    It pained me to find
  For sale at our English emporia.

  I found when I got to Sloane Square
  That my ticket was gone; my despair
    Was awful to see,
    Till at last to my glee
  I looked in my hat--it was there!

SOMEBODY'S LUGGAGE

If you see half-a-dozen new patent leather covered basket-trunks with a
name written upon all of them, in staring white characters, accompanied
by a gigantic portmanteau and three hat-boxes, you may know that the
Honourable Lionel and Rowena Silverspoon have started on their
wedding-tour.

If you see a weather-beaten portmanteau, accompanied by a neat little
trunk and a pretty little birdcage, you may know that Edwin and Angelina
Dovecot are going to Ventnor for the honeymoon.

If you see a big carpet-bag, accompanied by a large white umbrella and a
tin colour-box, you may know that Daub, A. R. A., is going to Brittany in
search of subjects.

If you see an overcrowded portmanteau, accompanied by a double-locked
despatch-box, you may know that urgent private affairs have induced
Captain Bubble (Promoter of Public Companies) to leave the City
hurriedly for Spain.

If you see a small bundle, accompanied by a pair of handcuffs, you may
know that urgent public affairs have induced Sergeant Smart (of the
Detective Police) to follow the same _route_ taken by Captain Bubble _en
voyage_ for Spain.

If you see twenty-four patent reversible extra waterproof holdalls, with
all the latest improvements, painted blue, green, yellow, and red, and
covered with hotel labels, accompanied by thirty-seven deal packing
cases, you may know that Colonel Jerusalem R. X. E. Squash, U.S.A., and
family are engaged in "doing" Europe.

If you see fifteen trunks, all more or less damaged, accompanied by an
old portmanteau and a double perambulator, you may know that Mr. and
Mrs. Paterfamilias and children are going to Herne Bay for a month.

If you see, in conclusion, a neat knapsack and a spiked walking-stick,
you may know that _Mr. Punch_ is off to Switzerland to enjoy himself.

    Lost it this morning.
  No, I have not a card,
  Nor can I pay you, guard--

  It was all the porter's fault, not mine,
    But his mind is narrow, his brain is bleak,
  His slowness and red tape combine
    To make him take about a week
    To label my bag--and he dared to speak,

THE ROUGH'S RAILWAY GUIDE

[Illustration]

The ready rough may always regard a third-class carriage, or indeed, any
carriage he can make his way into with or without a ticket, on the
Underground Railway as a sort of travelling Alsatia, where brutal
blackguardism finds "sanctuary."

The one duty of a guard--as of a watch--is to "keep time." He is not
expected to keep anything else, except tips. For instance he is not
bound to keep his temper, or to keep on the look out for roughs.

No one has a legal right to get into a carriage which is full, but then
a third-class carriage never is full so long as one more brawny brute
can violently force his way into it.

When bent upon enjoying the exceptional privileges and immunities
reserved for blackguardism by the Underground Gallios, it is only
necessary for a few hulking ruffians, big of course, and half drunk by
preference, to thrust themselves violently in some compartment
containing no less than twice its legal complement. In doing this they
will, of course, rudely trample the toes of weak women, and insolently
dislodge the hats of inoffensive men; thus paving the way pleasantly for
future operations.

Having squeezed themselves in somehow, they can then further indulge in
the lesser amenities of travel by puffing rank tobacco smoke in the
faces of their fellow-passengers, expectorating at large with not too
nice a reference to direction, and indulging in howling, chaff, and
horse-play of the most offensive character.

The addition of blasphemy, especially if there should be women and
children present, may probably provoke a mild remonstrance from some
one, and then the rough's opportunity has arrived at last.

To particularise the rough's rules for dealing with such an objector and
his sympathisers--if any--would be as tedious as superfluous; but the
combined arts of the low pugilist, the intoxicated wife-beater, and the
Lancashire "purler," may be called into play, with much enjoyment and
perfect safety, until the object of his wrath is beaten into
unconsciousness or kicked into convulsions. On reaching a station, the
frightened passengers may perhaps dare to appeal to the guard! That
autocratic official will of course, with much angry hustling and
holloaing, declare that _he_ can't stop to interfere, _his_ business
being, not to stay actual violence or prevent possible homicide, but to
"keep time," and the ruffianly scoundrels go off shouting and singing
"_Rule Britannia_" and telling their pals "what a bloomin' lark they've
had in the Hunderground."

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
