ur the one with the huge moon face

 

um it’s a steamed bun face


excuse u


and I'm not referring to UR face

im disappointed in u, chenchen

 

then what else r u good enough at to make that kind of money?

 

oh u think I'm good in bed

and i thought u were chinese

 

u stupid?


im korean

 

but “xiumin”

 

im gonna scream


that’s my stage name, u dumb fuck

 

stage name?


for what?


sex?

kinda


since i know japanese and korean


i thought a chinese sounding name would be sexy

 

and indeed it is

 

oh my, u flatter me


wait


u go by chen sometimes


but ur jongdae…

 

how long have we known each other for?


why is it only now that we notice each others’ names

 

way to avoid the question

yes daddy

 

jfc, minseok

 

but name why

Chapter End Notes
forgive me, for i have sinned
but hey, i got the whole CBX in here feat. Luhan ;)
did anyone catch my "Girl Problems" reference??? Does anyone listen to CBX's songs other than the MVs??? "ur my number one" is my direct reference to the lyric "'cause you are my number one" that leads into the chorus. Their "Girls" album is LIT. 
cries cuz i love CBX more than i love myself.


this is #healthy
Chapter Summary
darn hunhan ruining everything :< JK JK just read :3

xiumin is my 2nd bias (chanbaek is my #1 for now, just saying), so dont get me wrong with the way im creating his character. i love xiumin soooooo much and i find him real fun irl. 

        See the end of the chapter for more notes





minseok
 
yes?
 
i was out with kris today

and he said some strange things
 
and?
 
like um

he said that u
 
oh shit
 
uhhh

that u were texting suho and denied dating me

and ofc suho would tell kris

they’re practically married
 
i didn't know u were close with kris
 
we’ve been close for years

but that’s beyond the point

why’d u deny it?

do u not wanna date me?

r u ashamed or smth?
 
well

i cant text this

pick up so i can talk
 
ok

dude u hung up so fast

but i got it

kinda

why don't u want the others to know tho?

i understand that they might judge or whatever

but i feel like all ur friends r gay for each other
 
it’s not that

it’s just

i dont want them trying to influence u or anything

like tell u things that might make u misunderstand

like
 
things about luhan?
 
yeah.

that.

they still believe im “with” lu

but BELIEVE ME im not

we’re just friends

and i haven't seen him in months

not since he moved back to china
 
so rather than saying ur with me now

u just deny everything?

why not just tell them?

then they’ll stop mentioning luhan
 
hah.

if only.

they’ll probs turn it around and say ur a rebound

that i cant get over the break up

but

we

weren’t

romantically

involved

in the first place

just
 
fwb?
 
EXACTLY

u get me

♡
 
♡
 
don't misunderstand anything if i tell the guys

idk why but i fear sehun the most

he always eyed luhan when we were a thing

he might try to ruin us
 
or he could take luhan out of ur hair
 
oh good point

this is why i love u

i can freely talk about these things

and u can help me

this is #healthy
 
unlike ur eating habits

wait

wait

whoa

whoa

wait

what

just

the fuck

omg

minnie

did u just say u love me?

idk

u have kinks
 
just cuz my sex name is chinese doesn't mean im kinky
 
dude

u ate ramyun off me the other night
 
ok that was a one time thing

i wanted to combine the 2 things i love most

ramyun and u
 
why do i feel like that’s the ranked order?

1. ramyun, 2. me
 
idk
 
if u had to give up one of us (me or ramyun)

what would u choose
 
that’s really hard to say

ramyun is my staple food
 
THAT shouldn't be either

i love u
 
cuz there’s always naengmyeon

or soba

or udon

or spaghetti

i could drown that in hot water

dont worry babe

i wouldn't die without ramyun

there r replacements for it

not for u tho

chinese inspiration
Chapter Notes
tbh when i first saw exo, i thought xiumin was part of the maknae line and chinese. then upon closer inspection, i realized i was totally off.
ive been looking at so many pics of xiumin and chen (separately, but still). i sorta cant believe that chen was once my least favorite member of exo...i dont have a least favorite anymore. now that i love them all...but still. strange.he's so cute ugh. they're all so cute. im laying in a puddle of my emotions. why do i love them more than my own friends???this isnt healthy LOL
sorry for this mess of a chapter ;)

        See the end of the chapter for more notes





so i told junmyeon

 

?


what’d u tell him?


about us?

 

that im gay

lemme finish, u impatient marshmallow

 

why am i a marshmallow

it’s a secret

 

…ok

 

so i told him i was gay


and he laughed


and teared up


and i got scared


like


“should i take him in?”


“where’s the closet asylum?”


thoughts went through my head

 

um

 

and then he got his phone out


and called yifan

 

ofc

 

he told yifan to tell u


as if i don't talk to u already


so if u get a message from yifan


it’s probs about my sexual orientation


but idk why they'd tell u first

 

LOL OMG


HAHAHAHAH OFC THEY’D DO THAT


i just got texts from kris

 

ooh? what’d he say?

 

“go snatch him”


“it’s sexy time”


“fuck him up”


“i believe in u”


“hwaiting~ 
♡
”


exactly what he said

 

idk if i should be weirded out by that

 

they all know

 

know what?

 

that ive wanted u


since the beginning


first time i saw u, i was with kris


and accidentally said some stuff out loud


thought i was thinking it


nope


loud and clear for yifan’s ears

 

OMG

 

ever since then he’d make fun of me


but kinda stopped when luhan and u became


fwb

 

forget lu


what’d u say to kris tho


(
◕◡◕✿
)

 

i dont remember

 

yes u do


i know u know


…

idk what i said but ik i first saw u


u were taking a selca with 


with suho maybe


kris noticed me blushing


like i never blush

 

yah

LOL

 

regardless…


i might've said like


“he’d look better with me”


and


“how the fuck is someone so fucking adorable fuck me”


or something

 

AHAHAHAHA


SO MANY FUCKS


ALL FOR ME


so u got to know me cuz u wanted to take selcas with me?

and i lost my chance

 

eh


so-so


i never really dated luhan


i told u


chinese inspiration

Chapter End Notes
this is the selca chen was referring to https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/3f/6c/b6/3f6cb68344979768f0e964611b591b0c.jpg
so originally, i was gonna make it like a "god i wonder how he shouts in bed" and have the convo lean towards sexual intention, but then ive been watching so many xiumin videos and im not feeling good, so i totally changed the ending to make it all fluffy and warm.tbh what made me change my mind was xiumin's "marshmallow~" thing and then him calling chen his wife and just them together taking selcas and being so couple-like. ive seen those clips before, but watching them again made me feel the NEED to change the direction from "let's see what makes me scream" to cute fluffy romance that makes me wanna puke. HEHE


urso?
Chapter Summary
get ready for this one
Chapter Notes
how do i choose these titles? i just read and pick my favorite line. btw urso is a brand for cholesterol medicine and it also means bear. read and u'll find out how it fits the story. LOLi look at chen's selcas for inspiration and i listen to ka-ching when im having bad days. *instant good mood*

        See the end of the chapter for more notes





minnie
 
yes, chennie?
 
lol

so i was just at the store getting some extra stuff for the house

and u wouldn't believe what happened
 
wut
 
the cashier was a guy around my age maybe

idk im guessing

he looked young tho

and cute

ur cuter tho

but guess what his name was
 
luhan?
 
baekhyun.

his name is byun baekhyun
 
I JUST SCREAMED

HAHAHAHA

MY BABY IS REAL

BRING HIM HOME TO PAPA

I’LL BE HIS DADDY

U CAN BE THE MOMMY
 
that’s the thing

i invited him over

next week

he’s gonna bring his boyfriend, too
 
why is everyone we know gay?

even the strangers?
 
is sehun?
 
i have my suspicions

he’s still eyeing luhan

even tho luhan’s in china
 
wow

what great eyesight

id kill for those eyes
 
and id kill for yours

they’re so perfect and easy to get lost in

ahhh
 
[IMG attachment]
 
ew

keep ur eyes open or closed

or wink

just not half half
 
i thought u said ud kill for my eyes
 
stop trying to be ugly

it wont work no matter how hard u try
 
[IMG attachment]
 
id still fuck that
 
good to hear

how’s packing going?

need any help?
 
nah

im g

almost done

i didn't have much anyway

now the troublesome part is this house

i can get rid of its contents

but idk what to do about the house itself
 
hm?
 
sorry to be a pessimist

but what if we realize living together isn't the best thing for us

and then where do i go?

buy another place?

rent somewhere?

what stability do i have then?

meanwhile ud be fine cuz its ur place
 
its not pessimistic, it’s realistic

not all relationships last forever

but i’d like to try

and if it doesn't work out

ill buy u a place

u can screenshot and save that forever

hold it against me
 
even if we hate each other’s guts?
 
even then.

i will make sure u have a roof over ur head

that u can call ur own
 
but technically the roof i will be under would be urs
 
add an o
 
urso?
 
no, u bun


ours


and if u don't wanna feel like ur taking too much

then u can pay some rent

:D

ik u make bank with that japanese tutoring
 
they’re fun

the kids

even tho i yell at them for being stupid

u should meet them

and i take ur word for it

i have it screenshotted and saved in multiple places

labeled “IF THE BITCH STILL LIVES”
 
gee thanks
 
what if i really hate u

then id click that over something like

“my lovely chennie is whipped”
 
true
 
what part?
 
all of it

love u

mwah
 
whats that
 
me kissing u thru the phone
 
why not kiss me irl

im here
 
ooh yay!

delivery!
 
wtf babe

just open the damn door
 
coming~




Chapter End Notes
im considering possibly making this pt 1 of some weird shitty xiuchen/chanbaek/kaisoo/krisho or sulay/hunhan/taoris or taolay (whichever pairings i choose to use) chat series. cuz if xiuchen live together now...then they can just talk in person. and having a chat fic between the two would be a whole lot of chapter 6 with different convos. and i dont want this to have angst at all. no fights. just nice fluff and sex talk/jokes. but i also dont wanna contaminate the purity that is "i can take u places". if i get #inspired, i'll probably make subsequent fics with different (or the same) characters. knowing me, i'll probably make this a series. sorry to say.HOWEVER, i have small chapters/updates ready for this fic, but they're saved for later. like special occasions. *cough cough* christmas *cough cough* wow the air is really dry here. LOL. so if i mark this as complete, just know that come christmas, there will be additional chapters here. just like. little presents. coal or gold. who knows.writing these things makes me feel good. like i actually have a hobby other than lazing around and eating food.wow i wrote an essay in this note. (my notes are getting longer each chapter...)  oh well. BYE FOR NOW.


never set foot in our house again

ever-kinky-chinese-dirty-talking xiumin
Chapter Summary
minnie meets baby baek
Chapter Notes
yes, so sometime between the previous chapter and this chapter, xiuchen ate spaghetti off each other. this takes place after that sin occurred.so here's to reading this chapter while thinking about how chen licked the sauce off xiumin's body probably the night before. LOLOLOLOLyou're welcome for that visual（≧∇≦）

        See the end of the chapter for more notes





“Minnie, are you done making the spaghetti? They’re gonna be here any minute now,” Jongdae whined, arms snaking around his lover’s waist from behind. He rested his chin on the other’s shoulder and buried his face in the crevice of his neck.
 
“Stop it, that tickles,” Minseok couldn’t help but laugh at the younger’s attempts to distract him from preparing the four’s meal. Turning his head, he kissed his boyfriend’s fluffy-haired head before lightly kicking him in the shin.
 
“I can't finish with you being like this, wife. And wait. If you’re the wife, why aren’t you making dinner?”
 
Switching tactics, Jongdae began trailing kisses up and down the neck he claimed. “Because,” he said in between pecks, “We. Don’t. Follow. Stereotypes. Here. And I like watching you make food. It’s domestic,” he added with a smirk and patted Minseok twice on the belly before releasing the older from his embrace.
 
“Mhm, mhm. Whatever,” the older joked, returning his attention to the nearly-ready pasta in front of him. He hummed cheerfully as he finished preparing dinner and watched as Jongdae set the table. 
 
“You should roll your sleeves up like that more often,” the older said as he licked his lips, eyeing Chen’s forearms. “You’re looking more JongDaddy than anything with that get up.”
 
With a raise of an eyebrow and a mocking scoff, the younger responded, “Doesn’t this count as some sort of harassment? Don’t eye-fuck the innocent, little me.” He crossed his arms over his chest as some weak form of protection but knowingly showing off his forearms to the other.
 
“Hah. Innocent? Yeah, right. I don’t think innocent is the right word to describe you, Chennie. Last night was—“ 
 
He was cut off by a knock on the door.
 
“—Far from innocent,” he finished with a quick kiss to his boyfriend’s lips. “You should bring the guests in since my baby is familiar with you. Oh, I'm so excited to finally meet my child, you have no idea,” Xiumin practically sang as Jongdae headed for the door.
 
“Oh, I know,” he muttered playfully rolling his eyes with a ghost of a smile. 
 
Minseok came up from behind to greet the guests and his jaw dropped when he saw the giant standing at the threshold of his (and Jongdae’s) house. “Whoa. You’re huge. How much milk do you drink?”
 
The tall guy burst into laughter at the host’s question, leaning on his boyfriend for support. “Baek, I already love them. He’s hilarious.” Redirecting his attention and attempting to calm himself down, he offered his hand out to the oldest of the four. “I’m Chanyeol, Baekhyun’s boyfriend. Thanks for inviting us over.”
 
He flashed an adorable smile before shaking Chen’s hand as well. “I’m Minseok, but I also go by Xiumin, the true owner of this house, and this is my wife, Jongdae, who also goes by Chen,” Xiumin played, earning a rightfully deserved glare from Chen.
 
“Ignore him. This was originally my house and I’m his boyfriend. He’s weird.”
 
“He’s cute,” Baekhyun added. “I’m Baekhyun by the way. I heard from Jongdae that you were excited to meet me?” He turned the conversation towards Minseok.
 
“Yes, yes. Please, come in,” Xiumin led the guests to the dinner table. “I hope you’re fine with spaghetti. It’s the only dish I can make really well.”
 
Baekhyun smiled. “We’re good with anything. Thanks for making it.”
 
“Anything for my child,” Minseok mused. Jongdae shot him a concerned look and kicked him under the table.
 
Chanyeol glanced at his boyfriend, confusion shining at its best. Baekhyun cocked his head, also unsure of what the eldest meant.
 
“Well, if we’re all just gonna sit here in silence after that crap he spewed, we might as well eat,” Jongdae tried to break the awkward air that loomed over the four. 
 
Xiumin, out of no where, started cracking up and laughing until he started to wheeze. Once he could finally breathe again, he explained, “I eat a lot of ramyun—“
 
“More than a lot. Make that ‘too much’ ramyun,” Chen interjected and clarified.
 
“—Regardless, I eat ramyun religiously. And one day, drunk or not, who knows, I started getting fat and named my food baby Baekhyun. No reason. That name just came to mind. But then later on, I exercised off that belly and ‘Baekhyun,’” he used air quotes around the name, ”was no longer with us.”
 
“Then when he was moving in with me, I went to the store to buy supplies and whatnot. That’s where I met you, who coincidentally had the same name as his damn food baby. I am so sorry for how strange this is. I couldn’t help but invite you over because that would just make his fucking week,” Jongdae finished their story.
 
Baekhyun just sat there and stared at the two quietly for a moment before confessing, “To be honest, I have a houseplant named Chen, so that’s kinda why I wanted to meet up again.”
 
The four of them laughed loudly for minutes with Chanyeol repeatedly saying variations of, “I really really like these guys. Oh my god.”
 
“So wait, how old are you two?” Baekhyun asked after dinner.
 
“I’m 27 and he's turning 25 in about two months.”
 
“Whoa. You’re older? No offense, but you seem like you’d be the youngest out of all of us. You’re just so, uh, so—“
 
“You’re so fucking cute,” Chanyeol chimed in. “You’re fucking adorable. How do you even live?”
 
Minseok blushed slightly and asked, “What about you two? What’re your ages?”
 
“I’m 24 and he’s 25. Well, I’ll be 25 in November.”
 
“So you’re the baby here. With that height? What is the world becoming?” Xiumin jested and cursed the world. “How tall are you, by the way?”
 
“About 184 centimeters last time I checked.”
 
“Fuck. That’s more than 10 centimeters taller than me.” He snapped his gaze to Baekhyun. “Baek, where did you find such a guy? Where can I get one?”
 
“Hey! What kind of ho are you?” Jongdae lightly slapped Minseok's thigh.
 
“Even Luhan was taller than me, Chennie,” the eldest whined playfully.
 
“Luhan? Like Sehun’s Luhan?” Chanyeol quietly asked, question directed more towards himself than anyone. 
 
But Xiumin heard. “OH MY GOD. YOU KNOW THEM?” He nearly shrieked. “Hold on, I’m gonna invite them over now.” He pulled out his phone and sent a quick text. 
 

gucci



bring your boy toy



and like 80 million drinks



we going hard



chanyeol and baek are here



i think you know at least one of them

 

Chanyeol?



like musician giant, Chanyeol?

 
“Are you a musician?” Xiumin looked up from his phone to the tall one in question.
 
“Uh, yeah. I guess. I play a few instruments, sing, rap, dance, make music, do gigs. I guess I’m a musician?”
 
“Of course you are, you piece of humble shit,” Minseok couldn’t help but giggle at Baekhyun’s snide comment about the giant. That’s my baby, he thought.
 

yeah. musical genius, id say



he’s tall and hot



we talking about the same one?

 

definitely



if you’d tap that ass, then it’s the right one

 

why?

 

cuz we apparently have the same taste in ass

[FILE attached]


"Okay, so Sehun’s on his way with Luhan. And they’re bringing drinks.”
 
“I hope you guys don’t mind, but Kris and Suho are coming, too,” Chen announced warily.
 
Chanyeol stood up excitedly. “I’m game. The more the merrier. Man, I really like you guys.”
 
Baekhyun just smiled and took his boyfriend’s hand. “We drove here, so is it okay if we just stay the night as well? I hope that’s not asking too much,” he asked somewhat nervously.
 
“Oh, not at all. Minnie, clean up from dinner and I’ll go set up the guest rooms. I feel like everyone’s gonna end up crashing here tonight,” Jongdae said with a hint of regret. 
 
The night was just getting started.

The next chapter will have a little bit of an M rating cuz 6 of them will be partying together. and idk. there's some more than lowkey smut? like midkey smut, id say. lololol how cute. i don't wanna rate the entire fic M, so next chapter is M. i'll write that in the summary of the next one, as well as here. Just a fair warning. (or blessing, who knows). But omg why did I hint at Xiuhun???? The oldest and the maknae. I cry. It was so tempting. hehe ( *ˊᵕˋ) 


i'd be his baby any day
Chapter Notes
so i thought i'd have this party down in 2 chapters, but looks like i'm splitting this one in 2. so a total of 3 paragraph-style chapters for this get together.this one's not M rated, the next one will be tho.

        See the end of the chapter for more notes





Surprisingly, Suho and Yifan arrived before Sehun and Luhan did. So before any drinks were available for consumption, the six young men had to overcome any awkward formalities that came with self introductions and stories of how they all met. 
 
Which meant that Minseok had to once again explain his food baby Baekhyun to his other friends. Sober. 
 

get ur gucci ass over here



i need drinks



hurry



if u don't come within the next



11 minutes



i will out u to luhan



he will know about

ok ok ok



shut the fuck up, old man

door’s open



walk urself in



give ur hyung a drink



or should i say



ur “oppa”

 

shut up

 

i know ur kinks



now give me the strongest thing u have

 
Their texted ceased as Xiumin began taking shots, wanting to do away with any awkwardness the rest of the night might bring.
 
“Dude, this is like a gay bar,” he said with astonishment at his realization. “We got drinks and three sets of gays. It’s like a combo set.”
 
“What are we, fast food?” Luhan laughed.
 
The last couple to arrive came in luck because they already knew everyone in some way or another. No introductions necessary. They were the official ice breakers, bringing drinks for the rest to drown their nerves away with.
 
Already on his seventh shot of soju, Minseok felt the alcohol finally hit him. 
 
“Whoa, sweetie. You should really take it slow,” Jongdae worriedly advised as he rubbed circles on his lover’s back. “It’s hardly been an hour and you’re already on your second or third bottle. Babe, please. I don’t want you passing out tonight.”
 
In response, Minseok shifted his legs and laid them across Jongdae’s lap. “I’m gonna take a quick nap,” he murmured drowsily, resting his head on the other’s chest. 
 
“You guys are too cute, I’m gonna fucking die. Baek, if we ever split, I’m going after Minseok. He’s a fucking baby mochi despite his age,” Chanyeol gawked at the sleeping guy across from him. Chen glared in response, “mine” written all over his face.
 
“I don’t think mochi have babies?” Baekhyun slurred.
 
“But you’re Xiumin’s baby?”
 
“Oh yeah.” Baekhyun giggled. “That’s right. I am a mochi’s baby.”
 
Suho was the only near-sober one in the room. “You actually accept that you’re that dude’s child?”
 
“If I’m the product of ramyun and that really adorable yet sexy guy, then yes. I would gladly accept it.”
 
“Yo, me, too. I’d be his baby any day.”
 
“But Chanyeol, you’re too tall to be anyone’s child here,” Kris reasoned.
 
“LET’S PLAY A PUNISHMENT GAME!” Xiumin shouted as he rung to life, recharged after his much needed nap. The young man ran to the kitchen and returned with a box of pepero, whipped cream, marshmallows, and whatever else he could find. 
 
“Oh my god. Seriously? Minnie, you’re seriously gonna pass out at this rate. You know you suck at any type of game,” Chen tried.
 
“Well, you can suck my dick cuz we’re playing. Who’s in?”
 
All the boys except Chen were eager to participate, leading the opposed one to surrender and play along.
 
“Fine, fine. As long as we allow for black knighting.”
 
“Sure. The point is to get wasted, but if you really want to steal my alcohol, then go for it,” Xiumin taunted as he opened up the bag of large marshmallows. “This game is apparently called ‘Chubby Bunny’ in America and it tests how much dick you can fit in your mouth.”
 
“Oh my god. No, it doesn’t. What kind of bullshit are you making up?” Luhan asked in between  laughs. 
 
“Who cares, let’s play,” Baekhyun ordered to Chanyeol’’s surprise. He hadn’t seen his boyfriend that determined for such a game before. He kind of liked it.
 
“I’ll go first,” Chanyeol offered as he sacrificed himself.
 
“Okay, so the rules are that you have to say ‘Chubby Bunny’ as you add more marshmallows in your mouth, but that’s no fun. So instead, to motivate you all to win, we’re going to say our kinks. Remember, each additional marshmallow makes it more difficult to understand. So save your worst for last,” Minseok explained with a wink.
 
Jongdae shook his head slightly while chuckling. Chanyeol went pale in the face as he looked towards Baekhyun, who grinned coyly at his boyfriend. Suho, Kris, Sehun, and Luhan just watched with anticipation, ready to hear what the tall boy’s kinks were.
 
“Is this some sort of outing ritual?” Chanyeol asked before he began the game.
 
Each person in the room played, kinks ranging from animal-play to foreigner role-play to eating spaghetti off the other’s body. The latter brought a fierce blush to the cheeks of the four young men who ate spaghetti for dinner, knowing full well that the one who made it acted as a plate some time before. 
 
The games continued and the boys grew closer. And louder.
 
Any invisible boundaries were forgotten once the pepero game became their focused event. Kris was paired with Xiumin for one round, causing Chen to grow mildly jealous, watching the two inch closer together as they ate the pepero stick.
 
Determined to win, Minseok tilted his head as if he were about to seriously make out with the other, closing the distance between their lips. But before any mouth-to-mouth touching could even occur, Xiumin broke off his side of the pepero stick, leaving less than two centimeters of the treat.
 
Downing yet another drink, Chen shot up, screaming, “It’s my turn! I’m going with Minnie! Don’t try to change that!”
 
He grabbed a pepero stick and placed it between his teeth. Reaching for his boyfriend’s nape, he threaded his fingers through the other’s hair and swiftly pulled him in. Minseok eagerly allowed the younger to guide him, noting an unusual aggression in his boyfriend. As the distance between them shortened, Minseok naturally closed his eyes.
 
This set something deep within Jongdae ablaze as he soon forgot about the pepero in his mouth and smashed his lips against the other’s. 
 
The rest of the guys in the room seemed too drunk to care, or notice actually, so the two got up  and made their way to the bedroom, locking the door behind them.

“Shit. Why does my ass hurt as much as my head??? And what the heck is—WHOA WAIT WHAT’S THIS?” Minseok nearly shouted despite his killer headache in shock at the red marks wrapping around his wrists.
 
“Fuck you, what’d you do to me?” He looked over at Chen who was still passed out with an arm slung around the other’s bare abdominal. “You think you’re gonna get away with this? Huh?” Minseok teased as he reached for his boyfriend, intent to attack—with tickles.
 
“Ah, ah, no. No, stop! Stop it, Minnie. Why?” Waking up, he laughed as he squirmed under the other’s touch. 
 
“Why? Why? You’re asking me why when I’m the one with marked skin? What the fuck did we do?” He joked, still threatening the other lightly with his fingers. Suddenly he stopped. “Oh my god. Chenchen. Chenchen, the guests. Our friends. What happened to them?”
 
“Don’t sound like they died or anything. They’re probably in the other room and, or the living room still. Most likely the latter, though. Everyone was pretty messed up.”
 
“So you remember?”
 
“Remember what?”
 
Xiumin held up his hands to showcase the marks. “This! What is this?”
 
Jongdae let out a chuckle before toppling over onto the older. “Don’t worry.” kiss “You’ll remember,” kiss, “shortly.” kiss “It’s nothing bad,” kiss, “I promise you.” 
 
“Dude, if you do this to me now, I don’t think we’re leaving this bed for another hour or so.”
 
The younger rolled his eyes and got up, putting on some clothes before exiting the room.
 
Minseok was left to his own thoughts, his own demise. He looked at his wrists as he stood up, headache still raging, and headed for the bathroom.
 
Standing in front of the mirror was something he instantly regretted. Inspecting his body in the reflection, he saw, in addition to the marks encircling his wrists, he had long scratch marks down his back and suctioned bruises (read: hickeys) in places he never could’ve imagined.
 
“Was that really Chennie?” The older couldn’t help but wonder if he had drunkenly slept with Luhan again, or maybe even Sehun. Hell, he would even believe it if he had gotten these tell-tale signs from that giant, Chanyeol, who he met the previous night.
 
Anyone could’ve done this, just not Jongdae, Minseok thought. 
 
Then it hit him.
 
Pepero still in his mouth, he felt the invasion of Jongdae’s tongue, tasting both him and the snack. Hands eagerly explored one another as they made their way into the bedroom. 
 
“Mm, Jongd—“ Minseok barely managed to formulate some sort of words as his lover pushed him against the inside of their door, hitching him up on his hips. Fuck, since when was Chen this strong?
 
Minseok wrapped his arms around the other’s neck, as Jongdae tightened his grip around the older’s waist, each desperately wanting to eradicate the distance that separated them. With the younger’s finger’s sending chills up Xiumin’s spine, the older arched his back, deepening the kiss as his tongue insisted on making the other’s mouth its own.
 
Rolling his hips with each movement of the younger’s hands on his back, Minseok moved his lips away from the other’s and searched for more places to conquer. He took the younger’s earlobe in his teeth and sucked lightly, evoking a moan from deep within Jongdae. 
 
“I want you to fuck me like you’ve never before,” he whispered into the sensitive ear. 
 
The younger let out a low growl. “So you’re asking me to top for once?”
 
Still in his arms and pressed against the door, the older grinded against the other’s crotch. “Fuck. Me. Hard. Jongdae.” He said between his teeth, lips brushing over skin raw from the marks left by Minseok.
 
Jongdae would’ve sank to the ground had they not been leaning against the wall. His hands abandoned the older’s back and fingers wrapped around thighs, securing Minseok as they traveled to the bed. 
 
“I hope you know what you’re—mm—getting into when y—ah—you say that,” he mumbled between gasps and moans before throwing his boyfriend onto the bed. 
 
On all fours, Jongdae crawled up the bed to hover over the older, pressing a knee high between his thighs. Minseok twitched at the subtle touch and reached for his lover. 
 
“You want me like never before? Fuck, wish granted. Stay there.”
 
Minseok froze. Where the hell is he going? “Yessir,” he joked in attempt to distract himself from his neglected lower regions.
 
Less than thirty seconds later, Jongdae returned with some sort of ribbon. 
 
“What the fuck, Chennie?”
 
“Shut up,” he responded, tossing the item on the side while he once again toppled his boyfriend, straddle sitting on his lap. 
 
He reached down for the older’s shoulder to guide him to sit upright before connecting his lips to the other’s. 
 
“Babe, you’re so hard and I’m just getting started,” Jongdae chuckled, hand teasing the growing bulge beneath him. Xiumin’s hips jerked in response.
 
“Sorry. Can’t help it,” he breathed, words melting into the other’s mouth. He snaked his hands around Jongdae’s hips in hopes of speeding up the process but was cut off short when the younger grabbed hold of his wrists.
 
“What do you think you’re doing, you impatient fucking bun?”
 
Jongdae’s sudden assertiveness sent an electric shock throughout Minseok, who submitted to the younger, allowing him to do as he pleased. He trusted Chen. He trusted that the boy would not cause him any harm. He also trusted that Chen could bring them both the pleasure they desperately desired.
 
“Just a centimeter. Scoot forward. A centi—ah,” words were lost as Jongdae followed his one wish, body putting pressure on an area in much need of attention. Jongdae traced the other’s lip with his tongue before diving in. 
 
“You taste so fucking good,” he sucked on the bottom lip. “So. Fucking. Delicious,” he growled as he rolled his hips, grinding on the older’s still-growing erection, before teasing the exposed skin at the older’s waist.
 
Within seconds, shirts were off. Finally, Xiumin thought. But to his surprise, the rest remained on. 
 
Chen lowered their bodies onto the bed and grabbed both the older’s hands with one of his, the other hand reaching for the item he brought back not too long ago. He began tying. 
 
“Oh my fucking god, you are kinky,” Minseok gaped in disbelief. “I’ve been holding back, you psycho. Fucking yes. My god, I love you so fucking much.”
 
“I’ve always wanted to try this,” he replied as he took another piece of ribbon and blindfolded the older. “Is it okay?”
 
“Fuck, yes,” he groaned as the other started making his way down his torso with his mouth. Minseok’s breathing grew irregular with sharp inhalations as he felt his lover’s lips brush around his navel before a tongue dipped in. His abdominal tightened and flexed with each sensual stroke of the younger’s tongue. 
 
That goddamn tongue traveled lower until it rested at the top of his pants. How much he wanted to reach down and remove them drove the older boy mad as the younger teased him. 
 
“Please, Chennie. Just, please,” he whimpered much to the younger’s delight, who complied, taking off the restriction that bounded the older. 
 
Jongdae smirked at the sight and got up enough to separate his touch from his boyfriend, who jolted in confusion from the suddenness of being left alone. “J-Jongdae?” The blindfolded one asked weakly.
 
He then felt cushioned heat engulf his hard dick, causing him to buck his hips. “Sh-shit, oh man. M-more. Uhnn,” the older moaned, rolling his hips for more access to whatever he was inside of.
 
The younger hummed softly as he took his lover in the mouth, completely and as far as he could possibly hold him. As he licked and sucked, he removed himself with an audible pop, leaving the older a moaning mess. “C-come back. I need it. More. I need you, babe. No, ahh,” he whined. 
 
His breath hitched as something warm circled his base and wandered down to unearth and outline his tight entrance. He clenched at the direct touch. That damned tongue proceeded to tour away from the heat and up the older’s thigh as the younger lifted one, positioning his lover for what would come next.
 
He licked his lips and journeyed back to the entrance, leaving dozens of light bruises from his suctioned kisses in a line down the inner thigh. 
 
Xiumin sucked in a breath, erratic with each and every one of the younger’s touches. He felt his mind swirl from both the alcohol and the tongue that entered, hips jerking at the sudden intrusion. He could recognize a finger, and another, join the warm tongue, stretching and preparing him. 
 
Blindfolded and constricted, he used his body to help himself get closer to what he wanted, rocking and sinking onto the digits that filled him. 
 
Seemingly satisfied, Jongdae slowly came up, mouth trailing up the older’s thick cock, increasing in sensitivity. He slid one of Xiumin’s hands out from the tie and wrapped the slender fingers around his own member. As Minseok blindly stroked, the younger reached for the bottle of lube. Both the boys were at their limits, precum dripping down their veiny shafts. 
 
“Fuck condoms, I’m filling you up tonight,” he growled, removing the older’s hand and once again tying it up. He prepped himself and his lover with the lubricant and oriented himself at the entrance. Without a word, he plunged himself in to the hilt, the older, a sheath for his seductive weapon. 
 
A muffled yelp was sounded from Minseok. “Scream. Be loud. I wanna hear your voice,” the younger whispered hoarsely fully sunken into his lover. He pulled out quite a bit before sliding back in, earning himself a loud, uncensored moan from the other. “That’s it. Don’t worry. No one will hear you. It’s just you and me. I’ll take care of you,” he groaned in between thrusts.
 
“Sh-shit, ah. Nnn, Chennie, fuck. Fuck. Me. Fuck me, Jongda-daddy. Ha-harder. T-touch m-me,” the older attempted a grin and shouted as he rolled and met each thrust. 
 
With that, Jongdae got an idea and pulled out completely, leading Minseok to a moment of panic and worry over calling the other “daddy.” 
 
“Fuck, there’s no daddy kink here, I just—it came naturally, I—“ He was interrupted by a forceful pull at his shoulders, making him sit up despite how uncomfortable his ass was already.
 
His tied hands were brought over the younger’s head, trapping it between the older’s arms. Lips met in a passionate fury. Unbeknownst to him, Minseok’s hips were guided by the younger, being placed perfectly.
 
“Ride me,” Jongdae said as he slammed himself upward into his lover, who screamed out of pleasure in response. In their new position, they fucked long and hard. Enjoying the tight heat that engulfed and slid against his length, Chen found himself clawing at the other’s back, drawing him in closer with each thrust and movement on his shaft. 
 
Hands too weak to continue, Jongdae rested them on the older’s hips, guiding him once more as they both rode out the last of their pleasure, Minseok vibrating and erratically jerking his hips with the other still inside, full of both his lover and liquid.
 
They laid down in each other’s embrace, Chen carefully removing the binds and blindfold from his boyfriend. 
 
Out of breath and frail, Xiumin whispered, “Goddamn, I’m married to a fucking god. I love you so much, Chennie, you have no idea.” He reached up to brush some hair out of his lover’s eyes. His hand was caught immediately and his palm kissed.
 
“Not as much as I love you,” he giggled innocently, watching the older submit to a deep slumber. 
 
Fully aware of the events that occurred the previous night, Xiumin sat in painful disbelief. That was both amazing and terrible at the same time, he thought.
 

im never letting u drink again.

 

???

 

you fucking kinkmaster





Chapter End Notes
WHEN I WRITE SMUT, I WRITE A LOTbut wtf did i write...tbh i could've gone into more detail, but mid-way through writing a section of that chapter, i had to go to the doctor's for an appointment, so when i returned to finish it, i realized how freaking detailed i was making it.like we're talking graphic. gory. too much information about minnie's nether regions. it made ME feel uncomfortable when i came back to complete the chapter.so if it suddenly changed from "wao so many descriptions" to "that's a lot of vague verbs", that's because i felt bad for writing (probably E rated tbh) smut in a T+ chat fic.LMAO. i get carried away.but who cares, ya got ur wild kinky chen in a chapter.ALSO, if u want the full on smut, just wait a few days or weeks and i'll be uploading oneshots and random smuts for monsta x and exo fandoms. nonetheless, WE'RE BACK TO TEXTING NEXT CHAPTER~

it was years ago

like long ago

u know how they both r

they’re weird
 
mm?
 
i can feel ur passive aggression all the way in shanghai

dude calm

they just wanted to see who was the kinkiest

so one night

u get it

they tried things out

it was when minseok spoke chinese a lot
 
?
 
that’s when he got the name “xiumin”
 
that young gucci fuck gave him the name?
 
no no

well

kinda

they thought it up together

as a joke

but it stuck
 
why didn't he tell me tho
 
neither of them were telling anyone

i just happened to be living with sehun at the time

needed a place to stay while i was in korea

and i overheard their phone conversation the day after

pretty interesting shit, if u ask me
 
ur the only one who knows?
 
besides u now
 
they don't know u know?
 
nope

i doubt it
 
shit

so they cant know i know either
 
dude

it’s srsly in the past

the only thing id be worried about is if sehun goes after u
 
WHY??
 
cuz he and minseok have the same taste in guys
 
i didn't need to fucking know that
 
but r u srsly gonna be mad cuz ur boyfriend has a history?
 
…idk
 
just cuz u don't doesn't mean it justifies u being a bitch about it
 
wow.

just wow.
 
dont even think that he would cheat, either

as much as he can get around 

(over time, not all at once)

he is probably the most loyal person i know
 
um.

me.
 
ur just weird
 
gee thanks

lol
 
haha

but still

minseok is extremely loyal despite what he says

and his sexual behavior
 
it’s weird to think that such a cute guy

is such a monster

in bed
 
i agree

100%

creepy.

never trust a cute face
 
i trust him tho
 
oh do u?
 
yeah. i have to

if i wanna marry him

i need to trust him
 
so the proposal is still in action?
 
yeah. ofc

i fucking adore and love him

i cant leave him

and if i hurry tf up

then i can make him mine officially
 
bleh

^ i threw up cuz ur too innocent

so what r u gonna do about him and chanyeol?
 
i was mad at first

but now i realize that i kinda pushed him to it
 
what u mean?
 
im acting too busy for him cuz the secrecy of the proposal

dont judge just cuz it’s small

i hear ppl in america like keeping little cactus plants

im offended that ur being rude to chen

CHEN

Baekhyun was right. Minseok nearly threw a fit when he lost all hope of winning that day. 
 
“You should've fucking told me your friends were pro,” he quietly whined to himself, sending daggers from his sharp eyes to the younger. 
 
Jongdae pulled the grumpy one’s head into the crevice of his neck as he wrapped an arm around his boyfriend. “We can go bowling again with people who suck so you can win. Okay?”
 
He received a pouted look as the older lifted his chin to look at the boy. “Don’t treat me like a child.”
 
“But you are one. A big baby. That’s what you are.” He stroked the older’s soft, brown hair. “A cute, sexy, charming baby.”
 
The older nuzzled into the comfort of the other. He planted a light kiss on Jongdae’s neck. “I love you, you know that, right?”
 
The younger hummed in response, “And I do you.”
 
“Oh quit it, you guys are making me sick,” Junmyeon gagged from behind. “Can’t you wait till ur home or something? I’d rather not be reminded of our little get together from a while ago. I was the only one sober enough to hear those fucking screams, Min. Nasty.”
 
“You weren’t too bothered by it before. What the hell did Yifan do to make you this allergic to love?” Minseok asked. Jongdae tensed slightly.
 
“Long story short, we’re taking a break and he’s probably gonna see someone else in the mean time,” he muttered.
 
Xiumin gasped. “And you’re okay with this, why? You know what, never mind. Chennie, I’m not coming home tonight. In fact, I’m leaving right now. Suho, we’re going somewhere good,” the older instructed as he changed his shoes and dragged the other out of the building.
 
On their way out, Minseok blind with rage didn’t notice the stranger he was about to make collide with his friend. Oh shit, too late now, he thought as the two crashed into each other. Slyly, the eldest slipped away and watched from afar, hoping to take no blame for what just happened. 
 
Suho quickly searched for his friend before he met the stranger’s gaze. They sat on the ground where they had fallen for a moment, eyes locked. Minseok, curiosity burning, returned to the two. He watched.
 
“Oh, um sorry,” Junmyeon mumbled as he snapped back to reality. The other seemed to as well, shaking off the daze.
 
“Yeah, me too. I wasn’t watching where I was going. Didn’t think I’d run into anyone who looks as good as you.”
 
Minseok choked as he suppressed a laugh. Was this guy flirting? He did agree, nonetheless. Suho was pretty hot with his contrasting features: pale complexion, dark hair, and thick eyebrows above soft, deep eyes. Minseok was sure he was surrounded by attractive friends and couldn’t understand why. 
 

Why is everyone so fucking hot and I still look like a little boy? I’m the oldest. God, no respect.

 
The stranger held out his hand as he got up, offering it to Suho for assistance. To Xiumin’s relief, the boy took the hand and got up. “I’m Lay,” the stranger introduced as he continued to latch onto the other’s hand.
 
“Suho,” he breathed. Minseok had to restrain himself from falling with laughter right then and there. His friend was acting like a damsel in distress and he didn’t know what to do about it. Encourage or make fun of it?
 
“Did you just finish bowling?” Lay asked, eyes still unwavering from the other’s stare.
 
“Yeah, kinda.”
 
Kinda? What kind of a response is that, Junmyeon? Snatch that boy, take him home. If Kris can do it, so can you. Let’s go, Xiumin cheered internally, eyeing the two with great curiosity.
 
More words were exchanged by the two and to Xiumin’s delight, they left. Together. Forgetting about anyone else, including the older one who was standing just a few meters away.
 
Chen came up from behind scooping his lover into his arms. “Where’d Junmyeon go?”
 
“I don’t know. He just left with some guy we bumped into.”
 
“What’s he doing?”
 
“Gonna get Lay-ed,” Minseok joked, proud with his own pun that wouldn’t reach his boyfriend.
 
“Fuck.”
 
“Just let it happen. Don’t tell Yifan. They need to work this out on their own.”
 
“Didn’t you just set that up, though?”
 
“No, no. If only I had…That would’ve been a masterpiece. I just watched from the side. They forgot about me,” he feigned a cry as he snuggled into his boyfriend.
 
“I guess you have no reason to leave now, huh? Let’s go back. Kai and Kyungsoo were wondering where you went. I don’t wanna have a sore loser for a boyfriend, so let’s play some more. I’ll treat you to something nice tonight,” he sang.
 
“S’mores?”
 
“Why is that the only thing you can think of?”
 
“I don’t know. I just want marshmallows right now,” he replied innocently.
 
Jongdae kissed his cheek. “Mmmmkay. Will do. I’ll make you the best s’mores you’ve ever had, my love.”
 
The older giggled as they returned to the game. Chanyeol looked at the two in awe as Baekhyun muttered, “That’s so gross thinking they’re my ‘parents,’” using air quotes.
 
“You just ruined the moment,” his boyfriend nudged him in the side before grabbing a bowling ball and stepping up to the lane.

he’s mumbling stuff about u and suho

he’s going insane

he wont even come in bed

just walking around the room

staring at his phone
 
why me and suho tho
 
think about it

his parents r practically divorcing

and he’s hearing about his mom sleeping with some other guy
 
SUHO IS WHAT
 
u heard me
 
ಠ
_
ಥ

where did this all go wrong
 
when u eye-fucked that dude
 
but i didn't fuck him
 
what if junmyeon wants u back

even after he’s been with someone else
 
did i drive him to do it
 
i asked min

he says “come back home, dad”

“mom’s in bed with a snake”
 
-.-
 
a few days ago we went bowling

junmyeon was upset

i think he cried that day

then on their way out, he met lay
 
lay?

like the dancer?
 
r there other guys named lay?

minnie says yeah, he's a dancer
 
holy shit
 
why?

u know him?

JONGDAMMIT

U CANT SAY THINGS LIKE THAT

WHEN HE’S IN THE ROOM WITH ME

WHAT IF HE SEES????

Two thirty in the morning. Junmyeon thought he was hallucinating when he heard a banging on his front door.
 
Groggily, he answered. Before his eyes could even focus beneath the sleepiness that hazed over them, an all too familiar mouth pressed firmly against his. 
 
He smiled. “I missed you.”
 
“I love you. Don’t you fucking forget that.”
 
Yifan closed the door behind him and scooped up his lover, carrying him to the kitchen.
 
“What? Where are we going?” Junmyeon questioned against the other’s moving lips.
 
“We’re changing your bed before I even step foot in that bedroom, so we’ll make do over here,” he replied simply, propping the boy up on the counter.
 
He placed his hands firmly on the other’s hips as he nuzzled into the neck before him, tracing the jaw lightly with his nose. Junmyeon giggled, gripping the older’s forearms and brushing his thumbs over the protruding veins.
 
The younger wrapped his legs around the other, trapping him and bringing him closer. “I love you, too.”
 
Yifan leaned forward and removed the boy’s shirt in one swift motion. He laid the younger back, watching him tense as his skin made contact with the cold countertop.
 
Declaring his love with each caress, each kiss, Yifan took Junmyeon on the countertop, no sign of regret in his choice of location.
 
He loved the other. Nothing would change that.

flowers (pt.1)

Chapter Notes
it's so short. #rip

        See the end of the chapter for more notes





Dressed in a pink and gray suit, Minseok made his way to the mall. Upon his arrival, a small flower shop booth that was set up outside caught his attention.
 
He changed his route to meet Baekhyun and ventured over to the small make-shift shop. Flowers were a weakness for Minseok. They reminded him of Jongdae ever since Baekhyun mentioned his houseplant named Chen.
 
Maybe I should get something for our house? Minseok pondered as he lifted one of the plants. 
 
Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted a bouquet of small pink and blue flowers with wisps of white baby’s breath. Next to it was a slip of paper that read the meanings of all the flowers.
 
He picked up the sign, selecting which flower best described his love for Chen. He giggled softly as he found himself ridiculous, looking at flowers and determining which one matched with his feelings.
 
What the hell am I doing? he wondered as he took a photo of the small paper. In case he was to return later and the shop was still there. Maybe Chennie would like some. 
 
Moments later, he entered the mall and met up with his friend. 
 
“You fucking lying snake, Baek. You’re not even dressed that nicely and you tell me to come all fancied up? Now I stand out so much,” Xiumin laughed as he complained to the younger.
 
Baekhyun eyed him, “Why’d you go with pink, though? If you didn’t wanna stand out, then why didn’t you go with something more subtle and less gigolo-like?”
 
Minseok rolled his eyes before noticing his ringing phone. “Yes, my love?” he answered, recognizing the caller ID as his boyfriend’s, “you need something?”
 
“Uh, where are you right now?” the other asked.
 
“Mall. With Baekhyunnie. I’ll gladly ditch him to hang out with you, though,” he heard Baekhyun sigh from behind. “Why, what’s up?”
 
“I’m near the mall, actually. Go outside the main entrance. I’ll pick you up from there,” Jongdae directed. “Oh, and tell Baekhyun that I’m sorry for stealing you.” Minseok smiled at the muffled laughter from the other end.
 
“Will do, Chennie. I’ll meet you outside.”

For weeks, maybe even months, Jongdae had been dedicating so much time to plan his proposal. 
 
“Dude, there’s no way he’d say no. Are you stupid or what? He literally calls you his wife to everyone. He even introduced you as that the other day. You said so yourself. Why the fuck are you so hesitant about this whole thing?” Kris would berate over the phone after receiving his own scolding from Junmyeon who said that Minseok was worried about Jongdae’s recent lack of attention.
 
“You’re actually digging yourself deeper into a fucking hole. Probably your grave because this is obviously killing you. Does he need such a fancy, thought-out proposal? You’re spending more time with your plan than with your actual boyfriend.”
 
Jongdae sighed, “It needs to be perfect.”
 
“Um, no it doesn’t.”
 
“Do you even know Minseok? He’s perfect. A perfect person deserves a perfect proposal.”
 
“You’re a fucking idiot. He’s nowhere near perfect. No one’s perfect. Get your head out of the clouds and put a fucking ring on his fingers for fuck’s sake,” Kris huffed over the phone as he grew increasingly more annoyed at the naive other.
 
“Well too late now ‘cause it’s all pretty much planned out. Just a few more details to think over. I think I’m gonna do it this week. 
 
“You better fucking do it tomorrow.”
 
“Maybe,” Jongdae half-promised, unsure if his preparations were complete or not.

After what felt like hours of doing breathing exercises in hope of settling his nerves, Jongdae waited in his car for Minseok, eyes glued to the mall entrance. He sat there reciting and practicing what he had planned. 
 
Everything will be just fine. It will all work out. It will be perfect, he chanted internally as he watched for his lover to exit.
 
What he didn’t expect was his boyfriend looking so goddamn good in a fancy soft pink suit with gray accents. He swallowed, feeling his nerves spiking once again.
 

Oh shit, not again. Calm, Jongdae. Calm. You got this. Everything will be just fine. It will all work out. 

 
Pep-talk aside, Chen’s anxiety did not cease. As the elder approached, the younger found himself forgetting to breathe, fiddling with the small, delicate ring in his pocket. 
 
Noticing Minseok heading for the driver’s side, Jongdae rolled down his window. He chuckled as he gave the other a questioning look. 
 
“What are you doing? Get in,” he laughed.
 
Minseok gave him a chaste kiss on the lips and giggled. “Hold on, I have to go get something. It’ll take less than five minutes,” he promised as he leaned in for another peck before jogging off. 
 
Jongdae, appreciating the view, forgave the other for delaying his plans. He probably subconsciously was thanking his boyfriend for inadvertently and unknowingly giving the younger more time to mentally prepare himself.
 
As if he needed it.
 
Finally ready and confident enough to follow through with his perfected plan, Jongdae gave his attention to the figure rounding the car and entering through the passenger side. 
 
“See? Four minutes. Less than five,” he beamed. Jongdae melted at the sight of the other’s soft expression. He reached a hand over to the elder’s face and caressed his cheek. 
 
“I love you,” he mumbled.
 
“Of course you do, you dummy. I love you, too,” he giggled, pressing his lips against the inner side of the younger’s wrist. “So what’s the plan? Have anything fun in mind?”
 
Jongdae scratched his head before holding the back of his neck. He swallowed nervously again. “Uh, yeah. I kinda wanted to go somewhere,” he trailed off.
 
“Where? Hmm?” the elder pestered.
 
Jongdae gripped his boyfriend’s hand. “It’s a secret,” he grinned as the other dramatically pouted.
 
“Oh, by the way, what’d you go back in the mall for?”
 
Minseok smirked. “Secret,” he mocked.
 
The younger rolled his eyes, letting it slide because the other would not pry for his secret if he let this one be. “Mhm. Okay,” he hummed as he kissed Minseok’s hand. 
 
“What do you want for dinner tonight?”
 
“This early? You’re thinking of dinner before lunch?” he laughed. “You’re so cute. I’ll have anything. You gonna cook? Or do you want me to?”
 
“Take out?”
 
“Jjajjangmyeon?”
 
“With fried tofu and stir fry veggies maybe.”
 
“Got it. I’ll order when we get home.”
 
The two couldn’t help but smile over how domestic they’ve become over the months. Minseok tilted his head to the side as he glanced at his boyfriend, playing with his long fingers. 
 
“Lucky,” he whispered. “I’m so fucking lucky.”
 
“Huh? What’d you say?” the younger asked, catching the older’s stare for a brief moment before looking back to the road.
 
The elder leaned forward and kissed the younger’s sharp jaw, giggling lightly, breath tickling the other’s skin. 
 
They arrived at a place Minseok had never been to before. He took in his surroundings, noticing a small swing attached to the lowest hanging, thick branch of a tall, sturdy tree.
 
“This is my happy place,” Jongdae stated simply. “It’s where I spent most of my time as a child when I wasn’t in school. It’s not too far from our current house, so sometimes I would come here when I needed to think.”
 
Minseok watched the younger reminisce as he brushed the rope of the swing with his hand. 
 
The younger came from behind and placed his hand atop the other’s on the rope.
 
“I stopped coming here a little under a year ago when we started dating. I had less to think about, fewer things to be unhappy over,” he nuzzled into the crook of the elder’s neck and smiled against the skin. “I have nothing to be sad about, but I started coming here again recently.”
 
Minseok reached for the other’s free arm and wrapped it around his own waist. 
 
“I’ve had a lot to think about, a lot to plan.” He paused, taking a step back. Jongdae came to Minseok’s front and placed his hands on the elder’s shoulders, directing him to sit on the makeshift swing.
 
He moved to behind the swing and began pushing lightly. “Close your eyes. It makes the swing much more enjoyable,” he instructed as he stepped to the side to watch his boyfriend.
 
The swing ceased momentum and the elder kept his eyes shut. Jongdae stood before the other and placed a soft, loving kiss on the other’s forehead.
 
“This took me an entire month to figure out, you know,” he muttered, earning a confused look from the elder.
 
He took Minseok’s left hand in his and slid a small, rose gold band on the ring finger. “You’ve taken over my home, my heart, and now my special hideaway place. You've also become my home, my heart, and my safe place. 
 
“I’m happy where I am now and want to stay like this forever. You are my world, galaxy, universe. My everything. As sappy and cheesy as this may be, I love you too much to even care about making this subtle.
 
“Not much will change with marriage since we already live together and act like a married couple. But that doesn’t matter to me. I just want you to be mine forever,” he finally let himself gaze into the other’s eyes.
 
Minseok’s expression, soft and intense, brought butterflies to the younger’s stomach. He had never seen this look on the other’s face and could’ve sworn the elder’s eyes were glistening with warm, wet tears, threatening to escape.
 
“I’m already with you forever. You’re my best friend and I will never stop loving you. Let’s go back, I’m getting hungry,” he mused as he got up from the swing and started to the car, leaving Jongdae dazed and confused.
 

He didn’t answer. Shit, wait. I didn’t even ask. Oh my god, I screwed up. Goddammit. 

 
The younger swiftly made his way to the driver’s seat with the elder already in the car.
 
“Um, Minnie. Will you marry me?”
 
“My answer,” the elder simply smiled before reaching into a bag and taking out a small white violet plant. He handed the flower over to the flustered other, adding, “Well this worked out fantastically.”
 
Jongdae looked at him, silently asking a million questions. He then looked at the small labeled card attached to the plant.
 
“Meaning of White Violets: Let’s take a chance on happiness,” the card read.
 
“Of course I will marry you, my lovely, lovely wife,” he cooed, pressing his lips against the other’s. “I. Love. You. So. Much,” he whispered between kisses. “Let’s go home.”
 
“I’m already there,” the younger breathed.

accidentally keeps adding chapters lol


little white flowers, a swing, and a car
Chapter Notes
Happy Valentine's Day~




Just as Jongdae had told him, Minseok received a small package the following day. He gleefully and carefully cradled it to the living room, anticipation rising with every step.
 
“I wonder what it could be. Ohmygod my Chennie’s hands touched this box. Ohmygosh it smells like him,” he rambled with each motion, opening the box.
 
To his surprise, there was a small handmade card inside, decorated with drawings of little white flowers, a swing, and a car. 
 
Call me when you read this, it read.
 
Minseok sat in silence for a moment. “What if I don’t wanna?” he sarcastically said to no one as he reached for his phone, immediately dialing his husband’s number.
 
“Min?”
 
“Who else?”
 
“Are you really gonna be sassy with me right now?”
 
“No,” he chuckled. “I got the card. Nice choice of packaging, by the way. Is it a new trend to send empty boxes with cards?”
 
Minseok teased the other as he lovingly held the card.
 
“I’m glad you called,” Jongdae smiled. Minseok could hear it in his voice.
 
“I’m glad I did, too,” he replied, loneliness slyly creeping up on him.
 
“I miss you.”
 
“Mmm,” Minseok couldn’t form words with the sudden surge of emotion.
 
“I want to see you. It’s been so long.”
 
A soft sniffle followed a heavy silence. 
 
The two weren’t used to being apart. Any length of time apart would feel like ages.
 
Jongdae felt sorry for leaving Minseok alone for longer than expected, but he knew the benefits, in the long run, would help both of them out. He would be able to support Minseok for the rest of his life without worry if these meetings he’d been attending went successfully.
 
“C-can we facetime?” Minseok finally spoke.
 
“Uhhh, I can’t right now. Sorry,” Jongdae apologized. “Actually, I think I have to end the call right now. I’ll talk to you soon, okay?”
 
“Mmm.”
 
“I love you.”
 
“Mmm.”
 
Jongdae knew Minseok wasn’t happy with him right then. He never denied a video call.
 
Minseok worried. He knew the other would never do anything to harm their relationship, so he was worried about how much they were working him over there that he couldn’t talk for more than a few minutes.
 
Unbeknownst to Minseok, who was too wrapped up in his own thoughts, the door to the house opened quietly and an all too familiar guest let himself in. 
 
He stealthily crept to behind the seat Minseok was in and abruptly enveloped the elder in a tight back hug.
 
“You didn’t say it back,” he mumbled into the other’s soft hair.
 
“Chen?! My Chennie??!?!? Is that really you? Oh my gosh it really is you. You’re back. You fucker, why’d you do this to me?” Tears were flowing out with every word. Minseok stood up and turned into the other’s emotional hug.
 
Jongdae used a thumb to wipe away the elder’s hot tears and left his hand rested on his cheek.
 
“You still didn’t say it. I’m offended,” he pretended.
 
Minseok lifted his chin to fit his lips against Jongdae’s. 
 
“I love you, my lovely wife” he finally said, smiling against the other’s.
 
“Love you, too, Min.”
