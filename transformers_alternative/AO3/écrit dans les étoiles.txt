Summary
Jack didn't go to Samwell and Bitty doesn't follow hockey but through the bathroom of a Beyoncé concert, a ticket to a Bruins game, and a lot of texting, they come together anyways.
Notes
Hey!! Sorry it took me so long to post anything but here's another texting fic. It's an au where Jack never went to Samwell but is still friends with Shitty/Ransom/Holster, he meets Bitty, friendship, relationships, texting, etc, etc. Tw for (small) mentions of anxiety, strong language, and a lot of varying capitalization and punctuation because the whole story's texts, sorry if it gets confusing. I'm gonna round up all the text abbreviations used and put them in the end notes! Title is French for written in the stars because I gave the fuck up on figuring out an English title, thanks Natalie.

          See the end of the work for more notes
