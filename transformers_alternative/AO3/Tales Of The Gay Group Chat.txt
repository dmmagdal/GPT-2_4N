northern george: me neither but it sounds gay
actually jon: basically it's like friendship but better
problematic peter: friends with benefits
actually jon: ….... no
actually jon: well in a way yes but not the kind of benefits you mean
don't call me ashley: why is everyone in here so ignorant and doesn't know about that
actually jon: we live in a world where romantic relationships are considered more important than platonic ones
actually jon: and asexual erasure ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
don't call me ashley: true... but anyway i'd say welcome to the chat, whoever you are, jon's friend with platonic benefitsspence smith has joined the chat, invited by actually jonspence smith: hi flip flops man and friends
actually jon: i told you to stop calling me that
northern george: flip flops man....?
actually jon: IT WAS LITERALLY JUST THAT ONE TIME BECAUSE I WAS TOO LAZY TO WEAR ANYTHING ELSE
spence smith: we met in a library for the first time and he was wearing flip flops although it was freezing outside... i couldn't help but comment on that
actually jon: don't make it sound like you made a badass funny comment... you asked me if i needed shoes and looked ready to give me yours
don't call me ashley: that's so cute wtf
actually jon: yes and then he was like, don't think i'm trying to hit on you i'm ace, and i was like dude me too
spence smith: and since that day we have been forming our small asexual resistance against the world
dan the meme: why did you never mention that jon... you're so secretive
actually jon: i forgot
problematic peter: forgot... of course.,,,, you just don't like us that's why
actually jon: that's true too
