sweetie: THAT . OHYMGOD
sweetie: people like to pretend cheol is the only leader of svt
asseater: tbh when i first stanned i didnt think you were
asseater: idk you rarely talked
asseater: i figured now it was cause your korean wasnt that good
sweetie: pretty much that
sweetie: the leader is suppose to be well spoken, and tho they thought i was good with my words, that was in mandarin yknow

 Is Seventeen's 'The8' dating an openly gay twitter fan?     By: Alyssa Richards 
 

Since the rather iconic reaction from twitter user @minghaobb at discovering his bias in his favorite Kpop group 'Seventeen' had followed him, Carats haven't been able to contain themselves with the excitement of the blossoming friendship between The8 (@xuminghao_o) and Wen Junhui, a university student in Shenzhen.
JUN! @minghaobb
MINGHAO FOLLOWED ME WHY IS NO ONE TLAKIGN ABOU T YHIS CARATS I NEED CONFIRMATION WAS THIS A  FEVER DREAM OR DID XU F******  MINGHAO JUST ACTUALLY FOLLWO ME

TRANSLATED BY BING



 


The8 has even gone as far as to refer to Wen as his best friend, dubbing him 'one of the most important people in my life.' That is to say, that neither have met the other in person, and their friendship remains solely online.  While many of Wen's friend and other members of Seventeen have befriended each other, Carats have noticed there is definitely something different between The8 and Wen's relationship. Some have summed it up to it being more romantic than anything.  Comments on each others Instagram selcas (@wenjunhui) (@xuminghao_o) range from sweet to flirty, sending fans into a spiral of excitement. Not to mention that The8 has openly followed Wen's more nsfw Instagram and his nsfw Tumblr, but the question remains, what is the relationship between @minghaobb and The8?  In years past, Wen had amassed a good sum of followers on all three platforms of Instagram, Twitter, and Tumblr, becoming known as 'Minghao's biggest fanboy.' Shortly after his rise to fame, Wen was asked whether he was lgbt+ and if his 'love for hao was real?' to which he responded with that, "I'm into men, yeah, so I guess you can consider it as real as you want."  And while the discussion of the members of Seventeen's sexuality remains a hot topic, not many openly talk about The8 in particular, but recently, more and more have questioned Wen, friends of his, and even The8 himself on his sexuality.
In the most recent question, he only responded with. "kekekeke Why does everyone care so much? It doesn't change the music." And when confronted with his friendship with Wen, The8 shot back with. "Jun is my best friend! Can you all not leave it at that?"

hannie hyung: .. u guys aren't even dating no offense 

baby chan: I know ojdfjksdj I'm not being serious baby chan: ahhh but I like him so much baby chan: we cuddled n napped at his apartment cause he was sad 

hannie hyung: oh no what happened?

may @sythnmlmaoo ok so vern tweeted that pledis says chan and vernon cant hang out bc of the datkng scandal junhui caused (still mad about  that tbh)           may @sythnm           @sythnm but literally seungkwan ans his VERY OBVIOUS boyfriend are allowed to  tweet sbout their fucking dates off the official account: lmao ok           may @sythnm           @sythnm but 'chan stans have nothing to be pressed abt' ok he has to stay in the  closet in order to keep his job lol           may @sythnm           @sythnm and before ANYONE comes for me n says 'oh but do u know if chan is gay' pledis only  flipped shit when chanon were exposed but everyone was fucking silent about junhao. ill take that as hint enough that chan and vernon are in the actual fuckking  relationship           may @sythnm           @sythnm im not saying seungkwan has it perfect either, the only reason pledis isnt  on his ass abt jihoon is bc of their fucked up sense of masculinity  - since debut pledis  has marketed on its feminine members: jeonghan, seungkwan, and joshua           may @sythnm           @sythnm and for awhile they made chan the "uwu sweet baby boy" but since hes  gotten older they started presenting him more masc           may @sythnm           @sythnm so basically - kwan is allowed to do what he likes with jihoon and be all  uwu boyfriends with him bc of how often ppl compare him to a girl thus its almsot  like he isnt actually gay. bc they make seungkwan act 'girly'           may @sythnm           @sythnm but the minute chan, someone thats been presented as a big ol manly scary  man >:(, has any kind of relationship with a man theres an issue           may @sythnm           @sythnm basically: seungkwan is allowed to be gay and with jihoon because he fits  the gay male sterotype bc pledis presents him feminine but chan isn't because he  acts masc           may @sythnm           @sythnm YO VERNON LIKED THIS THREAD YOU KNOW IM RIGHT

Please send love to Junhui *he's @minghaobb/@flowersupremacist on Twitter!!* ! If you guys don't know who he is, Junhui is one of the Carat friends Seventeen has made! He was actually the first and he's actually Minghao's best friend!!! Lately his tweets have seemed really sad and worrying, personally I think something might have happened with Minghao, or maybe another member, he hasn't interacted with any of the members on Twitter or any other social media. He made a string of tweets + a thread about people asking questions about Minghao. Regardless of that, he's still a very good person, and even if he and the SVT members aren't talking anymore - or just currently - we should ban together and show him that we still support him!!

DN: Helloooo! Oh so many people are joining  DN (to VN): They saw the title and got excited  VRN: We didn't tell them who was hosting, maybe they thought it was about our other Hyungs...  DN: How long should we wait until we tell..?
VRN: At least... Forty-five thousand
DN: So many to know!
VRN (laughing): Are you nervous? (teasing) It was your idea!
DN: I'm not nervous, Nonnie! (quietly, giggling) Shut up! I'm only a little anxious
VRN: We can end the live
DN: No, I want to do this
VRN: Okay
VRN: We've reached forty-seven thousand...
(DINO and VERNON take a seat next to each other on DINO's bed.)
DN: Hi everyone! Vernon and I... We have something to address
VRN: A lot of you probably saw it on Twitter, or other social medias
VRN: ...It's about the article about us two
DN (reading the chat): 'is this you denying the article? i thought that it was already deleted'
VRN: It had been deleted but...
VRN: This is actually us confirming the article
DN (starting to laugh nervously): Nonnie! So blunt!
VRN (takes one of DINO's hands): I might as well be! (to viewers) Dino is my boyfriend
DN (cringing): Nonnie never calls me by my stagename...
VRN: Chan is my boyfriend!
VRN (kisses DINO's cheek): He really, really is!
DN (reading the chat): 'Oh my god! You two are dating!?' We are!
VRN (reading the chat): 'Why was the article taken down?' Well... One, they made a large assumption and it made both of us uncomfortable
DN: We would have rathered to come out on our own terms...
VRN: And... Shortly after [the article] was deleted, we realized we would rather just...
DN: Be open about it
VRN: Channie is already finishing my sentences for me~
DN: Nonnie! Stop!
VRN: Your cheeks are so red! I should bring you roses to match!
DN (to viewers): See how mean he is to me?
VRN: See how cute you are when you pout?
DN: We should end the live here, so I can kick you out of the dorms
VRN (laughing): No, Channie!! I love you!
VRN (reading the chat): 'He could never kick Vernon out' Yes he would! He's done it before!
DN: I'm ending the live!
VRN: Chan, wait-

 
TN: he failed to end it at first and just zoomed in on vernon lmao this nerd i love him -- YUSEUL

Dino's Solo 6/23/18 K-scene Interview Transcript English Trans
 INT: Hello! So Wonderful to have you!DN: Yes! Thank you for having me, Noona. I'm very flattered. INT: You do interviews often. Why so excited over this one?DN: Ah... Most often, I am with at least one - more than often two - Hyungs... I love to be with them, but rarely am I the only one to speak.INT: Ah. Yes, Seventeen. Eight members?DN: Yes! Seven total Hyungs.INT: Although some consider the friends you all have made to be unofficial members. Are they good Hyungs to you as well?DN: Of course! I do really have twelve Hyungs instead. They all are so talented as well. INT: One of those other Hyungs of yours, he's the one we planned to talk about. DN (noticeably embarrassed): Nonnie~ Vernon Hyung, yes.  (TN: This fuckign loser I adore him so much he never calls me hyung and jskdsnskj --VERNON) DN: We've been together for about two months, almost three now. INT: You're one of the first LGBT+ idols out right now, that scare you at all? There still are only a handful.DN: Sometimes. When the article came out I was so definitely scared, but my Hyungs were there for us. DN: Although, I don't know what I consider myself.INT: You're not gay? But you're dating a man. DN: Of course I do care for Vernon Hyung a great deal, so much so it's difficult to put into words...  (TN: SHUT UP YO UUu I LVOE U --VERNON)DN: But I've dated women, too, I've enjoyed dating women.  DN: I think it's more commonly known to be bisexual, but on some level I don't necessarily care. It's about the content of the person. Men, women, I would date someone if they were neither. DN: Vernon Hyung has a very gentle soul, he opens up a lot to me.DN: He's my special person.INT: 'Special person' sounds much more endearing than 'boyfriend' I must say.DN: I do get embarrassed when I mention him.INT: Cute!DN: Ah Noona, you'll make me blush  (TN: HE WAS --VERNON) (TN: Vernon please calm the fuck down we get it youre his bf --YUSEUL) DN: As for being a now queer idol, I do expect a lot of hurtles to come both my and my Hyungs' way.DN: Vernon Hyung is already stopped on the street because he's recognized, people come up to him at his work.DN: It's a little overwhelming. INT: But no one is hateful?DN: Not in person, not yet.INT: It's difficult to be in a gay relationship in Korea.DN: We knew that when we came out, and hopefully we can start to be the change our home needs.  TN: I LOVE MY BOYFRIEND SO FUCK ING M UC H HH --VERNON (who loves chan)

           Lee Chan! ✓ @leechan99            @leechan99 Nonnie is my shooting star! Please care for him like you care for me! His hands are soft, and bigger than mine so when we hold hands his cover mine. And he kisses very gently~ I care just too deeply for him <3

hey guys so u might have seen on twt but Junhui is taking a lowkey break n stuff ?? which I totally get theres obviously something wrong but I noticed a lot carats getting mad at him bc of it. like, Minghao hasn't tweeted/posted on ig a lot n people r saying its juns fault :( idk I don't want people to blame him esp if its obvious upset the both of them? ig what I'm hoping to say is for ppl to just leave his and haos issue to them? like we obvi don't know the full story so like let them deal w it and stop dming / mentioning them in tweets plz
 
#lol OK #obviously jun pissed off hao #he isn't even an idol why does anyone care?? #he fuckign blocked me on twt lmaoo #I bet he tried to finally suck minghaos dick n now hes a #sad gay #honestly I couldn't give less of a shit abt him #he should literally fucking die at this point #who the fuck does he even think he is?

nonnie: I spent the last hour on Instagram looking @ stan accounts why there so many hate stans 
channie: its a scary place thank god I cant speak english
nonnie: ill translate <3 
channie: nonnie-
nonnie: 'why the fuck chan walking arnd like a gay ass bobble head' nonnie: 'bet hes a bobble head cause he bobbing on hansols dick' why are they calling me hansol I didn't agree to this
channie: that's your only issue with everything you just sent me 
nonnie: I mean  nonnie: yes
channie: unu
nonnie: stop that 
channie: ;w; 
nonnie:  ISAID STOP 
channie: don't mind me being a sad gay bobble head 
nonnie: SHUTU O P nonnie: god dammit  nonnie: yknow I have to still acknowledge that Junhui is extremely good looking and it sucks that I'm mad at him cause I wanna like his ig post 
channie: he posted?
nonnie: yeah hes with mingyu hyung I think theyre at a café  nonnie: ik some svt members still talk to him but like nonnie: do u?
channie: sometimes channie: its mostly myself, mingyu hyung, and cheol hyung 
nonnie: ah nonnie: are you mad that I'm still not talking to him? 
channie: do you want the 100% unfiltered truth? 
nonnie: i'd appreciate it 
channie: I'm so fucking frustrated at the whole situation and I really really wish all of you would just talk again or at least try and understand hyungs situation channie: because from what all of you have told me, what hes said, and what I saw no one is trying to even look at it from his perspective in the slightest 
nonnie: what do you mean
channie: nonnie. channie: jun was raped. that's what happened. what happened with hyung triggered something. hes openly said that it made him uncomfortable and now hes reacting  channie: jun is going to continue to say that it was his fault, to say it was the only reason why he's ignoring Minghao. because he doesn't want to shove any of this situation onto Minghao, he doesn't want to shove Minghao into this hole that his abuser left.  channie: and very obviously everyone sees Junhui as being difficult  channie: survivors deal differently, he held off on sex with men (because I believe he told you as well he felt comfortable with women,, I think because it didn't trigger the same memories?) channie: he held off and letting his guard down around Minghao, letting him touch him like that man did scares Junhui channie: and everyone is just screaming at him to talk to Minghao and he very well cant  channie: and what Junhui needs right now is his friends and maybe just  channie: listen to him? none of you experienced assault (at least I don't think. forgive me if I'm wrong)  channie: youre telling him how to feel. telling him when to feel valid, when to comply channie: because 'mingaho didn't hurt you, he didn't mean to scare you, just talk to him,'  channie: you guys cant decide these things for him, if Junhui says he cant talk to Minghao then he cant talk to Minghao right now and you just need to respect that 
nonnie: chan can I ask you something nonnie: its still kinda on topic but also kinda.. off topic? 
channie: sure 
nonnie: you said none of us understand assault or rape which is why we're being huge assholes basically 
channie: in short, yeah
nonnie: is there a reason why you understand Junhui right now?  nonnie: you don't have to answer 
channie: there is  channie: but I don't want to talk about it 
nonnie: okay nonnie: do you want to facetime
channie: yes

I cant remember if you've told anyone else baby chan: I told Junhui and gyu hyung knows baby chan: gyu hyung knows cause we were at an airport and a carat grabbed mehannie hyung: I remember thatbaby chan: and she just baby chan: pulled me back so hard and her nails scratched me and when security finally got her off of me I was bleeding baby chan: and I couldn't stop crying and eventually I just told gyu hyung after  hannie hyung: at this point chan, its totally up to you if vern knows  hannie hyung: whether you want to be sexually active with him or not, that shouldn't change what he knows I guess hannie hyung: it might make things better in the long run baby chan: maybe

the great uwu: hyugn? 
lesser leader: minghao? lesser leader: how are you?
the great uwu: I'm okay the great uwu: you still talk to jun right?
lesser leader: yeah
the great uwu: how is he? the great uwu: please be honest with me
lesser leader: he could be better.. honestly he isn't that good.. hes sad a lot  lesser leader: he and gyu are going to do something. I think hes going to jun and jihoons apartment
the great uwu: he cant even be in the same building as me 
lesser leader: don't talk like that, you know it would be awkward 
the great uwu: hyung can I please ask you something  the great uwu: and please please be completely honest with me the great uwu: pretend like this isn't even minghao youre talking to, pretend I'm someone else  the great uwu: just don't consider how i'll react at all I need the complete truth
lesser leader: what is it?
the great uwu: you know about Junhui  the great uwu: hes told you what happened right? 
lesser leader: the assault? 
the great uwu: yeah
lesser leader: ah
the great uwu: this has been keeping me up for night after night the great uwu: does he blame me for doing something he wasn't okay with? does he think that I like the great uwu: forced it? the great uwu: I'm not saying this like accusingly, like 'I cant believe he would that that what a fuckign dick' but just the great uwu: he was right we were  drunk and ive been so focused on that he was freaking out that 'oh no hao is straight' I never considered  the great uwu: I maybe did do something  the great uwu: something he wasn't okay with the great uwu: I remember touching, I remember what we did the great uwu: but conversation, what lead up to it, I don't remember that I don't know if he said no or if he didn't want to or what 
lesser leader: he likes to say that he thinks he did that to you lesser leader: maybe did to you what that man did to him lesser leader: but I know he doesn't really think that
the great uwu: what does he think then?
lesser leader: from what I can tell and from what hes told me  lesser leader: Junhui so desperately doesn't want to be defined by his assault, even though that affects so much lesser leader: he tries to ignore it, he tries to say hes coped hes dealt  lesser leader: but letting his guard down with you triggered something and hes frustrated because of it lesser leader: because you didn't rape him, you didn't do anything he was against, so why is he so upset and uncomfortable?  lesser leader: I think its because the fact is he hasn't fully healed from what happened, he isn't completely over it lesser leader: and I don't think that you pushed him, I think he pushed himself  lesser leader: to like, get over it. be okay again.  lesser leader: sex, in some sense, is something ruined for him. probably not forever, but for awhile lesser leader: and unfortunately youre involved with that now, youre involved with sex for jun. hes uneasy with you right now lesser leader: probably not forever, but for awhile lesser leader: he cares very deeply for you, so he wants to work out how hes dealing right now and then he can work it all out with you lesser leader: and I guess the question is if you'll be willing to wait and eventually work it all out with him
the great uwu: oh the great uwu: that makes a lot of sense actually  the great uwu: and it makes me feel a lot better.. the great uwu: I'm willing to wait however long for him  the great uwu: I just wanted to know that I guess the great uwu: thank you
lesser leader: anytime lesser leader: and seriously... stop indirecting him on twitter ... carats be wildin

10 Reasons To Love Seventeen's Dino's relationship

 
We were totally blown away when Dino, the Maknae of Seventeen, dropped a bomb by announcing on Vlive he was in a two (now three!) month relationship with Vernon Chwe, a fan translator for Seventeen! Talk about lucky! Following their cute relationship along on social media and in their little updates makes us nothing but happy. Vernon is def #boyfriendmaterial and Dino is obviously super happy! If that isn't enough for you, here's ten other reasons why they're total relationship goals!
 
     1. Nonnie: Seventeen's fandom, or Carats, lost it over Dino's sweet nickname for Vernon - Nonnie. In fact, when a Carat used said nickname Vernon had this to say: 
 
              You fcking bitches y... ✓ @leechanluv
              @shiningminghao u better take that mf name out ur mouth 1 person on this earth is  allwoed to clal me nonnie & u r not lee chan. u fool. ur a fool.  i Willl sue you and  most definetly will win the jury will laugh at you they will call you a fool a coward make a Mockery of your f
             You fcking bitches y... ✓ @leechanluv
             @shiningminghao ailure broadcast it to all of kroea and the americas Every last americas send tweet
 
     2. Vlives: For our favorite Seventeen ship - chanon? verchan? chansol? - vlive has played a decent part. Used to not only publically come out, but also pleasant updates on the two lovebirds. Studies say no one can resist that push notification when they go live!
 
     3. Origin: Image your favorite Kpop group... Now imagine becoming their best friends - okay now imagine dating one of your biases! Vernon can definitely say he's lived the dream when it comes to that. He worked as a   fan translator (with his close friend, Yuseul!) and then nearly overnight, won the heart of our dear Dino here ~ <3
 
     4. That One Thread: Shortly after coming out, Dino had tweeted out a list of things he loves about his Nonnie (including his kisses 0//0) it sparked a fire in the Seventeen fan base! Support coming in giant waves like you would never believe! We love it!
 
     5. Replies: Vernon, the regular Twitter boy, uses the social platform almost daily. But that doesn't stop his boyfriend from sliding into his mentions with replies that range from random 'I love you's to calling him a   headass. Their friends join in, too, giving us quick updates on the behind the scenes of the relationship with anecdotes of conversations and catching the two being sweet. 
     
      6. Appreciation Tweets: The retweet button never looked so good when you come across one of Vernon's love-tweets for Dino. Honestly the boy could be a poet with the beautifully sweet things he has to say about his lover. Dino, too, with his occasional replies that make you all warm and soft. 
 
     7. Dates: Fansites have field days when Vernon and Dino head out. One quick Google search and you can be met with at least fifty different shots of Chansol holding hands, eating out, kissing cheeks, or on double dates with friends of theirs. 
 
     8. Endless Support: There isn't a single doubt Vernon pours as much dedication as possible into not only his ult group, but also his partner. Of course, it goes without saying, it's returned. In regards to his boyfriend's career aspirations or mental health, Dino never fails to satisfy with being there for him constantly. 
 
     9. Selcas: We love! Photogenic boyfriends! Maybe Vernon is a little too obsessed with snapping the perfect shot of Dino while they share brunch, but we won't start complaining anytime soon!
 
     10. Being Out: While it is, by no means, a requirement, Dino and Vernon have taken a huge step for so many lgbt people in not only Korea, but around the world as well - even if the change is slight in some places. It can open the eyes of so many individuals and start hopefully opening doors, too.

jihoon: hey
jihoon: youre totally sure u want to do this?
jun: I mean its not that serious
jun: I miss them

jihoon: feels like a lot?
jun: eh its our friends ill adjust quickly
 
 

----------

 
 
jihoon has added jun to chansol gay yeah 
 
jun: I wanted to be serious when he added me back but can someone please explain the fucking name of the chat first 
vernon: right so that one kpop site w the stupid fucking name made an article abt chan n I being like relationship goals and I called soonie hyung to tell him bc I was like proud or whatever n idfk seokie hyung was either riding him or he just woke up from a nap bc he sounded so fucking out of it and he just responded with 'chansol... gay.... yeah'
soonyoung: I
soonyoung: seokmin and I were Not having sex thanks
soonyoung: I worked a double shift and I was like in a new state of mind 
soonyoung: my third eye opened and I met god 
jun: wow cant believe you met lee chan
vernon: ...am I dating god?
jihoon: yeah
vernon: radical 
jun: yeah but like
jun: back to beign serious
jun: I guess I just want to apologize
seokie: you really have nothing to apologize for?
seokie: like. we were inconsiderate assholes 
seokie: you were right
seokie: we totally didn't see things from your perspective 
seokie: it was just 'Minghao is upset so you have to talk to him'
seokie: and we didn't think about your feelings
seokie: and we're suppose to be your best friends 
jun: I guess
jun: I mean about not needing to apologize
jun: not the best friends thing
jun: you guys are 
jun: I was just
jun: frustrated
vernon: I'm sorry hyung
jun: honestly if I have anyone I still need to apologize its you
jun: everything with chan and the article and allkp*p 
jun: I'm sorry Vernon I'm so fucking sorry
jun: I just
jun: I was so angry and I didn't think about it
jun: its so easy to forget what the situation is like. 
jun: that this isn't just between like a dozen people this is a dozen people with millions of people standing by to eat up whatever drama spills out
jun: I didn't think about how minghao is an idol, I didn't think about how chan is an idol, I didn't think about how there was easily five thousand people that have me on tweet notifications and would see that in seconds
jun: all I thought about was what you said and that it pissed me off
Jun: and I should have been more mature about it, I should have been smarter
vernon: thank you
vernon: really
vernon: I accept the apology 
vernon: and besides, now that chan and I are out it doesn't... seem like such a big deal? 
vernon: like clearly I know at the time it was a huge deal like 
vernon:  thinking about chan and how he reacted just
vernon: if anything that's what got me so upset?
vernon: like if it had just been management wants to talk to him about some dating rumor we had, that allkpop was writing dumb shit, that some carats were more convinced we were dating I would have acknowledged it as just another day ? something is always starting up in the fandom
vernon: but he cried so hard, he was shaking and just
vernon: he was hanging off me and he couldn't even stand up on his own and he just kept saying 'nonnie what do we do what do I do what are we suppose to do' and it broke my fuckign heart 
vernon: I just got so protective 
seokie: ugh when will my bf ever 
soonyoung: ill fight a fucking tree for you
seokie: mwah
vernon: I'm sorry for how I reacted hyung
vernon: flipping out on you
vernon: what I said about Minghao...
jun: that I wasn't... happy about hearing, but it was kind of my last priority to process
jun: you just love him a lot don't you
jun: its really easy to see, how much you love chan
jun: and I think its so beautiful
vernon: thank you
vernon: I don't know... I get overwhelmed by my feelings for him a lot
jihoon: thts so cute
vernon: like! idk past bfs have always either been a hit or miss within like two months
vernon: and even the 'hits' were always rocky
vernon: but its so easy to fall into place with chan
vernon: it scares me a little
seokie: yall r so young
seokie: and no I don't mean that condescending 'uwu u know nothing abt love or life vernon lee' 
vernon: H
seokie: but I mean I completely and wholeheartedly believe you about the love 
seokie: you guys made a huge step by coming out 
seokie: joshua hyung and jeonghan hyung have been together for years and theyre still in the closet 
seokie: its a huge deal you guys did this
seokie: yknow the public will view chan differently forever, they'll see you differently forever. you both knew that and still took that leap because of your feelings for one another
seokie: what I'm saying is
seokie: I'm glad you found each other now, as young as you are, and I hope that the love only grows stronger
soonyoung: a lifetime of happiness 
jihoon: yall acting like they fuckin married 
vernon: I'm.... crying........
vernon: u ever think abt ur boyfs n just sob bc of how much you love them
vernon: I want to marry him one day ohymgofd
vernon: Hyungs please I want to marry him
vernon: like seriously

ALL MY LOVE @ALLMYLOVE_DINO
By actual coincidence, I was in Vernonnie's nursery - Chan arrived and I was too shocked kekeke. I asked him with a scared voice if I might take pictures, he was too kind ^.^ Sweet boy told me he would be flattered
           ALL MY LOVE @ALLMYLOVE_DINO
           @ALLMYLOVE_DINO And I saw such a beautiful moment shared between Chan and his love <3 While I was taking my pictures and I snapped one of a kiss on the mouth, but quickly deleted it. Their affection is a precious thing that should be respected. Chan is so brave already for telling the world who he is
           ALL MY LOVE @ALLMYLOVE_DINO
           @ALLMYLOVE_DINO Love my Chan and love his nonnie for what they choose to show us - don't force the steps of their relationship. I wish them nothing but happiness <333
 
 
JUN! @flowersupremacist
 @ALLMYLOVE_DINO is a good example of how u be a good stan js
 
Lee Chan! ✓ @leechan99
Ahh! <3 I remember you from the flower shop @ALLMYLOVE_DINO You were so sweet~ Thank you for your kind words
          ALL MY LOVE @ALLMYLOVE_DINO

vernom: oh god are you okay?
yusoup: fufkfdkkldk tetsou came home today n I was like half asleep on the couch and he sat on the arm of the couch n he like
yusoup: fuck
yusoup: he started talkignt to me about dinner and cause I was so tired it took me a second but he was speaking Korean
yusoup: n I ws like 'what the heckfuck?'
yusoup: GOD he said hes been fucking learning for me
vernom: si that why hes been gone so often?
yusoup: no apparently he said he only studied while I'm at work/while I was in sk/during his breaks bc he wanted to be sneaky about it
yusoup: so like on and off for the rest of the night we were speak a little Korean so he could practice  
yusoup: and we were talking in Japanese about my trip to sk n I was like talkinh about meeting svt
yusoup: n I was telling him abt how like mingyu called me out for dating tetsou just for looking kinda like chan 
vernom: oh no
yusoup: and like 
yusoup: fuck it wasn't like he legit thought that or anything
yusoup: bc fuck mingyu tetsou only has the same big ass head as chan nothing more 
vernom: that's my boyfriend-
yusoup: then he started asking me why I was dating him
yusoup: like stuff I love about him
vernom: oh no
yusoup: and I was listing all these htings and I like started tearing up
yusoup: and he was like 'awww' bc he thought it was me being emotional but I fucking realized we don't do any thing like that anymore
yusoup: like I said I love when we go on spur of the moment dates and we haven't been on a date in five months
yusoup: and then like
yusoup: I sometimes have this habit of saying things in English/French/Korean when I want to say smth to him but I know might hurt him
yusoup: which I know is shitty but like I hate bottling it up and I hate hurting him
yusoup: and I go 'sometimes I think you don't love me anymore' in krn
vernom: seul..
yusoup: I didn't think he would understand me 
yusoup: and he starts insisting he does and all this
yusoup: and I couldn't stop crying I'm so frustrated with the whole relationship
yusoup: two fucking hours of just talking to cheol and I felt more cared for than entire evenings with tetsou 
yusoup: and I voiced the frustrations and I told him literally everything even abt oppa 
yusoup: just like 'I feel like suengcheol oppa seems to like me and it made me rethink this and how he makes me feel vs hwo you do'
yusoup: and tetsou started crying and saying he didn't mean to take me for granted and stuff
yusoup: and my chest hurts so much I'm in the guest room n hes in the bedroom and I only stopped crying now and idk how long that will fucking last
yusoup: I'm not even sure if we're broken up or what but just
yusoup: it couldn't continue like that at least not like that
vernom: I'm not gonna say you need to talk to him right now
vernom: like by no means, don't get up and demand you define your relationship okay you need time to calm down
vernom: but organize what you're gonna say
vernom: I feel like he said something about hyung 
yusoup: of course he did
yusoup: he started saying he knew that the minute I spend the weekend with idols I would fall for one
yusoup: not in like a 'ur such a fucking hoe' way but in a 'I'm insecure about who I am and idols are like Peak human so why wouldn't you' 
yusoup: and I cried harder cause god its lietrally what ufjkcing happened and can we ppelase call o cnat see mu keybaordd

vernom: of course
vernom: English? cause he might hear us and well...
yusoup: yrah

nonnie: oh
nonnie: yes go ahead I'm right here, I can come to you, we can call right now, we can just text
nonnie: just talk to me
channie: I don't want to talk about it aloud, managers are nearby
channie: but I mean I kind of 
channie: view it as not a big deal at times
channie: just as what happened. I was molested its what happened and 
channie: I don't remember it happening I remember 
channie: someone holding me down, nto letting me move and hands on my hips I remember the hands on my hips and if I think too hard Its like theyre still there
channie: I remember after a lot 
nonnie: like?
nonnie: you don't have to answer 
channie: there were countless times I would wake up naked 
channie: with no memory of taking off my clothes
channie: theyre so vague sometimes I think I made them up
nonnie: people block out traumatic events a lot
channie: its so easy to ignore it at times but other times I feel like I cant think about anything else 
channie: and it makes me sick and it makes me want to cry
channie: there was a time I remember 
channie: the summer, and I remember someone following so closely behind me and I remember feeling so scared
channie: I knew that man
nonnie: chan, its okay
channie: I knew him. I knew him. I trusted him and everytime I think about it I feel so sick I feel like screaming and I want to do irrational things, I want to punch things and hurt someone, I want to hurt myself and I want to kill myself and I get so fucking angry so so fucking angry why would he do that 
channie: its not okay he ruined everything 
channie: I love you and I love being with you I love touching you and making you feel good but he ruined that for so long
channie: I just want to be with you and only you
nonnie: I love you too channie 
channie: can I say some stuff that probably sound weird
nonnie: probably not weird if it makes you feel better
nonnie: but go ahead love
channie: I masturbate a lot
nonnie: honey.. I know that
channie: but I think I like
channie: used that to give myself some sort of weird power over 
channie: the assault because I was completely in control, its me with every say in the situation and I wanted to stop I could stop
nonnie: and when you were with me..?
channie: I trust you
channie: I just completely and fully trust you and you've never done anything I wasn't completely okay with 
channie: and well... I was kind of ... in charge when we were together
nonnie: youre dating the worlds biggest sub
channie: I choose my boyfriends well
nonnie: I love you
nonnie: I'm so sorry you had to experience anything like that
nonnie: I'm so sorry about what happened
nonnie: chan, everything you feel about it is justified and I'm right here next to you. you want to be angry? be angry and Ill be angry with you. you want to cry? cry and ill cry with you
nonnie: I don't know what its like
nonnie: and, honestly, I don't know if anyone will ever fully reach a point where all that ugliness is out of them
nonnie: but I will do every fucking thing possible to help you get as far as you can, ill be there by your side 
channie: I love you so much god I love you I love you  so so much

Yeoun Hyung-Nim: Contacted about another queer interview, any objections?
Lee Chan: no.. what magazine is it for?
Yeoun Hyung-Nim: Called 'Out Magazine' it's American. They offered a translator, but want to know if you'd like your friend to translate.
Lee Chan: yes, I can talk with my boyfriend, hyung-nim
Lee Chan: may I ask you a question?
Yeoun Hyung-Nim: I don't see why not
Lee Chan: do you have a problem with me and vernon?
Yeoun Hyung-Nim: Have I done something to make you think that?
Lee Chan: you seem uncomfortable when you mention him, hyung-nim, and.. a few of you - the other managers - almost refuse to call him my boyfriend..
Yeoun Hyung-Nim: I don't care who you decide to date
Yeoun Hyung-Nim: But I think it was a mistake to tell the public
Yeoun Hyung-Nim: Seventeen and Pledis both are getting the wrong kind of reputation. 
Lee Chan: what kind of reputation do you mean?
Yeoun Hyung-Nim: Seventeen and Pledis are being recognized as some kind of gay idol group and entertainment company. You disregarded how it effects the rest of us when you decided to do this
Lee Chan: but you know that I'm not the only lgbt member of seventeen
Lee Chan: carats pretty much know jihoon hyung and seungkwan hyung are together, you all even allowed him to move into the dorms!
Yeoun Hyung-Nim: Are you speaking informal to me?
Lee Chan: yes, I'm sorry hyung-nim
Lee Chan: the situation is just upsetting me
Yeoun Hyung-Nim: I don't like to tell people where I work anymore because the moment I do, they've all decided to make comments about you
Lee Chan: i'm sorry
Yeoun Hyung-Nim: And With Seungkwan and his friend, they've never confirmed anything, unlike you and your friend
Yeoun Hyung-Nim: Seventeen could have done without dating scandals, it only caused complications 
Lee Chan: people already knew without vernon's or my consent
Lee Chan: other managers agreed it would just be best to officially come out 
Yeoun Hyung-Nim: Because you blackmailed us with Jisoo and Jeonghan, along with Seungkwan
Yeoun Hyung-Nim: Should have been happy with dating regardless of the public knowing or not
Lee Chan: its made a lot of people happy to see lgbt representation in kpop 
Yeoun Hyung-Nim: Your group was already attracting the wrong type of people and now there's only more
Lee Chan: again, I'm sorry, hyung-nim
Yeoun Hyung-Nim: No point in apologizes now.  
Yeoun Hyung-Nim: You have a break coming up, two hours
Yeoun Hyung-Nim: But I expect you'll go running off to your friend anyways?
Lee Chan: I was planning on seeing him, yes 
Yeoun Hyung-Nim: Expected.

Chapter 16
Chapter Notes
**graphics mentions of sexual assault**please do heed the warnings for this chapter in particular, jun & chan get a bit graphic wonwoos part in trauma is slightly altered from his original verse, this version hints at his asexuality as for chan's version of trauma, thats obviously made up. some of those lyrics are taken from vernons actual verse in trauma. its suppose to be basically a remix of the og version (albeit, vernon obviously wouldnt have his part) that includes chans part which vaguely allures to the assault  and for anyone wondering - everything EVERYTHING in this fic is fictitious, wonwoos asexuality is fictitious, chan and juns assaults are fictitious, everything is fictitious! i included the assaults to spread some awareness on male victims of sexual assault and i often see in fanfiction assault to be very glamorized. rape and non-con warnings arent something light, and theyre often included without really focusing on the survivor themself. sexual assault isnt something fun.

        See the end of the chapter for more notes

TRAUMA remix. (트라우마) SEVENTEEN  

     Featuring SEVENTEEN'S S.COUPS, WONWOO, MINGYU, and DINO
     Produced by DINO (디노) & S.COUPS (에스.쿱스) & BUMZU
     Album TEEN, AGE Vol 2.

 
 

[Chorus: MINGYU]

I’m in trauma it’s got me singing
Stuck in trauma I just wanna sing
Blah blah blah blah why can’t I forget  That’s my trauma my trauma yeah

  


[Verse 1: DINO]

Trauma got me bad bad  You've followed me since then  But the before doesn't feel real  Marks left on me that won't quite ever heal  Or will they?  Boxed in boxed in my own world  Stuck in my fantasy like dreaming for it to leave this life  Purple and yellow never matched  But they lined so much  And that maroon skin
(But where did you go?)  Did you even exist?  I say I just want to forget  Truly, I just want it out  So let me do that now  I'll sing this song, but is anyone listening?  Are you?

 
 [Pre-Chorus: S.COUPS]  I’m barely breathing  Like I forgot how  It’s too hard for me  To be lenient with myself  Feels like debt  All the light on me  The stage is getting bigger
But the place in my heart  Is so small

 
 [Chorus: MINGYU]  I'm in trauma it's got me singing  Stuck in trauma I just wanna sing  Blah blah blah blah why can't I forget  That's my trauma my trauma yeah  Now it's got me singing, singing, singing  Stuck in trauma I just wanna sing  That's my trauma my trauma yeah

 
 [Verse 2: WONWOO]
Brrrr brrrr
Accustomed to being forgotten
That's my immaturity
And my hidden half
Trauma arising
From my doubts
What is the reason I'm alive?
I try to force myself
To make you let me alone
Unfortunately make me miserable
Do you think I'm damaged? 
I just wanna sing
Or else I'll be more trapped in my trauma
My mind
Has become impoverished
With the broken ideals
Of who you wish I was
Can I not have love alone?
Where is the end to this trauma?
I ask for nothing, but to allow me a hand to hold

channie: oh  channie: o h,,
nonnie: sorry
channie: no its okay
nonnie: jun mentioned you talk about stuff in your verse, so I gave it a listen nonnie: and I feel dumb for not realizing before  nonnie: he also said you've talk to him about it nonnie: you told me... you don't remember that stuff...
channie: yeah I did and  channie: Im sorry I shouldn't of lied
nonnie: no chan please nonnie: its up to you nonnie: 100% up to you if you want to talk about this stuff  nonnie: don't feel guilty for not talking about it with me nonnie: jun understands it differently than I do nonnie: and if its easier to talk to him about it, then that's okay
channie: I mean channie: I want to talk to you about it channie: I want you to know what I went through  channie: because its obviously important to you, but its also important to me that youre not so completely in the dark about it 
nonnie: and if you need more time that's okay
channie: it scares me to talk about it out loud sometimes  channie: and when I do, I always cry channie: because it feels so real when I say it  channie: like . saying the words hurts
nonnie: im sorry that I don't know what to say
channie: its alright 
nonnie: do you want to talk about it?
channie: yeah
nonnie: whenever youre ready
channie: I remember when I was seven I tried telling my mom that my crotch hurt channie: it burned from being rubbed and touched too much channie: but she just gave me medicine to rub into my skin so it wouldn't hurt, and I went to her so much I just took the medicine so she wouldn't be bothered anymore channie: and I don't know if she ever knew, but ive never tried to talk to her about it since
nonnie: ive read things about kids being molested and then their parents never tell them so they can just block it out 
channie: I don't know what I hope - for them to know or for it to stay a secret channie: but I know something happened channie: he would make me wear his clothes channie: he would pass on his shirts to me and even though they were too big on me I was forced to wear them channie: I stunk like him channie: he was always around me channie: I couldn't escape him, it felt like a chain wrapped around me channie: and I cried so much as a kid, over such small things, and my parents would always send me to him  channie: cause he said he knew how to make me feel better channie: and then after that channie: id cry more channie: and it just kept fuckign happening 
nonnie: oh chan..
channie: nonnie please believe me when I say I don't remember who he is  channie: but I just channie: I remember strange times
nonnie: like? 
channie: three months after I became a trainee, I went back home for holiday  channie: at the time an actress in the west came out about being sexually assaulted as a kid and they were talking about it  channie: and he said 'I don't understand how anyone could do that to a kid' channie: and I remember feeling so angry and disgusted, I remember I wanted to scream at him channie: and then he looked up at me and said "don't you agree chan? isn't it disgusting how someone could rape a kid?' channie: but I knew it was him then, I knew it was him but now when I try to wrack my brain I cant  channie: see his face
nonnie: was he trying to throw you off with that comment? about assault?  nonnie: like if he drops comments like that then you'd rule him out in your head
channie: yeah, I think so channie: its been ages since ive been home  channie: ive seen my parents, but not the family friends, not extended family channie: because im so scared that if he channie: shows up ill remember and  channie: I don't know if I can say it channie: and I wouldn't even consider it if I knew it stopped at me, if I could 100% say that I was the only one  channie: but I know it'll never just be me
nonnie: its okay chan
channie: no its not fucking okay Vernon  channie: I have a younger brother, I have cousins, my neighbors kids  channie: if I knew they were safe I would never say anything, but the idea I could prevent them from being hurt channie: but I don't know who to accuse and its such a serious thing ot accuse 
nonnie: are you alright?
channie: he held me down so hard my hips were bruised  channie: the nights I would wake up sweaty and naked, I looked for more bruises  channie: and sometimes I look for them now  channie: I hate him I fucking hate him I hate him so fucking much 
nonnie: I hate him too nonnie: I hate him so much it fucking boils my blood  nonnie: you never deserved that chan, I don't know why it happened, but you never fucking deserved that 
channie: I hate myself for not saying anything 
nonnie: chan, please don't nonnie: youre putting too much on yourself

Chapter End Notes
sorry about the long break + the short chapter i heard some news recently, about a boy i went to highschool with, and it was very overwhelming to be online a lot and difficult to find the energy to update i knew him since middle school and about a week ago he was shot and killed by police, it just started making national news and i just didnt find any real motivation. we knew each other, but not all too well, so i think i'll be okay for the most part.his name was antwon rose, please remember that name, dont let him be forgotten as another victim of police brutality. say his name.

  jun: is everything okay? jihoon: ehjun: you and seungkwan had a fight?jihoon: he thinks I don't love him. 
jihoon: we had our argument and he ended it with 'why did I ever fucking think you actually loved me'
jihoon: and im just so fucking frustrated because I very fucking obviously would move mountains for him, I would give him the world
jihoon: but no because I told him I used to like someone im still close with, he's convinced that im still into them
jihoon: and like.. I see the logic in that but why the fuck doesn't he trust me? 
jihoon: if I thought even slightly I still had feelings for them, why would I tell him jun: wait who did you like?jihoon: .jun: cmon tell meejihoon: jesus christ
jihoon: you breathe a word of this to anyone.jun: you'll cut my balls off, got itjihoon: when we first met, and then for about the next fucking year I was like
jihoon: really fucking into seokmin jun: seokie? seriously? jihoon: yeah okay, I really really liked him and I never had a lot of crushes before then so
jihoon: I got overwhelmed when I started to like him, and it spiraled into something bigjun: when did you get over him?jihoon: when soonyoung started looking at him the way I did
jihoon: I always knew he loves soonyoung, so I came to terms with the fact I would never be with seokmin
jihoon: and then after I saw soonyoung felt the same, I started to move on
jihoon: took awhile but I did it
jihoon: this morning seungkwan was joking to me about how he used to like cheol hyung for a hot minute
jihoon: so I admitted I had a crush on seokmin
jihoon: and … he asked if I still liked himjun: im pretty sure u dontjihoon: I don't
jihoon: but kwan,, he's insecure 
jihoon: aand I used the word lovejun: jihoon..jihoon: I said 'I used to be in love with seokmin - obviously not anymore'
jihoon: and then he was quizzing me
jihoon: asked me all the generic question like when, how long, were we ever together
jihoon: and then he said 'youre still so fond of him, more than me'
jihoon: and we bickered about how I definitely DO like kwan more than seokminjun: what made you leave?jihoon: seungkwan called himself a cheap replacement, said the shit about me never loving him, and then cheol hyung comes in and says that I should probably go
jihoon: omw to yours, if that's okayjun: totally fine
jun: I can talk to seungkwanjihoon: just see if hes okay  
**----------**

hao: in my head I always thought of it as a long time ago
hao: yearsjihoon: I met the guy
jihoon: the one who raped jun
jihoon: that night was their first official date, but he would hang around the studio, or with jun at my old job
jihoon: he was always kind of gross
jihoon: jun was totally convinced this guy was a sweetheart, but everytime I talked to him, he was just grosshao: how?jihoon: one time they both ordered something to eat, jun left for a sec to use the bathroom, and the guy leaned over to me and nodded at jun and said 'you think he'd ever let me fuck him?'
jihoon: it was like a HUGE topic jump so i literally choke and he says 'he's got that nice little ass, I think he would. you should see the way he shows himself off to me, like a slut.'hao: oh my fucking god.
hao: just 
hao: thats revolting jihoon: he'd say shit like that to me a lot
jihoon: the day jun left for china I found the guyhao: what did you do?jihoon: I beat the shit out of him

I realize, as an openly lgbt idol with a same-sex partner, that not all our Carats still completely support the community. And even if they themselves do, many in their lives don't... Understanding the situations many of you are in, don't speak out against it if it's dangerous or the uncertainty is too great, but don't let the hate consume people if you can <3           save the bees @rainychoi

Chapter End Notes
okay I need opinions!!I have an idea to write a music school au for ~most likely~ chansol. idea is that they would be roommates and one would be super skilled with the piano while the other a whole prodigy and can play most any instrument he attempts. its like a friends to lovers sort of thing but they are constantly at each others throats, and I think chan would be the pianist and vernon would be the prodify, but does this at all sound interesting?? I would include the other members + a few different idols in minor roles, but I just want to know if anyone would want to read it?

  jusst-peachy Asked: hey I saw on ur twt (plsu like everywhere) ur display is that 'homophobe lee chan' joke can u explain that bc its honestly confusing me ?? is he actually homophobic?? I only just recently got into svt tho, like a week or two ago      17eventeen Answered: ok so rn svt is getting a lot of recognition bc one they befriended a few lowkey ~fandom famous~ carats (someone called them gay5 as a joke n like Well) n what ppl r loosing it for is that chan and one of the carats, vernon, are publicly in a relationship. which is huge obviously. anyways vern is still a fanboy n everything so he still tweets abt whatever n he was talking abt facing homophobia in hs n idrk ? what happened from there but I guess chan jokingly called him a fag and this girl lost her fucking mind bc she didn't know chan was his bf and thought chan was legit trying to be hateful honestly it was kind of funny #im sorry for reblogging this #ITS JUST SO FUNNY #chan: is openly lgbt #carats: HOMOPHOBIA #CHAN GOT SO CONFUSED LIKE #he texted me n he was like 'nonnie wtf do I do how do I just explain im fuckin gay bro' #n I was like … just do it like that babe … tf #still waiting for chan's casual 'im gay' tweet #or maybe just 'im pan' #either way. new fandom joke. #still better than kimbap kidding

  Lee Chan! ✓ @leechan99 Addressing the homophobia rumors - Wonwoo Hyung has been one of the biggest supporters of my relationship with Nonnie… And in all honestly, aside from with Nonnie, being paired off with my Hyungs (Seventeen Hyungs or otherwise) makes me uncomfortable as well.

Chapter End Notes
also another chansol idea which im hesitant abt N LIKE BAD THINGS HPAPENchan been inlove w Bernon since college, but he never said anything. they graduate and like within a year they both meet seungkwan, immediately become very close friends, and then kwan n vern start dating heres the kicker:verkwan gets mf married like suuuper soon, like barely a year into their actual relationship bc theyre just so ~in love~n chan is hurting bc hes still in love with vern but he says nothing BUT shit starts going down issa bad time dont do anything theyre doing kids

hao: they sometimes all get like 'wow!!!!! minghao!!!!! u go!!!!' when i speak mandarin so thats a little overwhelming bc theyre making this big deal out of it whihc
hao: i mean i get?? im like that with them when joshua hyung speaks english n all that 
hao: but he gets embarrassed too but to not the same extent?
hao: bc he did grow up speaking a fair bit of korean so its not so foreign to him. but i never spoke anything besides mandarin until i came to korea so its so ??
hao: especially alien to me cause they treat my speaking mandarin like this big feat when itslike. my first language ive spoke this my whole life its what i know and what im comfortable with 
hao: its just embrassment really 
hao: and sometimes theyll come into my room and try to be like "omg what r u saying" and its like. pelase.

Seventeen's 'The8' Dating Twitter Famous And Openly Queer Fan

By: Elise Nelson

Excitment arises in Seventeen's fanbase when The8 and his close friend, and fan of Seventeen, Wen Junhui, announced their relationship on vlive.
After Dino, another member of Seventeen, did the same two months ago with his now public boyfriend Vernon Chwe, Seventeen is quickly began recieveing reconginition as the queer Kpop group.

The8 and his co-leader, S.Coups, had this to say, in a recent interview:

      T8: I wouldn't quite say we're 'a queer Kpop group' … In fact, S.Coups Hyung is dating a female fan and friend of ours. 
      SC: *Laughs* Yes, he means my girlfriend, Han Yuseul… We've been together a while now. Many carats know about her and adore her a lot!

      SC: Yeah. We have LGBT+ members, but that shouldn't define us as a whole.

      T8: Granted, we understand that we [Dino and The8] might almost... Set an example  for some people, in a way. Dino and myself, we might be some of the only LGBT+  people - idols or not - that some might even just know of. Whatever we do now, it  defines their idea of what gay is.

      SC: Which, to be frank, is toxic behavior.

      SC: People should be viewed without judgement or prejudice, sadly things don't  always work out that way... But I will take this as my opportunity to say that our  dongsaengs do not speak for the LGBT+ community as a whole by their actions,  thoughts, or words. They are their own individuals. 

      T8: It's easy to let how the 'one gay person you know' create the abstract idea of what  being queer is - but that's where stereotypes can emerge. It's harmful to the  community, so please, treat every person with respect and without judgement  regardless of what their sexuality is.

I've loved you for longer than you may know, and my hearts grows with adoration everyday just because of you. The things that fall into place of you - your laugh, your lips, your smile, your hands, your eyes, you, you, you - they have become what I crave to see, to touch, to know will always be in my life. Any other words fail me, but I love Wen Junhui with my entire heart.

Chapter Notes
thanks for reading this guys <3 I love u guys hey !so, it's come to an end..honestly I never saw this getting as much attention as it did? this started as a fic in my docs, something I would work on when I was bored, and eventually I started posting this. and it was getting so many readers and hits and kudos and just the support has been insane! seeing your comments always make my day! its just great to see so many people who love seventeen come together to read my stuff.. I know a lot of the topics in this fic haven't been exactly light and I had them to bring awareness and to vent about my own experiences.. but still! you all stuck by me! and I just love y'all so much and I hope you enjoy my future writing as well! ps: this is never going to be the last of yuseul <3

        See the end of the chapter for more notes

hi!! so ive been meaning to ask you about this for awhile now but ive felt a little awkward about it 
if u don't know, s.coups actually DOES have a girlfriend, he's mentioned her in interviews before!
and I cant help but think its a little disrespectful to have your @, yknow it might make his actual girlfriend uncomfortable 
so maybe you could change it to something else? 
and a heads up! two other members are in relationships too! both minghao and chan have s/o's
 
wow u narrowly avoiding saying that they have boyfriends was so slick
yesi know cheol oppa has a girlfriend?? lmfao what 
 
if you know you should really change it!! she has a twitter too so she might see it 
 
.. do u follow her 
 
no 
 
of course you don't.. 
idk how to explain to you that 
im his girlfriend??
 
hah no, I mean legitimently, seungcheol oppa has a girlfriend, shes friends with chan's s/o too
 
OH MY GOD... first of all,
JUST CALL HIM CHAN'S BOYFRIEND-- 
second of all, yes I know cheol oppa's girlfriend is friends with vernon, because im his girlfriend and vernon is my best friend  
 
youre actually his girlfriend? 
sounds fake but ok
 
FFFF hold on
