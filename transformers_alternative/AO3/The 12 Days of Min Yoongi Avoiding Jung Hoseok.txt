The 12 Days of Min Yoongi Avoiding Jung Hoseok
by Marshmallowprince
Summary
Jung Hoseok and Min Yoongi are coworkers at a cafe owned by Kim Seokjin. Yoongi is quiet and aloof. Hoseok is friendly and loving.  Hoseok knows he's hiding something and he wants to find out what.




Chapter 1



Yoongi was a difficult man to get to know. Hoseok was aware of this. That’s why he never stopped trying. Yoongi started working at the cafe in the middle of October, as a fresh transplant to the city, he was glad to take any job that first came his way. Other than that, Hoseok knew nothing about the mysterious man with mint hair. Over the course of two months he tried. He asked him where he was from--”small town”, why he moved to the city--”just because”, what he does in his spare time--”not much.” Min Yoongi was a man of few words. He was a good worker, sure. He quickly made what was ordered, cleaned what needed to be cleaned, smiled when he needed to smile; but otherwise he was stoic. It seemed that whenever Yoongi wasn’t pretending to be someone else, he was no one. Every move he made was robotic. Hoseok spent a lot of time observing him. He knew there was more to Yoongi than just a good worker. He tried to reach out to him, to make him feel welcome. He invited to him to every Friday night employee karaoke party, every monthly picnic, and Yoongi always declined. “Oh come onnnnnnnnnnnn.” Hoseok whined when Yoongi, of course, declined the invitation to attend the cafe Christmas party. Why was he even a little bit surprised? “You’re not working, you’re not not going home, why not?” “I don’t want to.”“BUT WHY?”Yoongi didn’t even look in Hoseok’s direction, he just kept cleaning the espresso machine. “It’s no one’s business what I do in my freetime.”Hoseok reached over and snatched the cloth from Yoongi’s hands, earning an annoyed glare. “But what do you do in your freetime?”He shrugged, “Stuff.” Grabbing the cloth again, he went back to work on wiping down the machine. There was no use to keep prying. Did he just dislike everyone he worked with? Or was he like this with everyone? Maybe he has a dark secret. Maybe he’s a spy and living a double life.Whatever it was, Hoseok was determined to find out. He and Yoongi were closing the cafe at four today; so when they left, Hoseok planned on discreetly following him to where ever he was going.Normally he would feel a bit weird about following someone, but he had worked with Yoongi for two months now but knew nothing about him. Not his favorite color, not his birthday. Nothing. They finished the last of their duties and walked out together. Hoseok locked the door behind him and turned to his silent coworker. “Well, see you in the morning?” Yoongi nodded and turned as he sauntered away. Hoseok started in the other direction, glancing over in secret to make sure Yoongi was far enough away to not hear his footsteps approaching him. When he was sure he wouldn’t be caught, Hoseok briskly took off in the direction that the other went. Though he wondered if this made him weird, he kept Yoongi’s adorable mint colored head in his view while he carefully navigated around the people also on their way home. It seemed like Yoongi would never stop walking, he kept at the same pace, his legs never slowing down even for a second. He must have somewhere to be.Then he took a sharp turn into a 3 story shopping center. Hoseok slinked inside as well and he knew that he definitely could not be caught now, especially considering he was around 2 miles in the opposite direction from his own home.  He watched as Yoongi entered the elevator. Hoseok would take the stairs so he wouldn’t be seen. But then what? There were three floors, how would he know which one to go to? He figured he could just glance in every store, seeing as Yoongi’s hair wasn’t exactly difficult to hide.Halfway up the stairwell he paused and took a moment to think. This was pretty weird. Why did he care so much? Of course he thought Yoongi was cute, but he had no personality. Whatever, he made it this far, he can’t turn around now. When he reached the second floor he scanned the area for Yoongi, nothing. He could have just missed him. But he made the decision to go to the third floor regardless.Before he reached the stairwell he saw the elevator doors open, there was his target. Hoseok quickly ducked behind a cardboard Christmas display. He peeked out as he watched Yoongi enter a department store. Great--it’s easy to lose someone in there. He quietly followed him in, weaving around the clothes, first the women’s then the men’s, then the children’s. And then he disappeared into the lingerie. “Oohhhhhhh, he must have someone special.”  Hoseok whispered under his breath. Stupid, he thought. There are two weeks till Christmas, he’s probably just shopping for presents. Hoseok metaphorically hung his head and started his walk home.



Chapter 2



The next morning Hoseok was preparing the cafe for the day when Yoongi entered for his shift, looking as tired as ever. “Hey Hoseok can I ask you something?” This was the first time Yoongi had spoken to him first. Normally he just walks in, responds in to Hoseok’s excited “good morning!”’s with a dejected tone, and gets straight to work. “Sure Yoongi, what’s up?”“Well...since you’re the shift manager, I was wondering if you could schedule me for more hours?”“More hours? But you’re already at 35.” For some reason Yoongi’s facial expression seemed to be begging. Something struck a chord in Hoseok, “Yeah, sure, I can do that.”  He thought to himself, wow, he must have a lot of Christmas shopping to do. Maybe an expensive girlfriend. Or maybe...two?? Does he have a mistress?Yoongi seemed oddly relieved, “Thanks Hoseok.” There was a small smile edging at the corners of his mouth. Their day went as usual. Yoongi stayed faithful to his computerized style of work. Hoseok danced around the cafe as he cleaned, took orders, made drinks. A buzzing began in Hoseok’s back pocket. He saw that it was his best friend, and he decided to answer it. “Taehyungieeee how are you?”“Go shopping with me today.”Always straight and to the point, sometimes Tae could be...strange.“Sounds good! Since it’s Saturday, I get off of work at 7 today.”“Cool. I’ll swing by then and pick ya up.”“Cool!” Then Taehyung hung up. Eavesdropping slightly on the phone conversation, Yoongi approached Hoseok. “I can cover your shift for you if you need to go somewhere.”Hoseok was taken aback by how unusually talkative Yoongi was being today. “Oh no! It’s okay. You get off at two today so you should rest. My friend wanted to hang out is all. Nothing important!  He can wait!”For some reason he noticed that Yoongi seemed a little disappointed that he wouldn’t be stuck inside the cafe longer. Perhaps he really enjoyed it here. Could it be, he actually enjoyed being around Hoseok? ____________________________________________________________Just as the cafe door was being locked for the night, Hoseok saw Taehyung’s black corvette pull up to the sidewalk. The driver seat window rolled down, “Get in loser we’re going shopping.” Hoseok let himself in and looked at Taehyung, they shared a brief moment of silence before screaming in excitement that they were together again. “I MISSED YOU SO MUCH MY HOPE.”“AHHHHHH TAE IT'S BEEN TOO LONG.” “LET’S NEVER SPEND FOUR MONTHS APART AGAIN!”They hugged each other quickly as more inaudible screeches and yells left their bodies. When they pulled away, Taehyung made a straight face and said “let’s bounce.” Though, he started to laugh as they drove away. They pulled into the parking garage of the ever-so-familiar shopping center. Taehyung announced that he was looking for a warm pair of socks for his mother (among many other things), but most importantly, socks.  So, they headed to the department store, where Hoseok had followed Yoongi yesterday.Shopping with Taehyung was fun, but God-was he painfully slow. He had to pick up everything, think about everything, and then 95% of the time, he would shrug and put whatever it was back down. In the distance there was a display of the North Pole, which included a man dressed as Santa Claus who was there to listen to children’s Christmas wishes and take pictures for family mementos. Scattered about the area there were also a few people dressed as elves to assist in lines and photo taking. “You want to go see Santa?” Hoseok laughed, nudging Tae with his elbow.“Duh. Why else would I come here?” He joked in response.Regardless of whether they did intend on sitting on Santa’s lap they made their way to the elaborate display. Just as Hoseok had done a moment ago, Taehyung nudged his friend as he laughed. “Look at that sad elf.”  Hoseok looked up from the candy gift set he was admiring and focused his eyes on the direction Taehyung’s eyes were guiding his vision. At the front of the line stood a small mint haired elf. His sorrowful expression was much in contrast with his brightly colored green and red clothes adorned with bells and his little green, pointy hat. “Wait. I think I work with that elf.” “You can’t work with that elf, he works at the North Pole obviously.” Tae continued to tease. Hoseok gestured for for his friend to be quiet while the familiar elf’s eyes met his. Hoseok was certain he was looking at Yoongi. And Yoongi was certain he was looking at Hoseok. Yoongi’s face dropped, panic setting in as he looked down to the floor and turned around hoping that somehow he wasn’t recognized.



Chapter 3



Early the next morning Hoseok entered the cafe preparing to work his shift. He was scheduled to work with Yoongi today, as he had requested more hours. Though, much to his surprise he found the owner, Jin behind the counter. Also much to his surprise, Jin did not seem to be his usual cheery self.
He appeared confrontational as he almost glared at Hoseok. “Did something happen yesterday?” “What?” Hoseok asked, confused.“Yoongi called me last night and asked me not to schedule him with you anymore. That’s why I’m here.” It was no wonder Jin was feeling suspicious, because Hoseok now was as well.“I mean, I did see him while I was shopping...but all I did was see him.” The bemusement on his face could be seen from a mile away.Jin just shrugged as he stacked up the cup supply for the day. “Well, I don’t know him and neither do you. I’m inclined to believe you, Hoseok, because we’re good friends. I just don’t know about Min Yoongi.”_______________________________________________________________________ The day went on, and Hoseok couldn’t get his mind off of why Yoongi wanted to avoid him so badly. All he did was see him dressed as an elf, Hoseok didn’t mind. He didn’t understand what was such a big deal.He had a possibly, not-so-great idea. He could enter the cafe during Yoongi’s shift tonight to try to make amends. Not that there was much of a relationship to mend. And it crossed his mind that he might seem creepy once again; but he wasn’t going to confront Yoongi for his own self-satisfaction. Hoseok knew that there had to be a reason Yoongi seemed so sad. No one is that sad for no reason. Even though they weren’t friends, he wanted to let Yoongi know that he wasn’t completely alone. Finally when he had finished his work for the day he decided to run some errands to kill time before Yoongi would arrive. He called Tae to help pass the time, explaining the situation. “Probably ashamed” was Taehyung’s hypothesis. The elf outfit was a bit embarrassing, he had to admit. But surely it was nothing to hide over.“It’s an elf costume for crying out loud, Hoseok” Taehyung continued. “Of course he is ashamed. He had striped tights on. Striped. Tights.” “It’s Christmastime! Everyone should be dressed as elves. It’s not that bad.” Hoseok sighed into the phone behind held by his head and shoulder, as he put a few cups of ramen into his grocery basket. “What do you want me to tell you? Oooooh, maybe he has an elven fetish and likes you. You just walked in on him intimately exposed before you guys even had a proper conversation.” Hoseok was getting a little annoyed at his friends jabs. “Come on Tae-”His words were cut off. “Bet he likes you though.” “Not a chance. He-”“Bet he likes you.”  Hoseok was reaching the checkout line, the beeping of the item scanners growing louder. “Okay, okay. Good talk. I’ve got to go. Talk to you later Taetae.” And with that, he hung up.  2:22 PM. Yoongi should be at the cafe for sure by now. Groceries and all, Hoseok made his way back down the street for the second time today. In his head, he practiced what he would say. “Don’t be embarrassed about being an elf”? Well, only time would tell.  The bell on the cafe door rang to signal his entrance. Hoseok heard Yoongi’s daily robotic cheerfulness that he had grown so used to. “Hi! Welcome to-”Yoongi went silent when his eyes met Hoseok again. He wanted to hide. But he couldn’t just sink behind the espresso machine. Hoseok had already seen him, and he was the only employee right now. In his panicked state he blurted out the out the only thing he could think of. “FINE. I’m an elf in my freetime okay? You caught me! Min Yoongi is an elf everyone!” He was lucky there were no customers. A response like this was incredibly unexpected and Hoseok froze in his place, it was as if the icy wind from the outdoors made it inside. Hoseok may have caught him off guard first. But today Yoongi caught Hoseok really off guard. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity of standing wide eyed with his mouth slightly agape, he stammered a response. “Well. I just came here to apologize if there was something I did to make you feel uncomfortable. But-”Yoogni was looking down at the floor, refusing eye contact with his coworker. “No need. I was just-”“Embarrassed?” “Yeah…”Hoseok bent over and looked up so that he was making eye contact again. “It’s okay. There’s nothing to be embarrassed about and there’s nothing to be ashamed of. Hell, I don’t get paid when I wear an elf suit. At least you do.” His booming laugh echoed through the empty establishment. Yoongi couldn’t help but smile and laugh a little bit too.  With that, Hoseok grabbed one of the free samples of Jin’s famous lemon bars and turned to leave Yoongi to finish his shift in peace.As he left, he didn’t turn around. But if he had, he would have seen that Yoongi watched him with a smile on his face and a twinkle in his eye that hadn’t been present for a very long time.



Chapter 4
Chapter Notes
Thank you so much guys for all the subscriptions and kudos! I've only recently started writing so I really didn't expect anyone to even read these. I hope you're enjoying the story so far.I apologize for such a short chapter. I didn't want to leave a cliffhanger in the next part so I ended this chapter here.From now on the chapters will be a bit longer. Thanks for reading!



When Hoseok returned to work the next day he was shocked once again to find who was already there. It wasn’t Jin, and it wasn’t the other barista, Jimin...but Min Yoongi in the flesh. This time Yoongi was the first one to talk. “I’m sorry about requesting not to work with you. It was dumb of me.” Hoseok waved his hand at him and said, “Don’t even think about it!” He didn’t want to meddle, but he wanted to try to spark up a conversation. “Hey Yoongi, when’s your birthday?”“March 9th...when’s yours?” Hoseok was taken aback for the second time in less than 24 hours. What’s this? A conversation? Yoongi  answered and asked ME a question? “February 18th.”“Oh, so right after Valentine’s day then. I can remember that.”Hoseok was shocked. What is this that’s making Yoongi act so open right now? Is he flirting? What??As Yoongi sat cross-legged on the floor drawing the daily holiday specials on the chalkboard, he started to laugh to himself. “Hoseok...now that the secret it is out. You want to know my elf name?” Halting his work on the espresso machine, Hoseok glanced over his shoulder and questioned with a “hmm?”Yoongi turned his head to make eye contact, he smiled and said “Suga.” Then started laughing again.“Suga? You still have to be cool as an elf, don’t you?” Hoseok replied. He was really enjoying this conversation. Though it felt very out of place to Yoongi’s typical demeanor.“Of course. So, what would be your elf name?” Hoseok thought for a moment. “Something cute...like...Hobi!”Yoongi was facing the chalkboard again but he was nodding his head at the response. They returned to their tasks, it became silent again. But this time, for the first time,  it wasn’t tense or bad silence. They were enjoying each other’s presence. Customers came in one by one, they stayed busy. When Min Yoongi greeted them he didn’t seem so robotic. This was such a sudden and drastic change, Hoseok remained confused but he was happy with the change. When the cafe became less populated the two men would talk more, getting to know each other and even sharing some jokes together. Hoseok learned that Yoongi’s favorite color was white, he likes basketball, eating meat, and what he actually does in his free time is write songs.  The encyclopedia of Min Yoongi had opened up and Hoseok was having a hard time keeping up. Two and a half months worth of getting to know someone was suddenly rushing into his head. The only thing he seemed to avoid talking about was his family. If it was on purpose or not, Hoseok didn’t know. The day passed by much more quickly when the two of them were having fun. This was a side of Min Yoongi that had previously not existed, at least to the eyes of everyone who worked at the cafe. Since today was a weekday, the cafe closed at 4 once again. The sign was flipped to “closed” and the lights inside were somewhat dim. The building smelled of cleanliness with a hint of roasted coffee beans. A smell Hoseok had come to love over the years. “Well...see you.” Yoongi said as he pushed in the final unaligned chair at one of the tables. “Jimin and I are going for a hot pot tonight, you want to tag along?” Hoseok asked, with a small glimmer of hope that maybe the answer after today would be a yes.“Nah.” Yoongi smiled and waved as he exited through the glass door.As expected. Maybe they would never intentionally see each other outside of work. Hoseok would be okay with that. The cafe was cleaned up and ready to be vacant for the night. Or so he thought. Just as Hoseok was about to leave, he noticed that the chalk board hadn’t been erased yet. Picking up the eraser he smiled at Yoongi’s festive handwriting and snowflake drawings. Then at the bottom corner, he noticed something different than the rest. Two elves drawn close together, their faces crafted to look very cheerful. Above each was their respective names written. “Hobi” and “Suga.”



Chapter 5



Alone, and pouring boiling water into the instant ramen cup, Hoseok stood in the kitchen of his apartment. The silence was soon broken by the resounding vibrating of his phone on the counter behind him. An unknown number. A different area code too, probably just spam. But he figured he might as well answer it, just in case.“Hello?”“Hoseok! It’s Yoongi.”“Y-yoongi?” He couldn’t believe what he just heard. “Yeah, I got your number from Jin. Sorry. Anyway, do you like Christmas lights?” How is this the same person he had worked with since October? “Christmas lights, yeah I like them. Of course!” “Uh...well, I was asking because I got two tickets to the place where you can walk through all the light displays. And...do you want to go with me?”Min Yoongi, the King of denying all invitations, had just asked Jung Hoseok, the King of being rejected by Yoongi, to go to a fun event. “I’d love to! When?”“Tomorrow night, at 8:00?” Hoseok didn’t work tomorrow, so he could spend the whole day making sure his outfit and hair looked perfect.“Yes sounds great see you then!” They said their goodbyes, and Hoseok hung up his phone with a relieved sigh. He didn’t know where this interaction would take him, but he was happy to see that Yoongi was finally opening up.________________________________________________________________________________The following day passed very slowly, for both Yoongi and Hoseok. Yoongi spent the morning working at the cafe with Jimin. He wasn’t the same without Hoseok by his side. He felt a little empty without him. For some reason, he felt like Hoseok was someone he could trust, which didn’t happen very often.For the afternoon, he was back at the shopping center in his elf costume handing out candy canes to kids waiting in line, still looking as comically grumpy as always. Hoseok on the other hand was practically swimming in the contents of his closet that were strewn lazily amongst his bed. He and Taehyung had been video chatting over the phone for at least 3 hours while Hoseok dressed, and undressed, and then dressed again. “Can’t you decide at least halfway on an outfit?” Taehyung asked getting more agitated as Hoseok began scrutinizing his choice of sock colors. He assured Tae that this had to be absolutely perfect. Taehyung didn’t really understand why. This wasn’t his wedding day, this wasn’t even a date. All Yoongi had done was simply ask Hoseok if he would like to attend an event with him. Leave it to Hoseok to let his feelings get ahead of reality. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity of deliberation, a verdict was reached. A leather jacket, light blue jeans with a few large rips in them (for fashion,) black lace-up shoes, and wrapped around his neck was a black and white checkered scarf. “Okay...but hat or no hat?”A groan emerged from the other side of the phone. “No hat, Hoseok, no hat.” Hoseok thanked him for his help, but before Taehyung could get another word in, Hoseok was saying goodbye and ending the call. Avoiding Taehyung’s sound advice on how to not act weird.Countless thoughts were running through Hoseok’s head at a million miles a minute. Should he eat dinner before they go? Should he buy a gift for Yoongi? Is his outfit good enough? Maybe the hat would look better. No--his hair looks nice today. Wait no, it’s cold--red knitted hat it is. Perfectly positioning his hat, he kept having to remind himself that this was not a date despite the fact that he had a crush on Yoongi. For now, he should just focus on the fact that Yoongi felt comfortable enough with him to even invite him to something. The address of the Christmas light display was familiar to him. When he was younger he would spend his weekends at the fairs that would pop up over the summers. The Christmas event would be new for him though. It was 7:30 PM already. Time sure flies when you can’t decide on an outfit. He knew if he walked he would be able to make it and not be late so he headed out into the cold. ________________________________________________________________________________As soon as stepped into the property he could see Yoongi waiting for him. His outfit was all black, he wore a long coat and a turtleneck. It fit him so well. And he had mittens. Oh god-the mittens. Something about them made his hands look even more adorable than normal. Maybe it was the fact that he was smiling and waving his hand with all the force he could muster, as high as he could raise it, when he saw Hoseok in the distance. This sequence of events made Hoseok’s heart beat as if he had run all the way here.A bit compromised by the current state of the thumping in his chest, Hoseok walked a little slower to the older man than he truly meant to. Yoongi rushed over. When he came face to face with Hoseok he stood smiling wider than the entire staff of the cafe knew was possible. Though as he was close he noticed that Yoongi’s nose was looking very...red.“How long have you been here?” Hoseok asked, hoping that Yoongi wasn’t waiting too long.“Since 7.” A short answer but his gummy smile hadn’t shrunk at all. Why on Earth would be have arrived so early?  Hoseok thought to himself. He figured it was better to just not question why Min Yoongi did the things that he did. They handed their tickets to the employee waiting at the entrance and officially made their way in. Above them were blue lights strung up in the air, attached to poles on the ground so that they would fall in the shape of a giant Christmas tree floating in the sky above them. In the distance they saw a walkway lined with candy canes, a large tree topped with a shining silver star, ice sculptures, food stands, and what looked to be the most fun, a snow slide where people could race each other.
The two looked around in awe. There was no sign of the sun at this time of night,  but everything was lit up by all of the colorful lights. The biggest issue they faced at the moment was what they were going to do first. Yoongi was always one to save the best for last, so he knew for a fact that the slide was going to have to wait.“Let’s go through the candy cane forest.” He finally announced.Hoseok was happy to be at the mercy of his adorable coworker.  The freshly dropped snow crunched under their feet as they made their way through the path. They weren’t really talking. But it was mostly because Yoongi was too enamored with all of the lights. There was a field beyond the path they were on and he could see reindeer, a sleigh, Santa’s Workshop all made out of lights. One would think the cold air had frozen a smile on Yoongi’s face. It never diminished once, the warmth of his breath visible every time he exhaled.Hoseok would have been enjoying the displays as much as Yoongi if he wasn’t so fascinated by the man in front of him. He couldn’t stop looking at him. Every time Yoongi smiled wider, he could feel his heart speed up. Hoseok didn’t even know why Yoongi invited him here, but he was so happy. Just to be with him. He wished he could reach out and hold his hand.Soon Hoseok decided to break the silence. “Yoongi, are you could?” He asked, hoping that he could slip in an opportunity to get closer. “Nope! Why? Are you?”  The unintentional rejection stung. “Nah, nah I’m not cold.” But he put his hands in his jacket pockets anyway.  He kept his eyes on Yoongi, whose head turned intermittently between each side of the lane, making sure he didn’t miss anything. It took them awhile to make it to the end, which was just a loop back to the main entrance. Sitting where they exited was a Christmas themed petting zoo, complete with real reindeer. Hoseok developed a morbid curiosity of what they would be like to pet. Carefully, he approached them. He was assured by all the staff that reindeer are nice. However,  Hoseok had one too many experiences with goats eating his shirt to trust any hooved creatures again. Finally, he rested his hand on the head of one and brushed lightly. He turned to Yoongi, smiling wide and laughing in relief as he exclaimed how nice they felt. Continuing onward to look at the ice sculptures, Hoseok spotted a man dressed as Santa accompanied by an elf. “Yoongi look, you’ve been replaced.”Yoongi didn’t laugh, which made Hoseok wonder if he just didn’t hear him or he struck a nerve. He decided it was best not to talk again until the other spoke first. The ice sculptures were amazing, beautifully and intricately carved. At first glance they looked just like glass. It was a wonder how anyone could do this. The air between them was still silent. Hoseok was having a hard time determining if they weren’t talking because Yoongi was upset or he was just too preoccupied with everything in front of him. He remained behind the other man, enjoying the view regardless. Suddenly, Yoongi spoke up. “Hey let’s race down the snow slide.” So, there they were at the very top holding on to their individual sleds. Hoseok looked down nervously, shivering a bit at the height.  To his right stood Yoongi, and to his right stood an innocent bystander who was being subjected to Yoongi’s gloating about how he was the fastest sledder in the area. The whistle sounded. Hoseok didn’t even hesitate to go down. The sooner he was back on the ground the better. Yoongi however missed the signal by a couple seconds and then didn’t get the best footing and slid down slower than anyone else that night. After an embarrassingly long and lethargic ride to the bottom. Yoongi finally met his co-worker. He stood up, grabbing his sleigh in one arm. “Congratulations Hoseok! You somehow beat me. I would rematch you but I don’t want you to feel too bad about losing.” Hoseok shook his head and laughed. He held out his hand offering to carry Yoongi’s sled for him. What he was going to say was, “The winner shouldn’t have to carry his sled then.” However, he was only able to get out “the” before he felt a mittened hand entwined with his own bare one. It felt like time stood still. Hoseok didn’t even try to finish his sentence. His facial expression must have appeared shocked and confused because Yoongi quickly let go, recoiling.“I’m sorry! I thought that-- I thought your hand was cold so...I’m sorry.” “My hand is cold.”He looked up from the snowy ground. “What?”Hoseok repeated himself. “My hand is cold. Please hold it.” There was no reluctance to grab Hoseok’s hand again. Yoongi clutched it in his own and skipped to catch up as they walked along side of each other on the way to return their sleds. Since it was so cold outside, it was easy for him lie and say he wasn’t blushing, if anyone asked.Walking hand in hand, they arrived at a more open area with some snowmen left over from other visitors. “Let’s add one to the group.” Hoseok suggested.
He started his work on his snowman, carefully packing snow into a large ball to make a sturdy body. He had lost track of Yoongi, but he figured that he was just building his own as well. “Hoseok. Think fast.” Then a cold mass hit Hoseok’s shoulder with a thud. A snowball. Yoongi disappeared because he had built up an arsenal of snowballs. Tonight he’s full of surprises. Pausing his first task and quickly forming his own snowball, Hoseok hurled it back at the other man. What started as an innocent snowman building time was now an every-man-for-himself snowball fight. It was awhile since Yoogni had had this much fun. He couldn’t remember the last time he was diving out of the way of snowballs aimed at him and laughing. But Yoongi was so caught up in the excitement that he had completely run out of his own supply. So he did the only thing he could do. He ran to Hoseok’s massive snowman body and picked it up, balancing it on his shoulder and locking his eyes on Hoseok.From the other side of the field a guttural “NO” could be heard from Hoseok, who was now forming new snowballs to use as defense.
Realizing that Yoongi was approaching him much faster than he thought possible. He took off running, leaving his pile of snowballs behind. It was futile. Yoongi was too fast. He dumped the pile of snow onto Hoseok’s head as they both collapsed onto each other, laughing. Hoseok never imagined himself almost in tears from laughing so hard, covered in snow with Grumpy Min Yoongi on top of him, but here he was.Once they calmed down a bit, Yoongi stood up, brushing the snow off of his body and offering his hand for Hoseok once again. Helping him get up, he suggested that they go get peppermint hot chocolate at a nearby concession stand. They were tired from the night’s festivities and they sat on a bench placed in front of the giant Christmas tree, with their drinks, admiring the lights for one last time as they sipped. “Thank you for inviting me out tonight.” Hoseok said to Yoongi when he noticed that he had began to get quiet again. “I had a really good time.”Yoongi smiled, looking up at at Hoseok and noticing that he still had some snow lying lightly upon his hat. “I’m glad you enjoyed it. Me too.” He gave a small smile, then he looked back down again. His mittens were off now, and his fingers nervously dug into the side of his half empty paper cup. “I haven’t been completely honest with you.” Hoseok wasn’t entirely sure about what he should do. He just looked at Yoongi with his lips pursed and his eyebrows furrowed, an expression that showed he was ready to listen. Yoongi continued. “I wasn’t embarrassed that you saw me working because of the elf costume.” Hoseoks eyes shifted as he tried to figure out what would be said next. “I was embarrassed because you found out I have to have a second job.” He felt even more confused than before. “What? Yoongi, having a second job isn’t anything to be embarrassed about.” Yoongi’s fingers gripped the cup tighter, any more and it might collapse in on itself. “No. I don’t have that job for fun, I don’t even have that job to pay for Christmas presents. I need it because I can’t afford my rent without it. That’s why I asked you for more hours at the cafe, because when Christmas is over and the North Pole display is gone I don’t know what I’m going to do.”At this point Hoseok had turned his body to better face his co-worker. He tried to look into his eyes, even though Yoongi’s were still pointed at the ground in shame. “Do--do you need help? I can help you. Jin can help you. What about your family? Do they know?” Yoongi nodded. “They don’t care. I moved to the city in October because I told them I liked men. It didn’t go well.” Lip quivering, and tears forming in his eyes, he looked at Hoseok. His voice began shaking as he went on. “They kicked me out as soon as they heard it. They threw all of my things in the front yard and changed the locks while I was at work. When I knocked on the door to talk to them, they...they told me I wasn’t their son anymore.” He was fighting back tears, his hands trembled, whether it was from the cold or from his confession was unknown. “I thought coming to the city would be good for me. That I would find someone here I could relate to, better than in my small town. I just wanted to be away.”  Hoseok took the cup Yoongi clenched, and set it down on the bench next to him. He held his recently un-mittened hands in his. Hoseok pressed his forehead against Yoongi’s and responded softly. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, Yoongi. I didn’t know.” Yoongi then leaned his head into Hoseok’s shoulder, sniffling, trying his hardest to keep his composure. Hoseok responded in the only way he knew how. He embraced Yoongi with his entire body. Holding him close and letting him feel his heartbeat. Min Yoongi was warm, he was soft, he smelled nice. Everything about hugging Yoongi felt nice. He wanted to always be close to him, he wanted to make Yoongi feel loved. Hoseok stroked Yoongi’s mint colored hair for the first time, it was soft too. He nuzzled his face in it, finding where Yoongi’s ear was and whispered to him. “Please come home with me tonight.”He did.



Chapter 6



Hoseok’s apartment only had one bedroom. Yoongi slept on the couch. Though Hoseok would have preferred lying next to his warmth throughout the night, he didn’t want to pressure him. Last night was one filled with takeout food and B-rated romance films. Two of Hoseok’s favorite things, and beside him on the couch sat what could easily become his third favorite thing. Yoongi may be sad, but he wasn’t fragile. When he talked, Hoseok could sense the strength and heartache in his voice. He listened to every word Yoongi said, hearing him talk about the things he loved, the things he hated, parts of his past that weren’t so kind to him, and parts that were. There was so much to get to know about “Grumpy Min Yoongi with no personality,” and Hoseok wanted to study all of it. He wanted every detail, every story to be a part of him too. He didn’t want Yoongi to bare anymore burdens by himself. There were so many times when Yoongi was talking, when he was laughing, that Hoseok wanted to lean forward and kiss him. But he didn’t. Eventually when things had started to quiet down, Yoongi fell asleep. Hoseok was used to quietness between them, so he didn’t notice until he felt the weight of Yoongi’s head leaning against his shoulder. He didn’t want to move him, if this could last forever he would allow it. His breathing was slow, as if he was understandably exhausted from everything that had happened to him up until now. In fact, Hoseok didn’t want to ruin the moment so badly that he started to doze off as well. He found himself nodding off, and then waking up, and repeating. Eventually his head ended up resting against Yoongi’s and he fell deeper. His slumber didn’t last long, considering the fact that using a head as a pillow wasn’t exactly the most comfortable. He decided that it was best that he made his way to his own bed. He slowly arose from the sofa, gently laying Yoongi down horizontally--who didn’t even stir. He covered him up with the blanket previously draped across the back of the cushions, turned the lights off, and climbed into his bed alone. ______________________________________________________________________________In the morning when Hoseok woke up, he found Yoongi in the same position he had left him in, still wearing Hoseok’s hoodie and sweatpants that he had lent to him last night. He looked so comfortable and peaceful, Hoseok wondered what he could be dreaming about. As quietly as possible, Hoseok began making a French press of coffee. He delicately grinded the beans in hopes that Yoongi would not be woken up, though it did take about four times longer than normal. He watched the kettle closely so that he could remove it from the stove before it had the chance to begin to whistle. He leaned against his kitchen counter, facing the open living room where the other man still slept. He slowly sipped his coffee, taking in the reality that Min Yoongi was finally more than just a strange person he had to work with. Abruptly, Yoongi jolted up, looking around frantically as if he was lost. “Is something wrong?” Hoseok worriedly asked. “I smelled the coffee, I thought I fell asleep at work!” A now alert and awake Yoongi replied, entertained by his own reaction. Hoseok chuckled. “Would you like some coffee?” “No. I don’t drink coffee.” Hoseok always found himself surprised by this man. “You work at a coffee shop but you don’t drink coffee?”Yoongi shrugged. “Well that’s like saying ‘you’re a surgeon but you don’t need surgery?’” “Okay Genius Min Yoongi. Is tea okay?” He couldn’t argue with that logic. Kicking his feet up on the sofa and bringing his knees to his chin, he responded. “Tea is good, thank you.” He watched as Hoseok made his beverage. Two months that they had worked together and Yoongi was always too wrapped up in his own work to ever watch Hoseok do his. He never knew that someone could make boiling water look like art. Hoseok delivered the steaming cup to Yoongi, who then patted the open spot next to him. Signaling Hoseok to sit down next to him. “Thanks for letting me stay here, and thanks for letting me wear your clothes.” “It’s no problem. We work together today right? You’re welcome to stay here until then. You can borrow more of my clothes.” Yoongi responded by smiling and nodding at the idea. He liked Hoseok’s clothes. Not only because they were nice, but also because they smelled like Hoseok. That made them even more nice.______________________________________________________________________________They entered the cafe at the same time together. Much to Jin’s surprise, who was currently working behind the counter. What even made him more surprised was that Yoongi donned an outfit that Jin and certainly seen before, only not on Yoongi. He wasn’t about to let any gossip get past him. “Yoongi, could you please go into the back and do an inventory of the plastic utensils for me?” Yoongi gladly headed past the heavy swinging doors and into the back room. Jin watched from the corner of his eyes to make sure he was out of earshot. Then he turned to Hoseok. “Well well, well. I see the Christmas light date went well.”Hoseok looked up from tying his apron. “How do you know about the Christmas lights?”“I was the one that gave him the tickets.” He replied with a wink. “Jin!” Hoseok tried his hardest to yell and whisper at the same time. “I just wanted him to have a little fun. I hate seeing him so morose all the time. Namjoon is out of town anyway so it’s not like they were any good to me. But what’s with the clothes? Did you guys...uh-”Hoseok quickly interjected. “No! It’s not like that. It’s not like that at all. We talked a lot, he slept over, on the couch. I got to know him.” “Good. I’m glad.” Jin managed to say before Yoongi bursted through the large doors, eagerly reporting that there were currently three boxes of spoons, five of forks, and eight of knives. Hoseok knew he had to bring up Yoongi’s situation to Jin soon, in hopes that he could help him get a raise before Christmas. He was positive that Jin wouldn’t falter to help him out.  ___________________________________________________________________________The end of their shift came sooner than they hoped. Hoseok thought this would be a great time to bring up the cafe Christmas party next week. Still a no from Yoongi. Maybe things would change in a week.Before they parted ways, Yoongi thanked him again for his hospitality and told him that he would wash and return his clothes to him tomorrow. Back at his apartment, Hoseok sat down on the couch he now had to himself. Scrolling through his messages and responding accordingly (mostly to Tae), he felt a small headache arising from the back of his head. He pinched his forehead and wrinkled his nose at the annoyance. Leaning back and looking around the room, he realized it was too barren for this time of year. Luckily he had a solution in mind. He pulled up his messaging app and began typing to Yoongi. “My apartment has no decorations. Come over tomorrow morning and we can go shopping for stuff and make it a little more festive in here?” The response was almost immediate. “Yes!”



Chapter 7



“Good morning!” Hoseok yelled upon opening the door and finding Yoongi. The truth was, he wasn’t surprised at all. As a matter-of-fact Hoseok had been waiting not-so-patiently for the knocks on the door to signal that the person he wanted to see the most had arrived. It was early, they were both used to it. Working at a cafe had diminished their ability to sleep in very late these days. Even so, Hoseok found himself abnormally tired. It was okay though--today is an important day. Knowing Yoongi, Hoseok assumed he hadn’t eaten today. So he prepared some pancakes and had them sitting on the table waiting to be enjoyed. Yoongi’s eyes lit up when he saw what was waiting for him. He usually wasn’t one to eat much in the mornings, but there was no way he could resist pancakes.They sat down at the table across from each other. Yoongi devoured his quickly and in silence, but Hoseok found it difficult to swallow more than two bites. He chalked it up to feeling far too excited to decorate with his crush. “We should get going then!” Hoseok remarked when he noticed that Yoongi had finished everything in front of him. There was no objection, and they began their journey to the shop.It was frigid outside, so cold even, snowflakes were falling on the two of them. Hoseok was shivering. He couldn’t recall the last time he had felt this cold. It was like his bones were made of ice and were forcing him to freeze from the inside out. Yoongi must have noticed, because he removed his scarf and wrapped it around Hoseok’s neck. But he protested. “No. I don’t want you to be cold because I came unprepared.” Yoongi shook his head. “You’re always more cold than I am. I think I have to hold your hand again.” Soon Hoseok’s hand was met with Yoongi’s again. As much as he enjoyed the touch, he didn’t exactly feel any warmer. He started to wonder if walking was a mistake. Maybe they should have called a taxi to take them. Turning back around wasn’t unreasonable. Hoseok turned his head to see how far they had made it. His apartment building was still in plain sight. They must have only been walking for a couple of minutes. The action of facing forward again projected Hoseok into a bout of dizziness. Something wasn’t right. This has never happened before. He almost lost his balance. Yoongi held tightly onto the other man’s arm. “Are you okay?” He asked, his grip tightening. “I really don’t feel good.” Hoseok replied, his body became more slack, relying entirely on Yoongi to keep him up. Yoongi felt Hoseok’s forehead with his hand. Way too warm for this climate and way too warm for him to be shivering the way he was. He figured that it must be his fault for dumping so much snow on Hoseok the other night. They weren’t far from the apartment. Yoongi could easily carry him back. And so he lifted him up. One arm under his back and one arm under his legs. Hoseok felt lifeless in his arms. He curled up to Yoongi, resting his burning face into the crook of the other man’s neck. It may have been odd to onlookers to see a grown and colorful haired man carrying another grown man down the street bridal style, but Yoongi didn’t care. He only wanted to get Hoseok back into the comfort of his bed. Going up the stairs proved to be a challenge. At first, Yoongi hesitated to start walking up the steps, knowing that he could fall backwards and that would put them in an even worse predicament. So he hoisted Hoseok up and draped him over his shoulder. This action earned a gripe from Hoseok. “I can walk.” He mumbled from behind Yoongi’s shoulder. “No need.” Yoongi continued up the stairs. Breathless, he finally made it to Hoseok’s apartment door. He dug carefully into Hoseok’s back pocket searching for the key, he expected another complaint, but there was only silence. Finally making it into the apartment, Yoongi carried Hoseok to his bedroom, and flopped him on the bed. It was less gentle than Yoongi had hoped, but it  got the job done. He began to tuck Hoseok into the blanket that was found on his bed. He noticed that he was still shivering, so he took the blanket from the sofa as well and lied it down softly on top. Yoongi briskly pushed the blanket around Hoseok’s body, making sure that none of his body heat could be lost. He felt his forehead again, even warmer than before. Though Hoseok still trembled, Yoongi placed a cool washcloth on his forehead in hopes it would help diminish his fever.Hoseok laid unconscious, his breathing was slow, but he still had the chills. Yoongi watched him and waited to see if he seemed to get warmer, but he didn’t. So he decided to search the house for more blankets. He looked in every cabinet, every closet, and under every piece of furniture of the small apartment in hopes that he would find something else to bundle Hoseok in. Not a single thing was found.He returned to the bedroom, considering tapping on Hoseok’s shoulder and asking him if he had any blankets hidden anywhere. But he decided it was best to let him sleep. Instead, Yoongi did the only other thing he could think to do. He climbed in the bed next to Hoseok and snuggled his body as close to him as possible. He wrapped his arms and legs around his body and kept his head on Hoseok’s shoulder. Hoping that he would transfer as much warmth as he could. He laid unmoving until he felt Hoseok grow still once again. Part of him selfishly wished that Hoseok was still cold, because he didn’t want to leave his side. But he was pleased to see that his efforts seemed to help.Yoongi snuck softy out of the bed. He gathered a glass of water and what small snacks he could find to leave at Hoseok’s bedside if he awoke. Then, he grabbed his coat and left the apartment. _____________________________________________________________________________For the following hours, Hoseok was plagued by fever dreams. He could have sworn earlier that a giant cat was lying next to him. Everything that was happening to him felt so surreal. He couldn’t figure out if the room was spinning because of the sickness ravaging his body, or he was stuck twirling inside of a black hole. Each visual of the nightmares looked like a world of melted crayons.He could feel his eyes flutter open sometimes as he tried to take in his surroundings. He was alone in his bedroom. Knowing that would quell his worries long enough to fall back asleep.There was no way he could know what time it was, but by looking at the window he could see that it was dark outside. Sometimes he would think he heard loud crashing sounds, sometimes they sounded like glass breaking, sometimes it sounded like someone was shuffling an elephant through the living room, and sometimes he thought he heard a voice. He wanted desperately to message Yoongi and ask him to come over. But he couldn’t muster the strength to unwrap himself from his blankets. He felt himself slowly slipping into unconsciousness once again._____________________________________________________________________________The sun shone through the frost covered windows and beamed onto Hoseok’s face. He woke up, feeling much better than he did previously. Looking around, he smiled when spotted the cup of water and food that Yoongi had left for him. He wondered how long he had been asleep. Surely it couldn’t have been that long, maybe a few hours at most. He stood up, no more signs of dizziness.  Opening the door of his bedroom he was greeted with a red and green paper chain hanging from the doorway. He moved it to the side with his hand and was shocked by the view in front of him.Paper snowflakes dangled from the ceiling, stockings hung under the living room window, candy canes were scattered around the table, colorful lights were strung in every direction. But most importantly, a fully decorated and bright Christmas tree stood in the corner of the room. He made his way slowly over, wondering what had happened while he was napping. Did Jin organize this? He gets lonely when Namjoon is on his business trips, but not this lonely. Reaching the tree he saw his answer, there under the lowest branches; lying much too comfortably on the floor, was a sleeping Min Yoongi.Hoseok gently shook him to wake him up.  When Yoongi lifted his head and opened his eyes, he smiled. “Are you feeling better?” He asked.“Much better...but how long was I sleeping? How did you do all of this?”“About 24 hours. And I know you wanted to decorate, but you got sick, so I did it myself. You learn a lot when you work at the North Pole.” Yoongi stretched as he picked himself up off of the ground. Pulling a few pine needles from his hair, he continued. “Oh. I moved your sofa over, hope you don’t mind. And I did accidentally knock the tree over once, and maybe a few ornaments broke. It was my first time putting up a tree on my own.” He laughed nervously. Hoseok couldn’t stop admiring all the work he had put into the decor. “You bought all of this, and you did all of this by yourself?”“Yep.” Knowing Yoongi’s current situation, Hoseok couldn’t help but feel guilty. He worried he would never be able to show how much he appreciated this. He turned to Yoongi, embracing him again. Just like a few nights ago, but this time it was happy. He squeezed the other man as tightly as he possibly could. “Thank you so much. Let’s make this Christmas one we’ll always remember.” Yoongi hugged back. Matching Hoseok’s strength. He replied, “Well, we still have one more week, so how could it possibly get more memorable than this?”  He only left Hoseok wondering what he meant for a second.Finishing his sentence, he pulled back a bit from their hug. He then quickly and briefly kissed Hoseok on the lips. Warmth rushed to his face as he worried if he made too bold of a move. No move was too bold for Jung Hoseok, especially when it came to Yoongi. Hoseok leaned his face in close to Yoongi’s, still not breaking their embrace. His lips hovered over the other’s and he kissed him back. Only instead of quick and brief, he kissed him slower. Everything about Min Yoongi was soft, his hair was soft, his skin was soft, and even the way he kissed was soft. Yoongi could feel the warmth in his face diminish as it trickled down to his chest. His heart felt as if it would burst. Hoseok pulled away from the kiss, but their foreheads remained touching. In a low and husky voice, Hoseok finally answered the question. “I’m sure I’ll think of something."



Chapter 8



The next two days went by smoothly, though it was a short time, it felt long. They worked together, flirting their way through their shifts. Sometimes, earning a scolding from Jin if they weren’t focused enough. When they weren’t working they spent time at Hoseok’s apartment. They ate their meals together, and they spent many hours cuddling on the couch. When it was time to sleep, Yoongi always went back to his own place. Hoseok’s desire for Yoongi to sleep by his side hadn’t diminished, but he didn’t think it was best to bring it up first. Yoongi liked to take things slowly, and if that’s what Yoongi liked to do, Hoseok liked it too. There were so many things that Hoseok wanted to do with him. But if Yoongi only wanted to hold hands and lightly peck Hoseok on the cheek periodically for the rest of their lives, he would be okay with that too. When Yoongi left, Hoseok would call Tae, filling him in on everything that happened between the two of them. “So...what are you guys?” He asked. Hoseok wondered too. The third day went well too. Jin called a staff meeting early in the morning. Hoseok was under the impression that they would be given a speech about appropriate relationships in the workplace, and when to hide displays of affection. Maybe Hoseok shouldn’t have kissed the back of Yoongi’s head while he made a latte. But it was too difficult to resist. The entire staff (which included Jimin, Hoseok, Yoongi, and the part-timer, Jungkook) sat at a large makeshift table Jin had made pushing four small cafe tables together. Jin emerged from the back room of the cafe, his apron covered in flour from his early morning baking. Being in the cafe this early wasn’t unusual for him. However, the other staff members felt differently. They tried to rub the  obvious signs of sleepiness out of their eyes before Jin reached their location. He stood in front of them with his arms crossed, looking tense. He began to speak, scanning the room. “I’m sure you know why I gathered you all here.” Hoseok shyly nodded his head, bracing himself for what he may hear next. Jin continued. “As you all should be aware, my Christmas party is on the 25th. That is exactly four days from now. I still haven’t received RSVPs from some of you.” He looked over each of the employees, trying not to make it obvious that Yoongi was the only one who hadn’t responded to the invitation.Hoseok sighed in relief. Sitting next to him, Jungkook groaned. “Did you really call us here at 4 in the morning see if we were attending your party?”  “How do you expect me to know how many h'oeuvres d'oeuvres to make if I don’t even know who will be there?”  Jungkook interjected. “There’s only four of us.”Realizing what exactly was going on , and why Jin was doing it, Hoseok swiftly stepped on the foot of the youngest employee to silence him.   Jin continued once again. “So, I need a verbal confirmation or denial right now.” Starting at Jimin, the four employees started to state their plans of attendance. First Jimin, who said yes of course. Jungkook, who surprisingly yet sleepily also agreed to attend. Hoseok, who (much too excitedly for the time of day) complied. And last was Yoongi, whose eyes shifted somewhat nervously at those around him, but lingering the longest on Hoseok. He then gave a small nod. Jin clapped his hands together and announced his excitement for the party, reminding everyone to dress warmly and encouraged them to bring along whatever they wanted.
______________________________________________________________________________It was certain the third day went well, their work day continued on as normal, and Hoseok and Yoongi said their goodbyes at the end of their shift as Yoongi went on to his second job. The third night however, went differently.
Hoseok slumbered peacefully in his own bed, alone, as usual. He dreamed of arbitrary things, dinosaurs, flying cats, and for some reason Yoongi was there. Dreaming about him wasn’t so arbitrary. It was nice to have entire days filled with Yoongi’s laugh, with his smile, with his soft hands. Soon he found himself awake. A little confused, he looked around in the darkness. His phone read 2:11 AM. Just as he began to settle back into the warmth of his blankets, he heard knocking on his front door. It must have been what woke him up in the first place.Groggily and dubiously, Hoseok made his way to his front door. It’s very unusual for someone to visit him at this hour--in fact it has never happened. He peered through the peephole to confirm that it was safe to open. He caught a glimpse of the mint hair he had grown so accustomed to. The door briskly opened, and there Yoongi stood. Only this time he wasn’t laughing or smiling. He was crying, his cheeks were red and raw, freshly dropped tears still glistening on his face. “I’m sorry.” Was the only thing he could manage to say before being succumbing to his sobs. Hoseok couldn’t find the words to say. He had never seen him cry before, he came close that night after their snowball fight, but nothing like this. He pulled Yoongi inside and closed the door. He held him close. Closer than he thought was possible. He thumbed through Yoongi’s hair, shushing him and gently placing kisses on his forehead. Yoongi would try to talk, but he couldn’t get many words out. “I regret it so much.” Hoseok was tempted to make another joke and say, “the Christmas party won’t be that bad,” but maybe now wasn’t the time for that. Instead he simply asked, “what do you regret?”The question only earned more sobs into Hoseok’s shoulder. He was inconsolable, and there was no telling how long this could last, but Hoseok didn’t mind cosseting him as long as he needed. It must have only been 10 minutes, but it felt like they had been standing in their position for an hour. Hoseok’s shoulder began to fall asleep, but he didn’t want to say anything. Slowly, Yoongi calmed down. The air was still for the first time since he arrived. Hoseok loosed his grip a bit, warmly rubbing Yoongi’s arm, cleared his throat, and spoke softly. “Let’s go for a walk.” ______________________________________________________________________________The snow had fallen earlier that night. Luckily, Hoseok had enough sense to put real clothing on instead of his pajamas. So they walked down the street, hand in hand,  at almost 3 in the morning, with only a few street lights to illuminate their path.Their walk was silent. Yoongi didn’t want to talk and Hoseok didn’t know what to say. Finally, they reached an empty park. Hoseok lead Yoongi to the swings and they sat down , both men slightly rocking in their own suspended seats. Hoseok sighed a little, seeing his breath in the frigid air. “Are you okay?” He asked.He watched as Yoongi simply nodded. His lies were easy to see through. “Talk to me.” Hoseok said, somewhat more stern sounding than he intended. Yoongi took a deep breath, looking up as he wondered how he could begin. “It’s hard, this time of year. It’s the first time on my own. I miss my parents. I miss my mom’s cooking, I miss my dad’s stories, I miss everything. I can’t go home, they don’t love me anymore. They don’t want me there.” His voice cracked as if he would start to cry again. Hoseok reached over and grabbed his hand to comfort him. Yoongi paused a bit, but then went on. “I wish I never came out to them. I should have never told them. If I didn’t, everything would be okay. I feel so alone, I’m scared. I wasn’t ready...I wasn’t ready for this.” Hoseok watched as Yoongi wiped away tears with his free hand. He still felt a loss for words. He wanted to tell Yoongi that he loved him, and that he would always be there to support him. But maybe now wasn’t the time for that either. It hurt him to see Yoongi so distressed. “Whatever happens...things will get better. I know it doesn’t seem like it right now...and maybe it won’t seem like it in a year. But you can get through it. Your family might come around...even if they don’t, it’ll be okay. A different kind of okay, but it’ll be okay.” Yoongi’s hand squeezed Hoseok’s as he looked down, tears falling into the snow beneath him. Hoseok added one final thought. “Please don’t feel alone. You’re never alone.” Yoongi nodded, and said a quiet “thank you.” Feeling humiliated at his current emotional state, Yoongi released his hand from Hoseok’s and buried his face in his own. They sat in silence again as Yoongi gathered himself. Hoseok reached over to tenderly rub his upper back. Yoongi spoke again. “I’m so sorry about waking you up this late. I feel terrible. I didn’t know what to do.”Before he could apologize anymore, Hoseok interrupted. “Don’t feel bad. I don’t mind at all. If you need anything...please, by all means please come to me.” Yoongi smiled at him. A smile that made it easy to forget how sad he was just a few minutes ago.  Yoongi’s mind was at ease as he looked up at the stars shining brightly above them. He took in the scene of the vast night sky, thinking about how expansive it was. The same sky he was born under, the same sky cried under, and the same sky that he met Hoseok under. “The stars are beautiful.” He said, not breaking his gaze. Hoseok was transfixed on Yoongi, he couldn’t look at the sky even if Santa himself was flying across. He scanned every feature, his cheekbones, the way his nose sat perfectly on his face, the curve of his lips. He loved the man sitting next to him at three in the morning in the snow. Hoseok replied, watching as the moonlight shone on Yoongi’s delicate face. 

“Yeah, they really are.”

So, maybe the third night didn’t end so badly. What began as an unexpected and somewhat distressing visit from Min Yoongi ended as something Hoseok only thought he would dream of. Upon realizing they only had 2 and a half hours until they both had to be at work, Hoseok invited Yoongi to come back to his apartment to try to get some sleep. He still didn’t know where Yoongi lived, he didn’t want to ask, but he worried it was too far for Yoongi to get adequate rest. When they entered the warm apartment, Hoseok offered Yoongi the couch. “Can I come with you?” Was Yoongi’s response to the proposal. Hoseok wasn’t expecting it, he should be used to the way Yoongi did things by now, but he wasn’t. “Of course.” He responded, nervous for some reason.  Hoseok handed Yoongi the same pair of sweatpants and hoodie that he slept in during their first night under the same roof. He joked that Yoongi should just keep them, as he gets more use out of them than Hoseok does. __________________________________________________________________________In Hoseok’s happily occupied bed, they were spooning. Hoseok’s arms were wrapped around Yoongi’s torso. He could feel as his body rose and lowered again with each breath. Hoseok, however, was wide awake, trying to suppress his increasing heart rate. How embarrassing. It appeared that to Yoongi, that snuggling was natural and calming. Hoseok, on the other hand felt more awake than he would if he drank 4 shots of espresso. Yoongi started to stir in his sleep. He turned around so that he was facing Hoseok. His eyes were closed, he looked so peaceful. Hoseok decided to close his as well, in case Yoongi happened to see him wide awake.A small voice rose from the mint-haired man. “Are you sleeping?” He asked.Hoseok didn’t know what to do. Does he pretend he was? Should he just be honest?He decided that being honest was the best. “No. No I’m not sleeping.”“Neither am I.” Yoongi replied, his eyes remaining closed. He then moved closer to Hoseok, and began kissing him lightly, tracing his jawline. He moved to his lips, Hoseok didn’t hesitate to kiss back, not even for a second. He kissed his neck, unlocking Hoseok’s weakness. The arousal between the two of them increased. In fact, it increased to the point that eventually Yoongi was whispering low curses and soft moans into Hoseok’s ear. Hoseok was right when he believed that Yoongi took things slow, even when it came to pleasuring his partners. Hoseok had Yoongi in every way he could have imagined him tonight, and that definitely included being pinned under him while wearing nothing.  Luckily, their climaxes arrived shortly before Hoseok’s alarm shrieked, an unpleasant reminder that they had to make it through an entire work day.  Yoongi rolled back to his side with a groan, Hoseok remained in his position, exasperated. His hands covering his face as he breathed heavily, trying to catch his breath from the events of the last two hours. “I hope you’re ready to make lattes all day.” Yoongi leaned back towards Hoseok, eyes meeting his and locking. In a husky low voice, he spoke. “And I hope you’re ready to think about what I just did to you all day.” Hoseok felt his stomach drop. He definitely would be thinking about that all day, and for many days to come. Probably even for the rest of his life._____________________________________________________________________They arrived at the cafe together, Yoongi sporting clothes that didn’t belong to him once again.Jin looked up briefly from behind the pastry case he was stocking with tree shaped brownies and cupcakes that resembled snowballs. “Morning. You’re late.” “Grumpyyyyyyy.” Hoseok teased as he entered the area behind the counter, ruffling Jin’s hair. “Namjoon got home late last night from his business trip. I’ll let you draw your own conclusions.” Jin responded, not looking up from his precise work. Hoseok looked over his shoulder, making sure Yoongi was still retrieving the beans from the storage room. “I didn’t get much sleep either.” Jin always loved to hear about the workplace gossip, but it he didn’t seem so engaged this particular moment. He hummed lightly in acknowledgement. “So it seems.”Untying his apron and hanging it behind him, he patted Hoseok on the shoulder and said goodbye for the day. Hoseok had hoped Jin would be excited for him, he was dying to tell someone about what had happened. He always had a hard time keeping things to himself, even things that should be kept private for the sake of all the parties involved.As a result, he ended up video calling Taehyung outside during his lunch break. “Oh please, save me the gory details, Hoseok.” Taehyung groaned. Not the type of reaction Hoseok was hoping for. Hoseok was practically yelling at the screen in front of him. “There are no gory details! It was nice. His d-” Suddenly Taehyung emitted a deep, animalistic sound that Hoseok had never had the displeasure of hearing before. He looked at Taehyung’s face on the screen and noticed his eyebrows furrowed and his nostrils flared. In the upper corner, where Hoseok could see a tiny version of himself, he noticed Yoongi approaching behind him. He didn’t bother finishing his sentence. “Hey, what are you guys talking about?” Yoongi asked as he placed a snowball cupcake on the table in front of Hoseok. He waved at the far-away Taehyung. Flustered, both of the men tried to answer. Simultaneously, they shouted out. “DOGS-”“SPIDERS-”“Ooooookaaaay.” Yoongi kissed the top of Hoseok’s head before backing away and returning to the indoors for work. “Tae...spiders? Really?” Hoseok questioned, shaking his head.____________________________________________________________________When Hoseok returned to his shift, Yoongi informed him that he wouldn’t be able to hang out after work today. The thought crossed Hoseok’s mind that perhaps Yoongi heard more of the video call than he had hoped. Maybe he felt uncomfortable and wanted to stay away again, though his contented demeanor suggested otherwise. But the next day Yoongi did the same...and the next day. They worked together, Yoongi seemed happy, but he didn’t want to see Hoseok outside of the cafe. Hoseok overthought all of the possibilities in his head. Christmas was only two days away at this point. It was almost guaranteed that Yoongi would be busy with his other job. Hoseok expressed his worries to a finally well-rested Jin, who reassured him that Yoongi would be attending the Christmas party, and that he had nothing to worry about. As much as he wanted to believe the words Jin said, he was still unsure. Certainly their feelings were mutual, right? They had to be. Afterall, it was Yoongi who initiated what happened in Hoseok’s bed that night. He knew Yoongi to be a master at avoiding people, and avoiding things he didn’t want to do.Hoseok desperately hoped that he hadn’t become one of those things.



Chapter End Notes
I apologize for such a short update. Just letting you guys know that I think this fic will have most likely two more chapters. And that I'll be wrapping it up here in the next couple of days. Thanks for reading this far :) This is pretty much the second thing I've written in my life. So, I appreciate you guys so much!


Chapter 10



“Secret Santa assignments!” Jin exuberantly yelled to the employees as he busted through the heavy doors, covered in flour again. Only this time his look was topped off with a reindeer antlers headband.
The group of younger men looked up at him, sitting in the same formation that they had been in during the previous early morning meeting. It felt like deja vu, Jungkook groaned in the same tone as before. “But there are only four of us.” Jin didn’t look up from his list.  “First off, there are six of us. And second...the pairings are: Jimin and Namjoon, Jungkook and me, and Yoongi and Hoseok.”“Yoongi and Hoseok? Seems a little rigged.” Jimin half-jested as he leaned forward in his seat, laughing as he spoke. 

Jungkook chimed in. "And it's not so secret when you tell all of us who we're shopping for."Conveniently, Jin stood behind them as if he expected off-handed comments from his two youngest employees, and lightly smacked the back of both of their heads with the papers he was holding. As irritating as Jin could be...like calling them in early in the morning to ask them something as simple as if they would be attending his small party instead of just sending them a message, his employees unconditionally loved him. On the surface, Jin’s Christmas parties may seem to be thrown for selfish reasons. But the truth was, Jin only has his Christmas parties to make sure that each year, his employees wouldn’t be spending Christmas alone. He understood that they were all young, they were far from home, some couldn’t go back for various reasons. So he hoped he could make them feel at least a little bit at home. Even though some of them didn’t seem very appreciative at times, he always knew that his efforts weren’t wasted.  ______________________________________________________________________________In his bed, at 2 in the morning, Hoseok sat up wide awake. Anxiety was fighting his sleepiness and coming out victorious. Earlier in the week, Yoongi was knocking on his door at this time. The entire situation was confusing; Yoongi acted normal at work, he seemed excited to be around Hoseok, but he refused--very admantely each time--that he couldn’t see him after work. The last thing that Hoseok wanted to be was clingy, but knowing Yoongi’s track record of avoidance, he was left only to wonder if he had done something wrong. Jin assured him numerous times that he was simply overthinking things. Jin knew Hoseok well and could easily tell when his worries had taken control over his perception of reality. But for some reason he didn’t feel convinced. He knew that Yoongi most likely wouldn’t talk about whatever was bothering him on his own, so Hoseok wondered if he should press him for it again. But Hoseok felt like he was always prying Yoongi for what was wrong. It is how their relationship started after all. What was their relationship anyway? Are they simply friends who had one night fueled with intensely confused emotions that led to a hookup? Or did Yoongi legitimately want to be with Hoseok and had a hard time expressing himself? He does like men after all, no doubt about that. But maybe Yoongi was just testing the waters and learned Hoseok wasn’t the one for him after they had sex.Whatever the reason, Hoseok remained undecided about whether he should message Yoongi. Sometimes he would type out a sentence, sometimes it would be a paragraph, but he always ended up deleting it.He stared up at the ceiling. Hoping somehow he could find an answer in it. His phone buzzed on the pillow beside him. 
 New Message from: 
TaeTae: DO NOT MESSAGE HIM!!!!As expected, Hoseok had his hopes up that Taehyung would be asleep and wouldn’t be the one making his phone go off. But he should have known, Taehyung is mysteriously awake at all hours. Since he moved away he sort of became omnipotent, there hasn’t been a single time Taehyung has not almost immediately answered Hoseok’s calls or texts. He was always thankful for that, even if it did seem a little strange at times.As much as he liked to take Taehyung’s advice, and as much as he did trust his best friend, this time he didn’t listen. He could only think of the question that Taehyung had asked him a few days prior.
 Compose message>> 
To: Min Yoongi: So...what are we? Sent. Immediate regret. As Hoseok waited for a response he realized that Yoongi probably wasn’t awake and that he wouldn’t see his message until they were meant to work together. He began to cringe himself deep into his mattress. What’s done was done. The only thing he could do was sleep and hope that there would be a response in a couple hours. _______________________________________________________________________The morning alarm sounded again. No response from Yoongi. He hadn’t even read it. Hoseok knew what he had to do, and it certainly wasn’t awkwardly facing Yoongi today. “Hello?” Jin’s sing-song voice echoed through the phone.“Hey Jin, I need to take the day off today. I’m not feeling great.”Jin never was easily fooled. “Okay. I know that’s a lie but I can assume you did something to embarrass yourself so I’ll accept it.” “Thanks Jinnie.” He was about to hang up when he heard Jin quickly get his last words in.“Trust me. You have NOTHING to worry about.” And with that, the call ended.The Christmas party was tomorrow night anyway, and Hoseok was assigned to Yoongi as his ‘Secret Santa’...but, what did Yoongi like? After Yoongi avoided Hoseok the first time, and before he started avoiding him this time, he would spend part of their breaks together showing Hoseok pictures of dogs on his phone, but most frequently of a small brown poodle. So he thought that maybe he should get him something related to dogs.
Hoseok was crossing the street when his phone vibrated in his pocket. Probably Tae again, making sure that Hoseok didn’t send any stupid messages. He took his phone out just to confirm.
 New Message from:
Min Yoongi No way. Hoseok stopped in his tracks, despite being in the middle of the crosswalk. It was only the abrupt sound from a car horn that brought him back to reality. Quickly walking to the safety of the sidewalk, he opened his message upon arrival.  Min Yoongi: We’re people? :P
Just kidding. What do you mean? Min Yoongi:  Missing you today. Merry Christmas Eve! Hoseok felt relieved, even though his question remained unanswered. He didn’t need an answer though, not today. Yoongi missed him, it was obvious he liked him. He should have listened to Jin and Taehyung.Hoseok replied:Sorry I sleep texted. Lol!! I meant to say what are we doing tomorrow at work? Inventory?
Merry Christmas Eve too! :)Hoseok very well knew that the cafe was closed tomorrow.
Yoongi’s reply came quickly. Min Yoongi: What are you, stupid?? Closed tomorrow, xmas party at Jin’s at night. hahahahaha.Hoseok smiled, he didn’t know if Yoongi saw through him, but he was happy that he easily let it go. He was also smiling for the fact that Yoongi still hadn’t backed out of his plans to attend the party. In fact, he seemed happy. _____________________________________________________________________________Shopping took awhile, but he was glad that Taehyung wasn’t around this time to make it take even longer. Hoseok worried that he wouldn’t be able to find a good gift for Yoongi. What he really wanted to give him were his entire feelings spewed out at once, but that may not be very appropriate for a Christmas party. Finally, his eyes laid upon the most beautiful sight he had ever seen (other than Yoongi’s face). A green knitted sweater hung on the clothing rack placed in front of him as if it was destiny. In the middle was a picture of a small brown poodle wearing a Santa hat, also knitted, and framed by a small string of lights. As he got closer, he noticed a sticker near the dog’s nose that said “press here,” and so he did. The lights on the sweater lit up. It was perfect. Yoongi would love it.



Final
Chapter Notes

        See the end of the chapter for  notes




December 25th. The day everyone had anxiously awaited for different reasons had finally arrived.
Hoseok finished combing his hair, adjusting the part on his forehead. He admired the way he looked wearing his button up shirt and red bowtie in the full length mirror that stood near the doorway before exiting his bedroom.
Walking into the living room, he reminisced on the day Yoongi set up the Christmas tree himself while Hoseok was sleeping off a fever. His hand grazed over the sofa where Yoongi had slept and spent hours cuddled up against him. He smiled. Whatever the reason Yoongi was acting distant, he was sure it was a good one. He knew Yoongi struggled with money, it was no secret he would be embarrassed to admit that he had to work extra hours as an elf to be able to afford Hoseok’s Christmas present.
A pang of guilt surged through Hoseok’s chest at the thought of Yoongi overworking himself to try to make Hoseok happy. He hoped he knew that he didn’t have to buy him anything expensive--or anything at all--to make him happy. He also hoped Jin paired them up for a reason.He picked up Yoongi’s neatly wrapped sweater and left the hospitality of his apartment, being greeted into the snow as the sun was setting.  It was almost completely dark by the time he got to the property. Namjoon and Jin’s income combined allowed them to buy their own house, on their own plot of land, instead of an apartment like the other employees. It was a nice change of scenery. It almost felt like being in the countryside despite being just outside city limits. The sky seemed more clear, the air seemed more crisp, and the snow sparkled even more under the unskewed starlight. The backyard was lined with trees, leaving no indication that there was another house next to them. Hoseok knocked on the door. A joyful “Come in!” sounded from the other side. Light poured out and onto the doorstep as Hoseok opened the door. He stepped into the cozy air that smelled of cinnamon and pine. Small appetizers were spread along the table, a large cake sat in the middle. Garland and lights hung at every edge of the tall ceiling. In the center of the room sat the largest Christmas tree any of them had probably ever seen, adorned with what seemed like hundreds of shiny decorations. Music played to fill the atmosphere, but was drowned out by the laughter shared amongst everyone present. Jimin ran to Hoseok, exclaiming a drawn out version of his name. He jumped onto the taller man and hugged him to further communicate his excitement. Jungkook followed suit, only in a more calm manner and hugged him as well. Behind the table he noticed Jin  holding a sprig of mistletoe over Namjoon and trying his best to kiss him, only to be gently pushed away by Namjoon, who was laughing much to hard to kiss anyone anyway. “Welcome back Hoseok!” Namjoon announced when he noticed the man standing surrounded by Jimin and Jungkook. Hoseok scanned the room, no signs of Yoongi. He thought it would be smart to ask as Jin approached him, sipping a glass of eggnog. “Any word from Yoongi?” Jin responded as he reached forward to take the gift Hoseok held. “Oh, he’ll be here. No worries.” Hopefully. The time passed slowly, but the party was fun, even though it was just the five of them. Jin was the only one who had seen Namjoon in awhile, so their conversations consisted of catching up with the details of their lives. It was nice to be in such a relaxed atmosphere. Since Yoongi started working at the cafe, Hoseok didn’t have as many chances to work with Jungkook, so he was thankful for the time he got to spend with him again. They sat in a circle on the furniture that must have cost more than Hoseok’s entire wardrobe, making jokes and telling stories. Suddenly, the front door burst open, a rush of cold air pouring in. Yoongi stood breathing heavily in the doorway, wearing the same outfit he wore on the night he saw Christmas lights with Hoseok, only this time he wore the elf hat from his North Pole uniform. He had rushed from his final shift, ensuring that he would make it in a reasonable amount of time. “Did you run all the way here?” Jin asked, looking surprised.“Yes, I didn’t want to keep you waiting.” The smaller man said between breaths. “Hoseok’s boyfriend!” Jungkook shouted from the back of the room. Yoongi blushed as he tried to avoid eye contact with anyone, pulling off his elf hat and sprinkling snow on the ground. Hoseok jumped up quickly and waved his hands in a “no” gesture while he shook his head. “No...no…it’s not..” He slowly walked to his not-boyfriend, trying to stammer out a denial for the sake of Yoongi. But his attempt was futile. Yoongi pulled Hoseok into him and kissed the side of his head. In front of the entire staff of the cafe. It quickly shut Hoseok up. But when he looked over to the group, no one seemed to have noticed. Or they were pretending not to. Jin was the only one who didn’t try to hide. Instead, he took another sip from his glass, wiggling his eyebrows when he and Hoseok locked eyes.Yoongi revealed a small wrapped package that was stuffed into his coat. The tag read Hoseok’s name, and he placed it under the tree. Namjoon clapped his hands together once. “So! Now that everyone’s here, let’s get everything started!” He walked over to the fireplace and pressed a button, starting a fire on the logs that sat waiting to be warmed. Above it, and away from the reach of the fire, hung six stockings that were personalized for each person. Jin walked to the small bar off to the side and pulled out glasses for everyone, offering his collection of alcohol to be drunk freely. Finishing his duty, he walked briskly to Yoongi, who was admiring the impressive reflectiveness of the glass ornaments. “Can I see you in the kitchen please?” Jin whispered as he barely stopped walking long enough for Yoongi to register who it was.Apprehensive, he looked around his shoulder to Hoseok, who only shrugged. So he followed Jin to the kitchen, unsure of what would happen next. When Yoongi walked into the doorway of the very large and marbled countered kitchen, Jin was reaching into tall cabinets and pulling out plates. Surely he wasn’t asking for to help to reach them, as he was taller than Yoongi. “Yoongi! I wanted to give you a gift a little different than the others. I’m sure you’ve noticed the stockings. But...uh...you get something extra.” Yoongi remained silent, intently listening for what Jin would say next. “I’d like to give you a raise. Your work at the cafe has been really appreciated and needed these past three months. You’ve excelled in everything. And...here…” Jin opened one of the drawers and pulled out a red envelope. “Please open it.” Inside the envelope was a Christmas card, just a generic one with a reindeer that could apply to anyone. But he opened the card and revealed a check for $1000. Yoongi gasped silently, he looked up at Jin, unsure of what to say. There was no way he could accept a gift like this. Before he could start to object, Jin spoke again. “I know things have been hard. You deserve this. Merry Christmas.” He somewhat-awkwardly pulled Yoongi into an embrace, unsure if he was making the right choice of actions. Yoongi responded by wrapping his arms around Jin’s torso, melting into the hug. This was the second person that had done such a thing since Yoongi moved to the city. It felt so nice. Hugging Jin felt much different from Hoseok, but equally as comforting. “Thank you so much. I don’t know how to--”Jin patted Yoongi’s shoulder. “You don’t have to do anything. Thank you for your hard work.” Their hug ended, Yoongi sniffled a bit, as his eyes watered in happiness. “Let’s join the others.” Jin said as he passed a small stack of plates to the shorter man. ___________________________________________________________________Together, everyone snacked on Jin’s h'oeuvres d'oeuvres and sipped on the drinks of their choice. As time went on, Jin’s consumption of eggnog continued, leaving him blushing and laughing while he clung tightly to Namjoon when the situation allowed. For the first time since he was evicted from the only home he knew, Yoongi knew he was surrounded by people who loved and cared about him. He interacted with Jimin and Jungkook tonight more than he had in the whole time he had worked with them. They joked and talked as if they had been friends for years. Namjoon passed out everyone’s respective stockings. They all revealed their gifts of candy and small novelty items, to each other as the excitement in the room seemed to illuminate the area. Jungkook relaxed, reclined in Jimin’s lap as he offered him bites of his chocolate bar.  Namjoon and Jin stood near the group and watched watched happily with their arms around each other. On occasion, Namjoon would peck Jin’s cheek endearingly. Jin spoke up. “Presents now?” A uniform “Yeah!” came from the group of four men. They passed around their gifts, making sure that everyone had the right one. The first to open his was Namjoon, he hid his face laughing into the crumpled paper when he tore it back, revealing a first aid kit. “Because I’m always hurting myself, right?” Jimin nodded. Who was also next to open his, he got a pair of fuzzy socks. Disappointing to some, but Jimin was far too excited to wait, and put them on hastily, wiggling his toes at everyone to show them off. Jin’s gift from Jungkook was a Super Mario figurine. Jin was always easy to shop for. And Jin’s gift to Jungkook was a gift card to his favorite lamb skewer restaurant. He clutched it firmly to his chest as he daydreamed about eating them. The only two left were Yoongi and Hoseok. “You go first.” Hoseok said to Yoongi, he couldn’t hold in his anticipation anymore. Yoongi unwrapped the soft gift and gasped holding it up. “A poodle sweater! I love it.” His smile so wide it could probably be seen from another galaxy. He immediately slipped it over his shirt. “Press the nose.” Hoseok informed. The lights around the dog lit up. Yoongi let out a high pitched laugh as he exclaimed his love for the sweater again. Hoseok’s turn finally came. The gift was superbly wrapped, it was true that working at The North Pole taught someone a lot. Not wanting to ruin Yoongi’s precise work in an instant, Hoseok carefully pulled back the paper. His eyes lit up and his mouth hung open when he saw what was inside. In front of his audience of friends, he held up two green and red knitted mittens. “Your hands are always cold, I thought you needed them for when I’m not around to warm them.” Yoongi said shyly. “Did you knit these yourself?” He questioned, still admiring the stitches. “Yes. It took me about 12 hours in total.” He scratched his head in unease. So that’s why Yoongi had been so secretive and absent the past few days.Hoseok tried them on for size, they fit him perfectly. They must have held hands enough for him to know their measurements. Everyone returned to their activities. Jimin, Jungkook, and Namjoon sat by the crackling fireplace as they told stories of their old Christmas traditions growing up. Jin hung back and proudly ate some of the food he had spent the entire day creating. On the couch, Yoongi told Hoseok that he would like to talk to him privately for a bit.
Hoseok complied and informed Jin that they would be taking a short walk in his backyard. Jin nodded in understanding, and before the two men walked out the door, he called out to them. “If you guys get lost, just press Yoongi’s sweater!” ________________________________________________________________________Outside, they walked close together. Periodically taking turns looking at the night sky and pointing out different constellations that were now more visible than what they were used to in the middle of the city. Hoseok still wore the mittens Yoongi had made for him.
“You’ll have to warm my hands now.” Yoongi announced. “I don’t have my mittens, but you have some.”  He held out his hand, inviting Hoseok to share his warmth. Hoseok happily obeyed. As they walked through the snow hand-in-hand again, Yoongi began to talk about what he wanted to bring up with Hoseok earlier. “I’m sure you noticed...the ‘Secret Santa’ wasn’t so secret.” Hoseok chuckled. “Yeah, Jin wasn’t so subtle about that.”“I asked him to pair me up with you.”Hoseok’s hand squeezed the other’s. “I’m glad you did.” “Yeah. Otherwise I wouldn’t have this sweater!” Yoongi pressed it again and watched as the lights on his torso illuminated the emptiness around him. Hoseok stopped and placed himself in front of Yoongi. He gripped his face in his mittened hands, warming his icy skin. He noticed the rosy glow of his cheeks in the cold. “Really, Yoongi. I’m happy I found you.” Their lips met, allowing some heat to transfer between the two. “I’m happy too.” In their walk, they came upon Jin and Namjoon’s garden. The usually vibrant and colorful landscape was covered in a tarp for the winter. They dusted off the snow and sat on a bench together. Hoseok’s head rested on Yoongi’s shoulder as Yoongi rubbed his thumb over Hoseok’s bundled hand.Hoseok felt as if he could fall asleep where he was, it didn’t even feel cold with Min Yoongi next to him. Yoongi cleared his throat. “So, you want to know what we are? Like what our relationship is?”That question was enough to wake Hoseok up completely. “Hm?” He asked, repositioning himself so that his head rested on Yoongi’s lap while the rest of his body laid on the bench. Yoongi released his grip from Hoseok’s hand and started to play with his brown hair as he looked into his eyes and spoke. “I want to kiss you all the time.” “Then do it.” Hoseok responded, eye contact unbreaking.  Yoongi leaned forward, caressing Hoseok’s face and their lips connected for the second time that night. This time Yoongi put more vigor into it, lightly biting Hoseok’s bottom lip. Breaking the kiss, he looked at Hoseok again. “I would be proud to call you my boyfriend.” Hoseok sat up, straddling Yoongi, who spread his legs to support the weight. “Then do it.” He leaned into Yoongi, unintentionally causing the lights on his sweater to light up. Their tongues wrestled with each other, the heat between the two of them heightened as Hoseok began to grind passionately on Yoongi’s lap. When Yoongi tried to mutter something under his breath, Hoseok shushed him. “No one can see us.” He assured. ___________________________________________________________________________Jin wondered if they had actually gotten lost. He knew his back yard was large, but hopefully they didn’t end up frozen to death in the snow. He walked upstairs to his bedroom window, where he had a clear view of the back yard. He pulled back the curtains and searched around. His questions were quickly answered. He noticed a colorful light appear rhythmically where the bench in his garden was located. If he squinted, he could make out a suspicious shadow that sometimes obscured the illumination. He managed to put the signs together. He let out a small cough and quickly looked away, closing the curtains tightly to insure no one else intruded on their impassioned moment from a distance. He fought back a smirk as he walked downstairs to tend to his other guests._____________________________________________________________________________Hoseok paused their heated kissing session to let Yoongi breathe. As he was now panting with eyes half-lidded, his hands searching for Hoseok’s belt buckle. Hoseok responded by nibbling Yoongi’s ear and whispering to him. “It’s too cold for this right now...but come home with me tonight and I’ll make sure your Christmas is memorable.” Yoongi choked out a raspy “uh-huh” and nodded before his eyes closed and his head tilted back. A couple moans managed to escape from the back of his throat before he suggested that they migrate back to Jin’s house. The walk to the front door allowed them to calm down enough for them to successfully socialize with everyone again.
They entered the warmth of Jin and Namjoon’s home once again, but instead of seperate, they were together, still holding hands. And were greeted just as warmly by everyone’s smiling faces. They watched as Jin managed to finally sneak a kiss under the mistletoe out of Namjoon, who had now also imbibed on slightly too much eggnog. “Did you guys get lost?” Jimin quipped at them, throwing a paper snowflake he had freshly cut in their direction. “Not at all.” Hoseok responded, picking up the snowflake and draped it on top of Yoongi’s head.
They sat down at the coffee table and joined Jimin and Jungkook in their craft making. Hoseok observed as Yoongi spoke. Gesturing, laughing, smiling, shouting, and sometimes he would look over at Hoseok and smile wider. Jung Hoseok loved Min Yoongi. He wanted to tell him, but he would wait. He knew that Yoongi loved him as well, he didn’t say it. He didn’t need to. Hoseok just knew. And if he never did, he would be okay too. As long as Yoongi was by his side, he knew.
