Chapter Notes
warnings for blood/injury, the ghostly equivalent of an anxiety attack, some angst (sorry) (really)this is the being human au, featuring vampire!namjoon, werewolf!yoongi, and ghost!hoseok (as well as warlock!seokjin though he's not in this one hehe). for the prompts: a relieved kiss and tending an injury.



"Ow, ow! Careful! I came in here with all my limbs intact and I'd like to leave that way, asshole—!""Can you stop wiggling around? It's hard enough trying to clean all these cuts without you flinching every ten seconds—""Yeah, well, it hurts, Namjoon-ah!" Hoseok hovers outside the closed bathroom door, anxiety twisting him up in knots. He was drifting in the grey sea of Elsewhere when Namjoon's and Yoongi's voices, harsh and angry, brought him back into the world. They fled into the bathroom before he could catch a glimpse of them, and now... His hands clench into fists at his sides. The lights in the hall dim and then brighten.Yoongi's hurt. If Hoseok focuses, he can almost smell the faintly metallic scent of Yoongi's blood on the air, the hints of stale fear and adrenaline. Almost. The filaments inside the lightbulbs crackle and pop with excess electricity, filling the air around him with ozone. Sense is beyond him, just past his fingertips however much he outstretches his hand towards it, ever an unattainable goal. Something he'll never reach, never again. The bulb in the ceiling light above his head shatters.Hoseok yelps and covers his head with his arms, though the glass passes harmlessly through his incorporeal form. Too late, he hears clattering in the bathroom, confused voices and footsteps approaching the door. It swings open.Namjoon stands in the doorway, surrounded by a halo of soft, golden light from the bathroom light fixtures. His eyes widen as he spots Hoseok in the hall, and Hoseok stumbles back a step, his hands still raised over his head. Namjoon's gaze darts around the hallway, taking in the pendant lamp above, the shattered glass on the carpet, and Hoseok's guilty expression in between."Oh," Namjoon says. "Are you alright, Hoseok-ah?""Dead," Hoseok whispers. "It can't hurt me." He can feel himself starting to flicker now. He hasn't made something explode in a long time, not in... He doesn't remember. He can't remember, it's been so long, all of his lost years lengthening into a pale stalemate of monotonous, dulled horror. But then... Namjoon and Yoongi stumbled into his world and all at once he could be seen and heard again. After so many years of grey silence... a small spark of hope relit inside his chest.Namjoon's cheeks dimple as he smiles now, and if Hoseok still had a heart it would be racing. "Me, too," he says sweetly. "Do you want to come in?" He takes a step back and pulls the door open further, an invitation, as if Hoseok couldn't just pass through the walls if he wanted. It's a charming gesture. A smile tugs at the corner of Hoseok's mouth, and he turns his head away shyly."I do want," he says, his voice gone even softer. It seems to echo from him in the hallway, the lights around them flicking on and off. He glances down at the glass on the floor. "I... made a mess.""Yoongi'll clean it up once he's feeling up to it," Namjoon says, waving a hand. "He wants to see you, if you want to see him," he continues after a moment. "Do you want to?"Hoseok opens his mouth to answer, but drifts sideways through the wall, instead. Both Namjoon and Yoongi jump and swear loudly as he reappears, halfway through the bathroom counter, his hips bracketed by the sink. Shaking his head, Namjoon closes the door and returns to crouch at Yoongi's side. Yoongi himself sits perched on the edge of the bathtub, dressed only in a towel, bloody gouges, dirt, and bruises. A pile of bloodied gauze sits on the floor between his feet."Yoongi," Hoseok whispers, almost pained. "You're— I—" Words are hard, his voice still small and distant. Hoseok closes his mouth, hesitates. "...Rough night?" he tries again, blinking.Yoongi stares up at Hoseok, his pupils impossibly small in his eyes. The bathroom lights aren't bright enough, but so soon after a shift, he must still be sensitive. Hoseok drifts closer, hovering on the edge of the tub beside him, his body halfway through the sliding glass shower door."'Seok," Yoongi says softly. He reaches out but stops himself, his hand halting an inch from Hoseok's transparent cheek. "Bit rough, yeah," he says, hand dropping back to his bare thigh. "Were you worried about me?"Hoseok nods, not trusting himself to speak anymore. Yoongi keeps gazing over at him as Namjoon continues cleaning his wounds, his eyes slowly returning to their normal, beautiful shade of brown over the course of the hour. Hoseok flickers now and then, but he clings to this moment fiercely. Namjoon and Yoongi continually bicker, arguing good-naturedly about anything and everything out of sheer principle alone. That spark in Hoseok's chest grows just a tiny bit brighter, a soft beacon in the deep, grey dark.As Namjoon finishes cleaning the last of the injuries, a deep puncture in Yoongi's side, Hoseok feels his grip on this, on staying here and not Elsewhere, weakening. No, he wants to say, but he can no longer speak. No, not now. It's not fair.Bending down, he grazes his lips over Namjoon's forehead in a whisper of a kiss. He's fading fast. Turning, Hoseok cups his intangible hands about Yoongi's jaw, leaning in to brush a kiss to his cheek. Yoongi turns to stare at him in surprise, his soft lips parted as if to speak. Hoseok smiles, and everything turns grey.

The apartment is empty. Namjoon left for work that morning and Yoongi doesn't have to leave for his own shift for another two hours. He's sprawled out on the couch, has been since he woke up, watching shitty afternoon TV. The window is cracked open, a cool breeze billowing the curtains, pushing his hair into his eyes. He doesn't move, unable to even if he wanted to, which he doesn't. Tipping his head back, he sighs, his eyes falling shut.Hoseok's been gone for the past fifteen days, to wherever he fades off to when the physical world, when life gets too overwhelming for him. Seokjin calls it death. Hoseok only ever calls it Elsewhere. Yoongi doesn't know. Honestly, he doesn't care. If Hoseok doesn't come back by midnight tonight, he and Namjoon have a plan to go there somehow and bring him back themselves.It's quiet. The television chatters on, little more than white noise to his ears, blending in with the ambient street sounds filtering through the window. He breathes in through his nose and out through his mouth, ragged fingernails digging into the edge of the couch cushion at either side of his thighs, fingers tensing and relaxing. Even a week out from full, he can feel the moon tugging at his bones like a tide rushing away from shore. He aches with it. He doesn't sense anything, nothing new or different. Yet something compels him to open his eyes, to tilt his head to the side on the back of the couch cushion, and see Hoseok sitting beside him. He's not startled, somehow. Hoseok smiles, sweet and soft. He's more transparent today than Yoongi's seen him in months, but at least he's here. Relief floods through Yoongi. He's here. He's beautiful and he came back."Hello, hyung," Hoseok says. His voice is distant, fading in and out of focus, as if coming from a badly tuned radio. He came back. "I missed you.""I missed you, too," Yoongi says, pushing himself up. "I— are you okay?" He gets halfway across the couch before his mind kicks back in, his hand dropping uselessly to the couch between them. The urge to touch never fully goes away, but especially not this close to a full moon. He's always been tactile, but the curse only intensified it. "It's felt so empty without you around. Namjoon's been quiet. Even more than usual. Seokjin hyung's locked himself up in his shop, I haven't seen him in days." We need you here. I need you here, he wants to say. He doesn't. Tilting his head down to hide a shy smile, Hoseok says, "I tried to come back sooner." His smile falters, dropping from his face. "It was hard, I couldn't... The pull of the river was too strong, I couldn't fight it. Until something called out to me." He lifts his head to meet Yoongi's gaze for a moment and ducks away. "I guess it was you.""I'm glad you're back," Yoongi says, when he wants to say, If you hadn't come back by the end of the day, we would've broken the world in half to find you. His nails dig into the cushion, tensing and relaxing. He licks his lips. "I'm glad you're back, Hoseok-ah. We all will be. It's not right without you here with us."Hoseok flickers. Yoongi's heart thrums in his ears, breath quickening. No, not again. He couldn't bear it if Hoseok faded away so quickly. The faint glow around Hoseok's form seems to expand outward as Yoongi watches, his eyes clenched shut tight. The light pushes out and out and out like ripples in a pond. Yoongi feels cold, but he doesn't dare blink.Hoseok solidifies. Yoongi can still see the beams of sunlight slanting through him. "Holy shit," he breathes.Hoseok's eyelashes flutter as his chest swells as if taking a breath. He blinks, his eyes a beautiful, deep brown, rich and warm. "Hyung," he says, and he smiles. Yoongi shifts closer on the couch. Not enough to touch, not yet. Not without permission. "Hoseok-ah," he whispers. Hoseok's brow furrows, his eyes falling shut again for a split second, and Yoongi's breath catches in his throat, sharp like a shard of glass. Fuck. "Does it hurt," he asks softly, and Hoseok shakes his head before the words even leave his lips. "No," he murmurs. "It's... Strange, hyung. I'm too weak, I don't think I can stay this way for long. I might fade again, but...""Why are you?" Yoongi asks, crossing the final few inches between them. His hand hovers over Hoseok's jean-clad knee. "Why risk it?" Hoseok opens his eyes. Yoongi can see a light shining in Hoseok's irises, something real and true and his. "Hoseok-ah," he says, mouth taking on a mind of its own as he loses himself in Hoseok's eyes. He leans closer. "Hoseok-ah, can I kiss you?"Hoseok stares, silent, his mouth hanging open. His edges blur, faded like an old photograph. "...Yes," he whispers after an unbearable pause.Yoongi rises up on his knees, shifting in and bending forward. he rests his hand over Hoseok's cheek. For a moment, he can almost feel the suggestion of a curve beneath his palm before any sensation is replaced by the very absence of warmth, dragging any heat from Yoongi's skin. His eyes flutter closed just as he touches his mouth to Hoseok's.There's resistance for a split-second, as if sinking mouth first into a deep bank of snow. He breathes out, and he doesn't feel Hoseok's lips. As that thought registers, the tentative resistance is gone and he's falling. It's cold, a rush of freezing air, and he slips off the edge of the couch.He hits the floor with an impressive SMACK, knocking the wind from his lungs. He lies there on the floor, stunned, struggling to breathe. He chokes on nothing, his eyes wide as he stares at the floor beneath him. Slowly he begins to recover, drawing short breaths and rolling onto his back."Oh my god," Hoseok whispers, his voice hitching with laughter. "Oh my god, are you okay, hyung?"Yoongi looks up. Hoseok's still perched on the edge of the couch, staring down at him, laughing mouth hidden behind his hand. He draws another long, rattling breath into his lungs. He coughs. "Just my ego got hurt," Yoongi wheezes, and frowns. "I'm so stupid, I don't know why I thought that would work." Hoseok giggles again, ringing bright like a crisp, clear bell. Yoongi's cheeks warm and he turns his face away, embarrassed. Hoseok can tell. Of course he can tell. He bends down, cupping Yoongi's cheeks in his hands and turning his head towards him. It's that same resistance, that feeling like sinking into a fresh snow bank, new and untouched. Hoseok kisses him, a brief brush of his lips over Yoongi's that feels like night frost melting into morning dew on a blade of grass. Yoongi stares up at him. He almost doesn't even believe Hoseok is real. Moth to a flame, he follows after Hoseok as their lips part, rising up a few inches from the floor. "Thank you for trying, hyung," Hoseok whispers, and Yoongi can almost feel a thumb stroke across his cheekbone. Yoongi, still staring, realizes his mouth is hanging open and shuts it. Hoseok is so close. He can't remember the last time Hoseok was this close to him, close enough he could count Hoseok's lashes if he had the presence of mind to focus on anything beyond how long and delicately curved and beautiful they are. Oh. "No problem," he says, a bit breathless. "Just let me know if you ever want another, Hoseok-ah."

As soon as Namjoon walks through the door, he lets out a startled yelp when he sees Yoongi crouched in the dark hallway by the door like a creeper, waiting for him. "The fuck!" he yelps. If he had a heart that worked, it would be pounding at his ribs like a battering ram. Yoongi doesn't even have the decency to look sheepish. He doesn't even have the decency to respond at all, though his shoulders shake with a laugh more breath than sound.Namjoon kicks off his shoes and kicks the door shut behind him for good measure, turning the deadbolt over. "Fuck you," he says, resting his forehead against the door before turning back around. He can hear the rustling of bloodbags in his lunchbag. He really ought to get them back in the fridge. "The fuck are you still doing here?" To make up for what the moons take out of him, Yoongi usually takes on as many odd hours as he can get away with. "I thought you had to work a shift before we stormed the gates of the underworld, or whatever."Tilting his head, Yoongi stares up at Namjoon through his fringe, a hint of a smile playing at the corners of his mouth. Creep. Sometimes Namjoon thinks they should've been reversed, that Namjoon should've gotten scratched and Yoongi should've been bitten."Guess who found his way back to us," Yoongi says, finally. If it still worked, Namjoon's heart would've skipped a beat, would've done a somersault in his chest. He can't possibly mean... After all these weeks—Movement out the corner of Namjoon's eye catches his attention. Hoseok, their Hoseok, beams at him from over Yoongi's shoulder, leaning halfway through the wall. Namjoon stumbles back into the door, his eyes wide. "Hoseok," he whispers.Hoseok's smile widens, but it falters as Yoongi shivers. His arm half-slid through Yoongi's shoulder as he leaned further through the wall. "Oh! Oh no!" he cries, shrinking back into the wall and drifting to the side, hovering over the floor beside Yoongi. "Sorry about that, hyung! I got too excited! I missed you both so much!"Laughing, Yoongi's hands clench into fists at his sides, as if he's only barely resisting reaching out to fondly ruffle Hoseok's hair or tweak his earlobe the way he does with their younger friends. "It's okay, Hoseokie," he says, and that smile spreads even further across his face, soft and tender. (Another heart somersault. Shut up.)Yoongi glances over at Namjoon, then, still smiling. "Help me up, Namjoon-ah," he says, holding out his hands. Namjoon takes them, hauling the slighter man to his feet. Yoongi slings his arm around Namjoon's waist as Hoseok floats ahead of them up the hall. "I don't know what happened, or how," Yoongi says.Namjoon forgets himself, curling his arm around Yoongi's shoulders and bumping his lips against his temple. Together, they make their way further into the apartment, following after Hoseok, still smiling. He looks radiant, a faint corona of light surrounding him now that Namjoon never noticed before. How—?"—I had my eyes closed," Yoongi's saying, and Namjoon forces himself to pay attention. "I was alone. then I... Something made me open my eyes, and there he was. He came back to us, Namjoon-ah. He came back."Hoseok nods. His form flickers. He doesn't speak again. Maybe he can't.It hits Namjoon like a gut punch. Sometimes Hoseok expends so much energy just being, simply through exerting all the will he possesses to stay here, to not fade away. He understands how much effort it takes for Hoseok to stay with them. Hoseok smiles at Namjoon, his eyes bright and dancing. He's beautiful, and he's here. Namjoon hugs Yoongi a little closer, and Yoongi lets him.Later, Namjoon lies sprawled out on his bed, staring up at the ceiling. His eyelids are heavy, lulled by Yoongi's muttered curses as he moves his things around his side of the room, preparing for the next day. It's soothing, after these past three years of clinging to each other to keep afloat in the turbulent, horrific waters their lives had become: Yoongi, his curse; Namjoon, his rebirth.It's been so long now, settled into a routine that makes Namjoon feel like he's listening to a favourite song. Namjoon almost can't remember his life before, of being alive instead of... whatever in-between he is now. He almost can't remember his life before Yoongi, who saved him from losing himself. His blinks seem to grow longer and longer with each passing second. With living blood from the source, Namjoon wouldn't need to sleep much. Thanks to an ingenious spell crafted by their friendly local warlock, Kim Seokjin, however, Namjoon has subsisted on the meagre sustenance dead blood can offer him for the past three years. An empty bloodbag crinkles at his elbow as Namjoon shifts beneath his blankets. Armed with as full a stomach as he can get these days, he hopes to sleep through the night. On the other side of the curtain, Yoongi seems to have finished with his nightly preparations at last. The bedsprings creak under his weight as he climbs up into his bed. He settles."Good night, hyung," Namjoon calls."Wait," Yoongi says. "I— wait. Are you. Are you tired? Can we talk?"Namjoon doesn't speak for a moment. He blinks up at the dark ceiling overhead, split by a sliver of soft yellow light that shines between the gap in the curtains that separates their living spaces. "Yeah," he says. "If you want.""It's about Hoseokie," Yoongi says softly, and he switches off his bedside lamp, plunging the room into darkness. It takes Namjoon's eyes a moment to adjust. "I... I didn't feel anything different when he arrived, I can't explain it," Yoongi continues, "I just somehow knew he would be there the instant my eyes opened and I saw him beside me." He heaves a noisy sigh, and Namjoon listens as his blankets rustle. "I was certain of it, sure as how the sky is blue, or the pull of the moon on my bones, Jung Hoseok was there beside me." A thoughtful silence follows Yoongi's words. Namjoon watches the ceiling in the dark. He can't imagine just knowing. Hoseok, bright as he is, has always caught Namjoon by surprise."...It was almost as if—" Yoongi's voice falters. "Well," he tries again after a pause. "I don't know, it doesn't matter. I... I kissed him, Namjoon-ah."Namjoon rises on his elbows and the empty bloodbag crinkles again. "Excuse me?""I kissed him," Yoongi repeats. "Namjoon-ah, I kissed him, and there was this moment, I... I swear that there was this moment that I almost felt him? I know it's stupid. It's probably stupid, but I— anyway, then I fell through him and hit the floor so hard I knocked the wind out of myself."Snickering, Namjoon rolls over onto his side, trying to stifle the sound.Yoongi's bedframe creaks. "Shut up," he whines. Something soft hits the floor beside Namjoon's bed with a muffled flump. A pillow. Namjoon glances back over his shoulder just in time to catch a glimpse of Yoongi's scowl through the swinging curtains. "You're just jealous that I kissed him first."Namjoon keeps laughing. He rolls over onto his back with a thoughtful sound a few minutes later, though no less amused. "...Maybe I could kiss him," he muses aloud. "I mean, I am dead, too, right?""If he's still here and wants to, we'll try it tomorrow," Yoongi says."Tomorrow," Namjoon agrees and yawns. "Good night, hyung."Yoongi makes an amused sound. "Sleep well, Namjoon-ah."The next morning, Hoseok's still here. He's waiting for them, perched on the kitchen counter (well, hovering over it). He smiles when he sees them. "Good morning!" he chirps.Yoongi, still bleary-eyed and sleep-rumpled, pauses to give Hoseok a small smile in response before shuffling past to begin his morning ritual of putting a pot of coffee on to brew.Namjoon pushes himself up to sit beside Hoseok on the counter. "Good morning, Hoseok-ah," he says.Hoseok's smile widens. "Did you dream about me?" he asks teasingly."Maybe," Namjoon replies with a shy smile. He seldom remembers his dreams. His pinky finger almost grazes the fuzzy outline of Hoseok's on the kitchen counter between them. He stares down at their hands. Hoseok hums a soft tune under his breath. The lights in the kitchen slowly brighten, then dim. Namjoon wonders what it might be like to lace his fingers with Hoseok's, somehow. "Hoseokie," he begins in a whisper, looking up at meeting Hoseok's gaze."Yes?" Hoseok replies, leaning closer. Namjoon hesitates. "Could I... Yoongi hyung told me what happened yesterday," he says, under cover of the loud, whirring crackle of Yoongi grinding coffee beans. He feels a strange tingling feeling in his fingertips. "About how he kissed you, and I..." Namjoon swallows. Hoseok's eyes are bright as he nods encouragingly, catching the sunlight and amplifying the deep tones of his irises. Namjoon could lose himself here for days. "You...?" Hoseok prompts."Could I kiss you, too?" Namjoon's voice cracks as the grinder finishes, loud in the sudden stillness in the kitchen."That's how you're gonna ask?" Yoongi demands, looking far more awake and eyes dancing with a sort of fiendish glee as he turns around. His irises are brighter still, flashing a preternatural amber as the moon waxes ever nearer to full. "That's embarrassing, Namjoon-ah.""Shut up, you loser," Namjoon hisses, half-amused, half-serious. "You couldn't even do it properly, so watch how it's done—!"Beside him, Hoseok hiccups with laughter. He slips down a bit in his distraction, sinking into the countertop, his hands clasped together in front of his chest. "Okay," Hoseok gasps, after a moment. He rights himself, rising back up. His cheeks are pink, Namjoon notices, as Hoseok's hands lower back down to his sides. If he weren't semi-translucent and fading around the edges, he almost might pass for one of the living. "Okay," Hoseok says again, turning towards Namjoon with a smile. "I think I'd really like it if you kissed me, Namjoon-ah."Namjoon's eyes go wide. "O-oh," he says, because he hadn't quite thought past asking for permission. What does he even do now? Why are his palms sweaty? He didn't even know his palms could still sweat. "I— yeah," he clears his throat. "Yeah, okay. Right now, you mean?" Hoseok watches him, still smiling. Namjoon nods, "...Right." He shifts over slowly, his gaze drifting between Hoseok's eyes to his lips and back again, ever wary of Hoseok changing his mind. To his surprise, Hoseok leans forward to meet him partway and their mouths touch. It's... not what he expected. Almost.Brief and soft, and there's something... there's something here. He almost feels it, almost — a gentle pressure against his lips, cold, but not unwelcoming. Tipping his head to the side, Namjoon presses in further, reaching up as if to curl his hand around the nape of Hoseok's neck and bring him in even further. His hand slides through cold air. Too late to react, Namjoon finds himself falling with nothing to catch him. Overbalanced, he slips right off the edge of the counter and comes crashing down to the floor with an almighty thud. His hip throbs at impact and he rolls over onto his back with a pained groan, staring up at the ceiling. "Fuck," he says, and then with more feeling, "ow."Laughter echoes around the tile kitchen, bouncing back and multiplying. From beside the burbling coffee maker, Yoongi clutches at his sides, bent forward at the waist from laughing so hard. Hoseok covers his mouth with his hand, but that does nothing to stifle the sweet, ringing sound of his laughter. The tips of his ears are a bright, glowing pink.Namjoon sighs. Even so, he'd gotten to kiss Hoseok. That's something.Hoseok drifts down to crouch beside Namjoon, cheeks pink and eyes still bright with laughter. "Ah, my Namjoonie," he whispers, his voice gone strange and echoing as if coming from far away. He leans in closer, his hand cupping Namjoon's jaw. Namjoon can almost feel it, the cold of his touch even colder than Namjoon's skin. "Did you get hurt because of me?" he asks, ducking his head and he kisses Namjoon on the mouth again, sweet and slow.(This is more than another heart somersault. Namjoon knows his heart would be doing backflips at this point.) A gentle pressure, a gentle cold leaching whatever strange undead warmth Namjoon possessed. Not quite a kiss, not quite, but close. Namjoon doesn't press into it, lets his eyes stay closed, lets Hoseok come to him in his own time. He feels a twitch, a curve, a suggestion of a smile against his lips.When he opens his eyes, he sees Hoseok still blushing. He sees Yoongi, staring at them, his mouth hanging open, his own cheeks dusted with pink. "Oh," Namjoon says."I liked that very much," Hoseok murmurs, and he sounds like he's coming from far away, out of Namjoon's reach even though he's still sitting right in front of him. "Thank you."

Hoseok hovers on the periphery of the worlds, straddling the boundary between Elsewhere and Life. He's unaware of time passing, unaware of his surroundings. Everything is a softened, hazy grey, and he is alone.Or, not quite. Distant sounds reach his ears. The creak of a floorboard, soft fabric hissing and swishing across the wooden floors. He tips his head to the side, eyes out of focus, listening. The gentle padding of socked feet across the floor, getting louder and louder. A touch. "—there? Can — hear —? 'Seokie?"The world around him seems to sharpen, coming into focus. Seokjin is sitting beside him on the windowsill, head tilted to the side as he looks into Hoseok's face. He smiles as their eyes meet, gentle and curious."There you are," Seokjin says. "I wasn't sure if you'd come back to us.""Here I am," Hoseok agrees, but that doesn't sound right. He still feels too distant, too fuzzy, too numb. He's not present, not really. He frowns, his gaze returning to the window, and the shades of grey rolling in the distance. Everything beyond is grey, rain streaking down the plane of glass. The oblivion of Elsewhere calls to him. It would be too easy to slip into Death, to let the river wash him away."—'Seokie." Seokjin's speaking again, and Hoseok turns towards him, trying to hear. The smile on Seokjin's face is growing into something almost teasing and playful. His eyes sparkle with life, and Hoseok longs to cling to it.A sound catches Hoseok's attention, and he turns his head, startled to see Namjoon and Yoongi standing before them. Namjoon looks calm, the overcast grey light washing him out. There's a trace of red at the corner of his mouth. Yoongi looks more vibrant than both Seokjin and Namjoon combined, his eyes bright as he smiles. Hoseok feels drawn to it, drawn to him. He feels the corners of his mouth lift."Hello," Hoseok says. His voice sounds... wrong, echoing and resonant. He frowns again, retreating into himself. This isn't right. It's been too long, he shouldn't still be here."Our Yoongi and Namjoonie told me a secret," Seokjin says, leaning in towards Hoseok, drawing his gaze, that smile still on his face. "They told me they tried to kiss you."Oh. Hoseok feels an odd vibration in his fingertips, a hissing sort of feeling like a lightbulb about to burn out. "Yes," he whispers. The wind rattles the window pane in its frame. Even when he was alive, Hoseok can't think of anyone risking falling flat on their faces just for a chance to kiss him. Him. As if he were something special. Something worth falling for. How? "Yes, they did.""I'd like to kiss you, too," Seokjin continues. "If you want me to."Something clenches, deep down, rapid and painful like crushing an aluminum can in a bare hand. Hoseok stares at Seokjin for a moment, his vision growing hazy and a tingling at the base of his neck. "I do," he says.I just wish I could feel it, wish I could feel something, he does not say. As Seokjin shifts over, leaning in close, Hoseok closes his eyes and waits. There's a rush, a subtle hint of a touch, and then nothing. Yoongi and Namjoon start to laugh, and when Hoseok opens his eyes, Seokjin is pouting.If Hoseok had something resembling a heart, it would shatter. As it is, he feels that vibration intensify, his vision clouding over grey for a moment. "I'm sorry," he begins. he draws back even further into himself, shaking his head. " I shouldn't—"Seokjin grabs him. Him. His long fingers curl around Hoseok's forearms, catch hold and keep him tight. Hoseok's eyes go wide. He doesn't breathe, but there's a strange hitch that rocks through his entire body. He can't move. He can almost feel Seokjin's fingers digging into his skin. A distant feeling, like it's happening to him but years ago. Skin memory.Seokjin keeps reeling him in, closer until they're pressed right up against each other. Hoseok can almost feel the warmth of Seokjin's breath on his cheek. His eyes flutter closed and he leans in to meet Seokjin's lips. It's so sweet, tentative and soft, and Hoseok can feel it, kind of. He can feel Seokjin's warmth, the way Seokjin's hands slide up Hoseok's arms to wrap around his back and hold him. Hoseok lifts his hands, and when he reaches out, his fingers curl in the soft fabric of Seokjin's shirt. He doesn't sink through.Hoseok forgets everything, tipping his head to the side, losing himself in this moment. A gentle brush of a tongue slides across the seam of his lips and he lets them part, welcomes Seokjin in, and it feels so good he might actually cry. Seokjin's tongue slides alongside his own, and he lets out a soft, low sound, bordering on a pained whimper.Seokjin starts to pull back, and Hoseok tightens his grip, surging back in and deepening the kiss. With a surprised little gasp, Seokjin lets him, tipping his head and kissing Hoseok more deeply. Warm fingers slide around the nape of Hoseok's neck, sliding up into his hair, and Hoseok moans, weak and broken.The window rattles beside them. The lights whine and hum as the filaments overheat. Seokjin doesn't pull away again. Hoseok loses all trace of time, any sense of anything but for the way Seokjin holds him, the movement of their mouths together, how it feels to touch and to be touched.Finally, they part and Hoseok's body hitches again, his hands still clenched tight in the front of Seokjin's shirt. He's not sinking through. He's still here."...Holy shit."Hoseok startles, releasing Seokjin and turning his head. Namjoon and Yoongi are still there with them, eyes wide and mouths agape. Seokjin throws his head back with a laugh, and Hoseok's attention snaps back to him. His lips look... pinker, almost swollen. Did Hoseok do that? How could he have possibly—?Seokjin's squeaking laugh is infectious, and Hoseok can't help but smile. A rush of pins and needles sting across Hoseok's scalp, creeping into his cheeks and down across the nape of his neck. He brushes his fingers across Seokjin's laughing cheek. Oh. His skin is so warm, tingling in his fingertips. He can feel him, almost.Namjoon and Yoongi join in, Namjoon's bright, hearty bursts of guffawing laughter a perfect counterpoint to Yoongi's low, breathless chuckling. It's beautiful. Hoseok wants to reach out to them, too. Seokjin gasps suddenly, his eyes gone wide, and Hoseok stares at him, startled. "Hoseok-ah," he breathes. Yoongi's laughter dies down and he steps closer, his eyes just as wide as Seokjin's. "Oh, my god."Namjoon's lips part in surprise. "Hoseok-ah," Namjoon says. "You're... you're blushing.""I've never seen a ghost blush before," Seokjin says, a fond smile spreading across his face. his fingertips brush over Hoseok's cheek, leaving a shivering thrill in his wake. "I didn't know ghosts could blush! But if any ghost could, it makes sense that it would be you, Hoseokie. You're so emotive and lively, even as a ghost."The world around Hoseok flickers, Life and Elsewhere and back again. No. No, not now. "I'm not blushing," Hoseok murmurs. His voice feels faded, soft and distant as if coming from another room. The others keep teasing him, sweet and fond. "Stop it." he ducks his head, covering his cheeks with his hands. "Don't be embarrassing.""We're not trying to embarrass you," Yoongi murmurs, crouching down to meet Hoseok's gaze. Hoseok feels a strange twinge deep inside of himself, a sharp tug backwards. "You're beautiful, Hoseokie.""Oh," Hoseok says, watching Yoongi for a moment. He moves forward, reaching out and finding purchase on Yoongi's face. "I have to go," he says, a deep ache rippling through him at the heartsick sadness in Yoongi's gentle eyes. "I'm sorry." He reaches out for Namjoon and Seokjin and they come, curling around both Hoseok and Yoongi. "I'm sorry," he repeats, and he drifts almost sideways into Elsewhere, standing calf-deep in the cold water rushing about his legs. The pull of the current isn't very strong here, this close to Life; deceptively tranquil and eager to pull underwater those who can't hold their feet. He glances back over his shoulder, letting his eyes go unfocused. In the middle distance, the greys lighten almost imperceptibly, a pathway back to Life. He reaches towards it, but it's out of reach. Slipping through his fingers like trying to hold water in his hands. Again. He'll be back, though. He won't leave them. Not now. A smile plays at the corners of his mouth as he steps forward, deeper into the water. It takes several steps before he notices the strange... It's not a beacon, not exactly, but a reflection of light bouncing back at him through the grey mists. Reflecting back at him. His eyes drop and he hastily bites back a cry of alarm at the gentle pulse of light shining in his chest where his heart used to be. This close to Life, he must be careful of those denizens of the deeper rivers of Elsewhere trying to claw their way back. They might take him.His hands raise, coming up to cover the light, smothering it out. He turns away, back towards Life, his eyes pricked for anything approaching. Quiet, but for the gentle burble of the river swirling around his feet. It's quiet. He cups the light in his palms, radiating its gentle pink glow up towards his face with a soft smile. He covers the light again with his hands, bowing his head. He'll return to them. He must.



namyoon2seok / being human
Chapter Summary
a werewolf, a vampire, and a ghost move into an apartment together. their bestie is a warlock. that's it, that's the punchline.
Chapter Notes
warnings for (dark-ish) magic, eye horror, blood, and general creepiness, seancesfor the prompt: "look theres a reason why we do our rituals in private, things can get out of hand and sometimes we spit up blood, its not like we mean to do it. knock next time"this was very heavily inspired by the first season of the mabel podcast



While Kim Seokjin hadn't been paying attention, his clairvoyance to-do list has gotten rather out of hand. As a result, he finds himself on Namjoon, Yoongi and Hoseok's doorstep, and— well, what's a little breaking and entering between friends, anyway? He stands outside the door with his fingers cupped over the deadbolt, murmuring under his breath. As his hand turns, lock turns with it and the door swings open on well-oiled hinges. Seokjin walks inside, ducking down to unzip his boots and leaving them by the door. "Hoseok-ah," he calls, as he closes the door behind him. The deadbolt locks again at the snap of his fingers, and Seokjin walks further into the apartment. "Hoseok-ah, are you here?"It's quiet. Namjoon and Yoongi must be out, working the night shift at the hotel. He makes his way down the hall, the strap of his heavy leather bag creaking as it swings from his shoulder. "'Seok-ah, where are you?""...Hyung?" comes Hoseok's voice, hollow and distant. The living room. Seokjin turns and heads in that direction. He finds Hoseok perched on the windowsill, where he often found while he's on his own. Dark clouds roll outside the window, thick and heavy with rain. It's not raining yet, but it will soon. All the better for what Seokjin has planned for the evening.Setting his bag down on the floor beside the couch, Seokjin stretches his back, groaning as it pops and creaks. He swings his arms from side to side, further working the kinks from his spine. His grey coat swirls around him with the movement with a satisfying swish. Hoseok looks over from the window. Seokjin straightens out his shoulders, smiling as he meets Hoseok's inquisitive gaze."Hello, Hoseok-ah," he murmurs, removing his coat and draping it across the arm of the couch. Hoseok smiles back at him. He's more transparent today than Seokjin's seen him in a while. Seokjin wonders when Hoseok last let himself fade away to Death to recharge and regain some of his former strength. It must have been weeks ago, already."I've fallen behind on some work," Seokjin says. "See, I've made more than a few promises to those with dearly departed loved ones, but I haven't been able to keep them due to my research..."Research on how to best keep Hoseok on this plane. Not permanently, not yet, but there must be something longer-lasting than what periodically residing in Death grants him. He frowns, mentally running through his notes once again. He's so close to a solution, now, so close he can almost taste it. It's on the very tip of his tongue. "I simply cannot put a seance off any longer," Seokjin heaves a dramatic sigh, letting his shoulders droop. "I was wondering if I could get your help, Hoseok-ah. You're already dead, you see..." he shrugs.Hoseok beams up at him. "I am!""You'll just need to be my battery, if you understand what I mean," Seokjin goes on. "It will go much quicker with you to act as the sort of... The conduit to get into contact with those passed. It won't hurt you."Shrugging, Hoseok says, "What can?"Seokjin forces a smile on his face, though he can think of at least a dozen separate things that could hurt Hoseok from beyond the veil. There is no end to pain or suffering, not really. Not even in Death, not until you've passed beyond the final gate into oblivion. "So," Seokjin says, still smiling. "Will you help?""Of course!" Hoseok chirps, bouncing a bit on the windowsill. "Let's do it, hyung. I love doing magic with you."Still smiling, Seokjin unpacks his bag. He pulls out a small metal bowl, used candles, bundles of dried and fresh herbs, packets of incense, a container of salt, a ball of string, a knife, and a lighter. He and Hoseok work to prepare the room, purifying it with the herbs to create a neutral space to work in. Seokjin walks Hoseok through the process but notes that Hoseok almost seems to know what to do before Seokjin even has to tell him, moving as if by rote even as Seokjin speaks. It's the strangest feeling, but it's almost as if he's done this before. They set up a salt perimetre about the room, running lines along the windowsills and the doorways, to keep errant magic contained. That done, Seokjin unwinds a length of strong that he knots every six inches until it forms a single loop, followed by a band of salt around that, and a ring of lit candles in concentric circles with three inches between each. Hoseok and Seokjin sit down in the centre of these circles on the old, threadbare area rug, facing each other.Seokjin lights the incense, filling the air around them with heavily-fragranced smoke. Hoseok closes his eyes, mirroring Seokjin's cross-legged posture on the floor, open and expectant. Swallowing, Seokjin flips open his divination books and begins to murmur the channeling spell under his breath.As he finishes the incantation, Hoseok's back goes rigid, his head snapping back. Seokjin's heart pounds in his throat as he watches him, wary. A white mist spills out of Hoseok's opened mouth. His head falls forward as Seokjin waits, and when he blinks his eyes open, they've turned a pure, solid black.Seokjin takes up his pen and gets to work.*Namjoon nudges Yoongi's side with his elbow. Yoongi grumbles but straightens up as the bus approaches, pulling his wallet out of his pocket. It's been a long night, and Namjoon's eager to get home and treat himself to a blood bag before crashing into bed.They work at the same hotel; Namjoon as a room service operator, and Yoongi as a bartender. Though they don't get to see each other often during work hours, they often take the bus home together when their shifts happen to line up.Finding work after Namjoon was turned and Yoongi was cursed was almost impossible. It took long months of temp work and instability before they finally landed this gig at the hotel, which offers them stable work with few questions asked. A blessing, really. It's good, decent work. They get paid dirt, but between the two of them, they make enough to scrape by.Namjoon doesn't love his job, but until he can find work in a library, this is what he's stuck with. Who knows how many years he has ahead of him? A hundred? Two hundred? Even more? He can wait and see what fate has in store for him now.He shakes out of his thoughts as Yoongi drifts off beside him on the bus seat. It's late. Namjoon doesn't like to take the bus alone. Yoongi, he's fairly sure, doesn't give a shit either way, content to catch up on sleep until his stop. Namjoon looks out the window, watching over Yoongi's sleeping reflection, smiling to himself.When they arrive home, Namjoon can tell something is off, but he can't quite put his finger on what. He grabs the back of Yoongi's leather jacket as he trudges on ahead of him, dragging the older man back and moving forward to shield him. "Stay back," he murmurs.Yoongi begins to look affronted, but his nose twitches. It wrinkles. He must smell what Namjoon can feel: That strange electricity in the air; of ozone and damp, creeping growth. It smells of a forest gone to rot.They creep forward into their apartment as stealthily as they can, with Namjoon in the lead. His ears prick at a low, groaning voice that comes from the living room. He turns up the hall towards it, making his way forward. In the open doorway, he freezes.Their living room is partially shrouded in creeping vines, bits of plaster and dust littering the floor. Still more green strands break through the drywall even as he stands there, dumbstruck. The walls writhe with masses of this growth.Where did this come from? How is this even possible?Hoseok is facing them. Blood, bright red, solid blood drips from his eyes, trailing down his cheeks as he speaks in a low, hoarse, terrible voice that doesn't belong to him. Seokjin sits across from him, back facing Namjoon and Yoongi standing in the doorway, scribbling something in a notebook in his lap. Hoseok's eyes have turned a deep, unsettling black, wide and unblinking."What the fuck—" Yoongi begins. He pushes past Namjoon, stepping towards the door. As he attempts to cross the threshold, a flash of pulsing, flowing white light flares across the width of the door. Yoongi yelps in pain, stumbling back into Namjoon's arms. "Fuck, what the— Seokjin!""Seokjin hyung, what the fuck is going on!" Namjoon shouts, reaching out. A sharp, stinging pain numbs his fingers, shooting through his hand and up his arm as he tries to touch the white light in the door. He jerks away from it, cradling his hand and Yoongi to his chest. "What the fuck!"Seokjin whirls around. Yoongi sucks in a breath. His eyes have turned a bright white. Blood drips down his cheeks, off his chin, staining his white button-up shirt. "You can't come in," he says, his voice muffled as if coming from a poorly tuned radio. His hand is still racing across the notebook page. "We're working. It's just a bit of magic, calm down.""Calm down!?" Namjoon yelps,just as Yoongi shouts at the same time, "Your eyes are bleeding!" He wrenches himself free from Namjoon's arms, stumbling forward and bracing his hands on either side of the doorframe. "Don't you tell us to stay calm when you're both bleeding, Seokjin hyung. What the fuck are you doing?""I have everything under control," Seokjin says, turning back around. His hand doesn't falter as he continues writing, and that horrible voice keeps speaking ceaselessly through Hoseok as if neither of them could stop even if they tried.Hoseok doesn't seem aware of them, his eyes blank and unseeing. Blood drips off his cheeks like such horrible tears, pooling on the floor. He keeps on whispering without drawing breath, unintelligible to Namjoon's ears."We're almost... almost finished," Seokjin says, a bit strained.One of the candles surrounding them in a ring, at the point closest to Hoseok is almost entirely burned down, the flame sputtering. As Namjoon watches, the vines press in further, creeping across the floor towards them. He catches a hint of colour breaking through the with the ivy in the walls, delicate pink and white. Broad, flat tiers of mushrooms bloom across the walls in gaps between the vines, thick wedges of yellow, green and white.Namjoon has a bad feeling about this. He clings to Yoongi's back, tightening his hold around his waist. "Hyung...""I have everything under control," Seokjin repeats through gritted teeth. "I mean, maybe we overdid it a little, and possibly our Hoseokie here is channeling more power than either of us were prepared for, and perhaps there's a slight chance these weird vines might rip a hole into another dimension, but," he laughs but it sounds panicked. "You said you wanted to redecorate in here anyway, right!"Holy fucking fiery pits of hell, Namjoon thinks.Inside the room, Hoseok falls silent at last and Seokjin stops writing, the pen falling from his limp hand. Seokjin gasps. At once, his other hand snaps out for one of his books, pulling it up into his lap. He begins to chant in a language that doesn't make sense, that doesn't even sound real. Namjoon doesn't understand it nor recognizes Seokjin's voice as it becomes deeper and more guttural, rasping and horrible. He buries his face in the crook of Yoongi's neck and Yoongi releases his grip on the doorframe to curl an arm back around Namjoon's waist, holding him tight. Yoongi doesn't look away, not even for a second. Namjoon peeks over Yoongi's shoulder, horrified, ready to drag Yoongi away to safety.Seokjin sets the books aside, scrubbing the blood from his face with a handkerchief before rising to his knees. He holds both hands out, palms facing the ceiling, and finishes the incantation. That done, he reaches out for a glass of water sitting beside him on the floor.Blood still drips from Hoseok's black eyes. He stares at Seokjin, head tilted at a slight angle, expression blank. Dead. He doesn't even look like Hoseok. He looks almost... drowned.The vines are pushing through the walls with more frenzy now, breaking bigger holes through the drywall and slithering up the walls, covering the windows. Tendrils reach down from the ceiling and even more ivy creeps across the floor, circling the ring of candles. The candle just behind Hoseok goes out, and Seokjin dumps the entire glass of water into Hoseok's face.Hoseok sputters, gasping for breath, even though the water goes straight through him and he doesn't need to breathe. The remaining candles gutter out all at once and magic dissipates into the air around them, staticky and glinting as motes drift up before sparking out.The vines slip back through the walls as quickly as they'd come. With a yell, Seokjin leaps to his feet, vaulting over the salt, string, and candles. He pulls a jeweled pocket knife from his coat pocket and cuts a few clippings of the vines, stowing them in vials that he corks and slips back into his pockets.Seokjin turns, swallowing hard. "Alright, so," he says. "Admittedly, that didn't go as expected, but we're all alive and that's the important thing.""...Wow," Hoseok says, his voice a dull rasp. The blood has vanished from his face, but it's stained the carpet underneath him. "Wow, what was that?" He looks up, stunned expression melting into dismay as he catches sight of Yoongi and Namjoon staring through the doorway. Namjoon clings tighter to Yoongi, his mouth hanging open. Hoseok blinks, the corners of his mouth twitching down even further. "...What happened?""We..." Seokjin's voice falters and he stops, clearing his throat. "We got a bit carried away," he says, going over and picking up a bowl filled with what looks like dried herbs. He sets them on fire with a lighter, walking around the room and wafting smoke into each corner. Once that's done, he crosses to the windows, breaking the salt lines. Seokjin throws each window open wide to let the smoke and ashes drift out on the wind, into the rain starting to pour down from the sky.He turns, coming back over to crouch by Hoseok's side. With his pocketknife, he cuts the string and bundles it up, setting it in the bowl with the remaining herbs. He smudges through the salt ring with his fingertips. Hoseok looks up at him, his eyes bright and shining. He reaches out, but his fingers pass right through Seokjin's chest. He flinches back, curling in on himself. Seokjin smiles sadly. Getting to his feet, he crosses the room to break the salt lines in front of the doors. at once, Yoongi and Namjoon scramble across, entering the room. Hoseok looks up at them. "...W-what happened?" he repeats, his chin quivering.Namjoon drops down to his knees in front of Hoseok, reaching out for him. He holds his arms around Hoseok and Hoseok nestles closer. They don't quite touch, not quite, but it's enough. It's enough for now. Hoseok exhales, slow and trembling.Yoongi scowls at the puddles of wax left behind on the wooden floors. Ducking down, he begins to pick at the edges of the wax with his fingernails. "...This is such a huge fuckin' mess— you couldn't do this shit with flashlights, for fuck's sake?"Seokjin laughs. "What's wrong, Yoongi-yah... Not into wax play?"That startles a giggle past Hoseok's lips, and he trembles against Namjoon's side. He still sounds small and scared, but Namjoon can almost feel him. Almost.

Yoongi tightens his grip around his cock, eyes heavy-lidded but fixed on the video playing on the screen. Namjoon left for work around twenty minutes ago, and Yoongi hasn't seen their ghost roommate at all the entire day. Just to be safe, Yoongi locked himself in his room even though he shouldn't have to. The audio pipes softly through his laptop speakers, so low it's barely audible even with his preternatural hearing. The man on the screen gasps, a close-up on his face, a blindfold over his eyes. He has pouty lips, cute, pink and shining as he throws his head back and whines as the two men below him take turns fucking into him. Yoongi strokes himself a little faster."Hey, hyung," comes aforementioned ghost roommate Hoseok's voice, a split-second before he drifts through the wall. "Are you busy? I'm bored— whoa, alright, warn me next time, holy shit—!"Yoongi lets out a strangled noise somewhere between a moan and a distressed bellow, trying to hide his erection from sight. "You're the one who came waltzing in here with no warning?!" he shouts, both hands clamped down tight over his cock. His voice cracks and his cheeks flush with colour. Hoseok's still hovering halfway through the wall, staring at Yoongi, aghast. Another hot pulse of anger ripples through Yoongi, hackles raised. His heart thuds against his ribs. "You should warn me next time? Wear a goddamn bell, maybe?!"Recovering between one second and the next, seemingly over his surprise, Hoseok waves a hand like he's batting Yoongi's indignation out of the air. He drifts nearer, leaning over the bed to get a look at the video still playing on Yoongi's laptop screen. Yoongi makes a strangled, whimpering noise, cringing away from him. His boxers are still bunched around his thighs and he hasn't gotten a moment to himself to jerk off in so long. This was his one golden chance and now... Now, Hoseok is tilting his head to the side as he watches the video, and it's so awkward Yoongi feels like he's about to crawl out of his skin. Hoseok hums, tilting his head to the side. Yoongi's erection deflates more and more with each passing second, but he is determined to get off tonight. "What is that?" Hoseok asks, his tone light and curious, a smile on his face. His voice sounds distorted through the anxiety roaring in Yoongi's ears. "What do you even call that position? Oh, no way, is he gonna take them both at the same time? Fuck, that's brave— oh wow, there he goes. Wow! That looks like it hurts but like, in a good way? Does that even make sense? Wow, where did that vibrator even come from?"Yoongi grits his teeth. "Can you get out of here?" he hisses out. "Give me some privacy?""I gave you privacy all day, hyung," Hoseok whines, but he starts to drift upwards, towards the ceiling. "Whatever, fine. I'll go find something else to do, I can tell when I'm not wanted—"Yoongi closes his eyes, exhausted. A muscle in his forehead twitches, just above his eyebrow. He exhales slowly. "It's not that I don't want you," he says, "I just—" Hoseok just starts to laugh as he disappears through the ceiling. He starts to laugh, loud and boisterous, but it quickly morphs into an oddly muffled, pained sound, as if he's hurt himself somehow. Yoongi's eyes snap open as Hoseok whimpers.Sitting up, Yoongi snaps his laptop shut and tugs his boxers back up over his ass. He shifts on his knees on the bed, staring up at the ceiling. "Hoseok-ah?" he calls, hesitantly. It sounds almost like Hoseok's... crying up there. Yoongi's heart does a funny thing in his chest. "Are you okay? Look," he says, "look I didn't mean it. You can... We can hang out if you want, I—" Hoseok makes another soft, anguished sound, and Yoongi lurches towards his side table, catching himself on the edge before he topples off his bed and scooping up his phone to call Seokjin. It rings, but after a few moments, an unfamiliar voice answers. "Kim Seokjin's Curios and Conundrums, how may I help you?""Tell Seokjin he needs to get over here now," Yoongi says. "Hoseok's... Hoseokie's crying, I don't— I need help, please. Please. Tell Seokjin to come here. I need him. I'll... I'll owe him a favour, I'll do anything, please—""Jungkook-ah, what are you doing with my phone?" comes Seokjin's voice, distant and wavering over the line, but still loud enough to be heard. Yoongi hears a scuffle, and his eyes drift back to the ceiling. Hoseok's still sobbing, still out of sight up there, and Yoongi doesn't know what to do. "Yoongi-ssi?" Seokjin says after a moment's pause, sleek and slow. "To what do I owe the pleasure?"Yoongi swallows. "Let's skip the bullshit," he says, his eyes still fixed on the ceiling. "Hoseok's in trouble or hurt. I don't know. He drifted up into the ceiling above my bedroom and now he's crying and he won't come out. I need your help. I'll do whatever you want. Please."The line clicks, and the call ends. Yoongi stares at his phone. It slips from his grasp and he stands up on the bed. "Hoseok-ah, Hoseok-ah, what's going on? Where are you?" He wrings his hands together, his heartbeat pounding in his ears. "I'm sorry I was so short with you, I— hyung didn't mean it. Can you come back out?"Silence."...There's something in here," Hoseok whispers. His voice sounds small, cramped as if he's trapped in a small space. "...Hurts." He lets out another little whimper and Yoongi's heart clenches painfully.Small. Small space. Small space... Fuck, the attic crawl space above their apartment. The opening to it is in the closet. Yoongi scrambles towards the end of his bed, nearly tripping over the footboard and landing hard, hobbling as he hits the floor.He stumbles over to the closet and wrenches the door open. As he clambers up onto his dresser, shit gets knocked onto the floor in his haste, but he doesn't care, too desperate to get up to the false ceiling covering the opening into the crawl space. He pushes it up and in, standing on tiptoe to peer over the edge.Hoseok's curled up in the small square of space, scarcely big enough to store a pair of standard suitcases on their sides. Silvery tears glisten on his cheeks, his eyes clenched shut tight, back pressed against wooden support beams between the two stories. He hiccups and a couple more tears slip down Hoseok's cheeks from beneath his eyelids.Fuck. Yoongi reaches out for him. "Come here, Hoseok-ah," Yoongi says as softly as he can muster. "Come here, hyung's got you. Can you come over to me?""Hyung?" Hoseok asks, his eyes opening. More tears roll down his cheeks and he drifts towards Yoongi, through the opening. Yoongi follows after him and gets a better look at him. There're some sort of... burns on his skin, deep silvery welts dug into him, almost as if he were branded, somehow.Yoongi stares, bewildered. He reaches out without thinking, brushing his fingers over one of the nastier marks on Hoseok's arm. It passes right through him and Hoseok's entire form flickers. Yoongi's hand goes numb at once, prickling with pins and needles, and he shakes it. "Fuck," he hisses, "what happened to you?"Hoseok shakes his head. He stares at Yoongi for a moment, his eyes big and sad, tears still dripping off the edge of his face. Slowly his expression morphs, changing into something fierce and focused, and he zooms right past Yoongi, back up into the attic space. Yoongi yelps, reaching out for him, but his fingers close around nothing."Fuck!" Hoseok cries out again, pained, but he sounds furious now. Yoongi stares up at the hole in the ceiling, still half-crouched on top of his dresser. His erection from earlier starts to stir. Just a bit. A few moments later, Hoseok races back out, but there's something in his hands now — some sort of pendant dangling from a delicate silver chain. He drops it on the floor and Yoongi gets a better look at it: A small, circular stone the size of a one hundred won coin, set in the centre of a silver filigree pendant. The stone has swirls of green, purple, white and blue, almost like a galaxy, glimmering even half-in shadow on the floor.Yoongi hops down from his dresser, stooping down to get a better look at it. He seems almost... drawn to it, as if it's calling to him. There's some sort of whisper, the barest hint of a voice, unintelligible as if spoken from underwater. Low, constant. He leans closer. It sounds... almost familiar, almost as if he'd heard it somewhere else before. The voice seems to grow louder like it's drawn closer to the surface as his hand hovers over the pendant, but Yoongi still can't make sense of it. Something as pretty as that that stone... should be worn, shouldn't it? It should be admired. He should put it on. Just pick it up, and slip it on over his head. It would be so easy—"Don't fucking touch it," Hoseok says, sharp and cold. He cuts through the whisper, jolting Yoongi out of his trance. "It's silver, hyung. It'll hurt you even worse than me.""Oh," Yoongi says, his hand faltering. He's felt silver poisoning before and he's not keen to repeat the experience. The pull is still there, but not as strong now with Hoseok radiating more of a presence beside him. Yoongi stands, glancing over at Hoseok. The marks on his skin are beginning to fade even as Yoongi watches. Hoseok still looks livid and Yoongi's more turned on by that than he cares to examine at the moment. It's been months since he had a moment to get off last, and it's probably just to do with that. A stiff breeze would probably give him an erection, that's how hard up he is. It doesn't have anything to do with this annoying, and annoyingly attractive, ghost roommate he only met a month ago. No. That would be stupid."I called Seokjin," Yoongi grunts, stuffing one hand into the pocket of his hoodie as he stares down at the necklace on the floor. He scratches the back of his neck, pulling a face. "I assume he's on his way over. He likes you almost as much as he likes being the morally grey knight.""Good!" Hoseok says, a bright smile spreading across his face. Yoongi's dick seems to harden even more at the sight of it. God, he really needs to just get off already, this has gone far beyond embarrassing and is hurtling towards pathetic. "Good," Hoseok says again, bending down to look at the necklace. "Seokjinnie should look at this. He'll know what to do with it." Bending closer, Hoseok pokes at the stone with a fingertip. His expression goes oddly blank as he makes contact with it. Yoongi can't quite put a finger on what changes, but it's... it's almost as if there's someone else there, all of a sudden. It's the strangest feeling because it's still clearly Hoseok, but Yoongi almost gets a sense of something else... of an also. The whisper reaches Yoongi's ear once again, like a frigid breeze rippling across the surface of a still pond. It seems pleased. Yoongi shudders.Hoseok grins up at Yoongi, scooping the necklace into his hands and bouncing it between them as if he were playing with something hot. "Ooh," he hisses, laughing as he turns towards the door. "Ooh, ow. I'll put this in a safe place until Seokjinnie gets here. Thank you, hyung." Yoongi watches him leave, sagging back and perching on the footboard of his bed, exhausted. What the fuck was that all about? He shivers again, climbing back up into his bed, and he drifts off into an uneasy sleep. Later, long after Seokjin's arrival, Yoongi wakes. He clambers to his feet, tugging on a pair of sweatpants as he unlocks his bedroom door and creeps out into the hall. Seokjin and Hoseok are sitting in the living room together, by the windows. He stays just out of sight to eavesdrop."It's good that you found this, Hoseokie," Seokjin says. Yoongi peers around the corner. Seokjin's examining the stone with a keen eye. "If it was over Yoongi's bed, prolonged exposure to the silver probably would've killed him."Hoseok shrugs, a pensive look on his face. His body flickers a bit, leaning back against the windowsill with his arms crossed over his chest. "It was the weirdest feeling," he says, after a moment. "...But I think that thing wanted to stay hidden, hyung."Seokjin mutters something under his breath and the necklace hangs in the air unsuspended before him. "Strange," he continues. "From what I can tell, it's... Not dangerous, beyond it being silver. It's a very strong protective amulet, nothing evil or interesting about it. But..." He frowns. The stone catches the light, flecks of gold and silver shimmering deep inside of it. "Looks can be deceiving. You didn't see anything else in the attic?" Hoseok shakes his head, and Seokjin's frown deepens. "Can I keep this? To study?"Hoseok shrugs. "Not a lot of good it'll do here," he says. He reaches out and grips the pendant and grimaces, letting out a whimper of pain. Yoongi's heart leaps in his chest, his hand gripping around the doorframe until his knuckles go white. Slowly Hoseok's fingers unfurl, and he tilts his palm towards Seokjin, showing him the deep welt branded deep into his skin. "It just burns me." "Strange," Seokjin repeats. He snatches the necklace out of the air and stuffs it back into his pocket. "I'll give it back in a few days. Hey, Yoongi-yah," he calls, and Yoongi startles. There's a twitch, a harsh tug somewhere between his shoulder blades and he stumbles forward into the living room. "Nice of you to finally join us."Yoongi swallows hard, dread sinking in his gut like a stone falling into a pit of snakes. "Yeah. Look, what do I... I know what I promised to get you here. What do you want from me? Let's just get it over with."Seokjin smiles. "I don't need anything from you now, Yoongi-yah. I'll let you know when your services will be most useful to me. In the meantime, I've done a thorough check of the entire building and this is the only thing that poses a threat. I've added a few more wards to your apartment, it should give you some tranquility and peace of mind.""I guess," Yoongi grumbles, shifting on his feet, his guts still churning. He can't help but feel he just signed his soul away. "Thanks, hyung."

When one of Yoongi's favourite songs comes up on shuffle during a lapse in conversation, he doesn't miss the way Hoseok's eyes light up. Beaming, Hoseok hops up off the couch and shimmies his shoulders along to the beat. Yoongi, still sprawled across the couch with his elbow propped up on the armrest beside him, tries to hide his smile behind his hand."Dance with me, hyung," Hoseok says.Yoongi expects him to be talking to Seokjin and startles when Hoseok's socked toes enter his peripheral vision. He looks up to see Hoseok holding his hand out towards Yoongi, a softer smile gracing his face. The orange glow of the sunset streams through the thin curtains, casting the room in a vibrant orange that catches on Hoseok's edges and sets him alight with a bronze fire that takes Yoongi's breath away."Hyung," Hoseok repeats, and he tilts his head to the side. "Dance with me."He would never say no.Reaching out, Yoongi laces his fingers between Hoseok's, and he allows himself to be hauled up to his feet. He stumbles into Hoseok's chest and Hoseok laughs, warm breath puffing across Yoongi's cheek as his arms wrap tightly around his waist. Yoongi curses under his breath, staring down at the floor and backing up a step. Hoseok leads Yoongi through the song, simple steps around and around the living room table. By the final chorus of the song, Yoongi's loosened up some, enough to mimic more of Hoseok's steps rather than following along robotically, too nervous to try. If possible, Hoseok's smile seems to grow even sweeter.From the couch, Seokjin cheers and offers encouragement and requests in equal measure. Their dancing through the following song and the next seems to grow sillier and sillier with each passing second. Hoseok's giggles are infectious, bright and ringing even above the music. Yoongi ducks his head to hide a smile, shaking his head with a little laugh, his hands flexing around Hoseok's waist."I'll be right back," Seokjin calls over the music, getting to his feet. "Anyone want drinks while I'm up?""Tea, please," Hoseok replies, smiling at Seokjin over Yoongi's shoulder. "Thank you, hyung."Yoongi hesitates until he hears Seokjin say his name. "...Could you get me another beer, hyung?" he asks, turning his head until he catches a glimpse of the older man, leaning against the half-wall dividing the open kitchen and living room. "Thank you."Hoseok draws Yoongi closer, taking hold of both his hands before pushing him back with a little twirl. Yoongi stumbles over his own feet, caught off guard, but he recovers. He attempts to do the same for Hoseok, standing on his toes with his arms stretched so high over his head their fingers barely connect. Hoseok twirls gracefully, beautifully, and he falls back into Yoongi's arms with a laugh."You're getting good at this, hyung," he whispers."I'm not," Yoongi protests, but he can't help the swell of pride in his chest. At the end of the song, Yoongi dips Hoseok with a huge, dramatic flair. Hoseok grips Yoongi's arms as he bends backward with a delighted shout. As he straightens back up, both laughing and breathless, Yoongi kisses him, soft. Hoseok makes a pleased sound in the back of his throat, his hand curling around the nape of Yoongi's neck to pull him closer. They stay close as the next song begins, breathing into each other's mouths, and Yoongi loses all sense of time.They break apart when they hear Seokjin's voice from behind them. "Where do you want me to put your drinks?" Turning, Yoongi sees Seokjin standing near the couch with a cup of steaming tea in one hand and two beers clutched in the other. He doesn't look mad, but he doesn't look pleased, either.Yoongi's heart plummets like a stone for what feels like six feet. He gasps out an apology, releasing Hoseok as if he'd been electrocuted and trying to step away. Hoseok doesn't let him, though, slinging his arms back around Yoongi's middle.Seokjin sets the beer bottles and the cup of tea down onto the side table and comes closer. "What's wrong?" he asks."I— we—" Yoongi stammers and he never stammers, but he can't meet either of their eyes. His hands hang limply at his sides, prickling with cold, nervous sweat. "We kissed, hyung, I— I'm sorry—"The sound of Seokjin's squeaking laughter cutting through the roaring in Yoongi's ears is the last thing he expects to hear. His heart thuds a rapid tattoo against his ribs as he chances a glance up towards Seokjin's face. He's smiling. Seokjin curls his arms around both of them. He tips Hoseok's face towards him with a flick of his fingertips, kissing him full on the mouth. Hoseok hums into the kiss, his fingers curling into the loose fabric of Yoongi's t-shirt. Seokjin pulls away with a final peck on Hoseok's lips, before he turns to kiss Yoongi's temple."I like it when you kiss him," Seokjin murmurs against Yoongi's skin. He draws back just enough to meet Yoongi's eyes. "Okay? I— I'd like it if you'd kiss me, too, if you want.""I do," Yoongi breathes. "I— both of you. All the time."Hoseok laughs, sweet and bright. "That's a good start," he says, and he leans up to kiss Seokjin once more. Yoongi watches with his mouth hanging slightly open, warmth flooding his cheeks. Hoseok's smile takes on a more wicked edge when he catches Yoongi at it, and a shiver rustles down Yoongi's spine. Still smiling, Hoseok leans forward, catching Yoongi's mouth. Yoongi's hands curl into Hoseok's and Seokjin's shirts, keeping them both.

Chapter Notes
warnings for mild nervousness about shifting dynamics and changing boundaries, nothing major. it's very mild.for the prompt: cooking together



Over the solid thunk, thunk of the knife hitting the cutting board, Yoongi can hear breathless giggles and squeals of delight as his daughter uses furniture like playground equipment. He glances up from the pots heating on the stove, watching as Hoseok chases Jihye around and around in the middle of the living room. His eyes are bright and dancing, a grin stretched across his face. Hoseok snatches Jihye around the middle as she prepares to leap off the back of the couch, lifting her up into the air. She lets out a high-pitched scream of laughter, kicking her feet as Hoseok twirls her around the living room again. The moment he lets her down she races out of the room and away, her little feet thundering down the hall. Hoseok waits to catch his breath before giving chase.Yoongi ducks his head with a smile. Beside him, Seokjin continues chopping as if his boyfriend ran toddlers around their pocket-sized two bedroom apartment every day. Distantly, Yoongi can make out his daughter's giggling and Hoseok's amused, if startled, yelp. Seokjin looks up and meets Yoongi's gaze. They smile at each other and continue on. Every now and then they exchange little pleasantries, but remain more focused on making dinner together than having an actual conversation. That suits Yoongi well enough, and he knows that if Seokjin has something he needs to say, he'll say it."I like being here like this," Yoongi murmurs, almost inaudible over the sizzle of meat cooking in the pan. "With you and Hoseokie. It's comfortable.""I'm glad," Seokjin says, coming closer with two handfuls of chopped onion to add to the pan. "We like having you here, too. Hoseokie and I have talked about it before, you know, how much more complete it feels with you here, Yoongi-yah."Yoongi feels a little thrill in his gut and he turns his head away to hide a smile. "I hope we can do this a lot more often in the future," he admits. "With Jihye on weekends and... With me, on other days, if you want."A pause. Yoongi's heart thumps against his ribs. after a moment, Seokjin sets his knife down beside the chopping board and reaches out to touch Yoongi's shoulder. "Trust me, Hoseokie and I have talked about that at length," he says, and a grin stretches across his face as Yoongi meets his gaze. "We want you here, Yoongi-yah.""Well," Yoongi exhales, letting his smile grow for a moment before ducking his head away and focusing on cooking. "That's good to know."Seokjin leans against the counter by the stove while Yoongi cooks. He doesn't say much, just stares through the gap between the countertops and overhead counters to the empty living room. It's a comfortable silence and Yoongi's heart rate begins to slow. Distantly, he can hear Jihye's giggling and Hoseok's low voice from one of the other rooms. He stirs the pots, double-checking to make sure everything cooks through. Too soon, that silence is broken as Jihye runs back into the living room with Hoseok on her heels, his hands outstretched. She glances back over her shoulder at him and shrieks with laughter. Her feet pound against the tile floors and Yoongi hopes the neighbours aren't home to hear it. Jihye dodges Hoseok and makes a beeline for the kitchen.Yoongi spots her at once. "No! Out, my little monster, you know better," he chastises. "It's not safe in here while dad's cooking." Jihye carefully backtracks, her hands held up before her in claws as she growls at him, pulling obscene faces that just makes Yoongi laugh. Jihye pulls one of the chairs back from the counter opposite from the stove and climbs up onto it. She sprawls across the counter. "Daddy," she begins with the barest hint of a pout. "Daddy, I'm getting kind of hungry. Can I have something to eat?""No, Jihye-yah," Yoongi replies, shaking his head. "You have to wait. Dinner's almost ready. Why don't you keep playing with Hoseokie?""But daddy—!" Yoongi can hear in her voice how much she's winding up for a tantrum. "I said no, Jihye-yah," Yoongi repeats. "It's only another twenty minutes left until dinner. You'll ruin your appetite if you eat now."Hoseok edges around the corner into the kitchen, pulling the fridge door open. He reaches inside. The next time Yoongi looks up from the stove, his daughter is munching on a bowl of sliced strawberries leftover from lunch with an opened juicebox resting at her elbow, the straw dripping apple juice onto the counter.Yoongi shoots Hoseok a glare. "If she doesn't have room for a proper dinner, you have to sleep on the couch tonight." In lieu of a response, Hoseok simply winks at Yoongi and leads Jihye back out of the room, carrying the juice box for her. Heaving a sigh, Yoongi turns back to the stove. "You know," Seokjin says quietly, reaching out for the abandoned bowl of strawberries and popping one of the slices into his mouth. "I noticed some bruising on Hoseokie's thighs when we took a shower together this morning and didn't remember putting them there... Was that one of yours?""Oh." Yoongi's gut clenches and he glances at Seokjin sidelong. He swallows. "...Yes," he makes himself say after a long pause. "We fooled around a bit after you went to bed early last night." He catches his lip between the teeth, forcing his attention back onto the food. "...Is that a problem, hyung?"Seokjin makes a startled noise, touching Yoongi's shoulder again. "No! No, of course not, I—" He heaves a sigh and pushes himself up to sit on the counter beside Yoongi. Yoongi watches him, wary. "It's... It's good for you to have time alone together," he says after a moment. "Just like Hoseokie and I do. You're in a relationship with him, too. You know what I mean?" he asks, looking up and meeting Yoongi's gaze. "I don't always have to be there when you two want to be intimate, if you don't want me to be. In fact, it's probably healthier to have that sort of one-on-one separation sometimes."Yoongi tries not to stare, but this wasn't what he expected. Time and again, both Hoseok and Seokjin kept finding new ways to surprise him. He'd expected jealousy, or a promise to make sure that Seokjin was present the next time, but... Not this. "Yeah," Yoongi says, trying to keep his jaw from dropping in stunned surprise. "Yeah, sure, hyung. That makes sense."Seokjin falls quiet again for a bit. Was that all he had to say? Yoongi shifts uncomfortably, switching his attention between pots and pans as he adds ingredients and removes other items from the heat. That was weird, but Seokjin can be weird sometimes. It's not a big deal. shaking his head, Yoongi finishes cooking dinner."Hey," Seokjin begins again, voice soft but thoughtful. "Have you ever noticed Hoseokie putting on more of a show when he's with the two of us?" Yoongi looks up at Seokjin, switching off the stove elements. "It's subtle, but he's different when we're all together compared to when he's alone with me... I don't know, is he like that with you?"Yoongi frowns, thinking back to the previous encounters in the few nights he's spent here with Hoseok and Seokjin. "A bit," he says. "Now that you mention it, he's always trying to maintain a mood when we're all together. I guess... you're right, last night he was a bit more subdued. More present with me, almost."Seokjin nods, an expression of relief crossing his face. "He's been saying that he wants some alone time with you lately," he says. "I think that would be a good idea." Humming in agreement, Yoongi empties the pots and pans into serving dishes and sets everything out onto the counter. Once that's finished, Seokjin catches hold of Yoongi's hand, and Yoongi finds himself drawn right up against the edge of the counter between Seokjin's spread knees. "Oh," he breathes. "Hi."Smiling, Seokjin bends closer, just enough for his lips to graze Yoongi's ear. Yoongi tries not to shiver. "I think we should get some one-on-one time together, too. What do you think?"Yoongi doesn't even try to hide the shudder that rolls down his spine this time. He leans back just enough to meet Seokjin's eyes and nods, his lip caught between his teeth. Seokjin eases it free with his lips, bringing Yoongi closer for a proper kiss.

Chapter Notes
nothing to warn for. for the prompt picnic and camera



Hoseok and Jihye nap together on the picnic blanket, in the dappled sunlight filtering through the leaves of the tree overhead. They're both worn out from chasing each other around in the park near Hoseok's and Seokjin's apartment building, eyes bright with laughter and love. As soon as Jihye started rubbing at her eyes with her little fists, Hoseok scooped the girl into his arms, carrying her over to the blanket. They fell asleep with Hoseok sprawled on his back and Jihye half curled beside him, her head pillowed in the crook of his arm.Yoongi raises his camera to take a picture, his heart warming as he focuses on the way Jihye's hand grips the front of Hoseok's shirt. The flower crowns Hoseok made earlier sit precariously atop their heads, the stems of the flowers starting to come undone, petals caught in their hair.Seokjin sits beside Yoongi, his face tilted up towards the sun, eyes closed. Yoongi leans away just enough to snap another photo. Seokjin blinks his eyes open, turning his head and squinting through the sunlight at Yoongi, the corner of his mouth lifting, and Yoongi takes another photo."Cute," Yoongi says."Obviously," Seokjin replies, ruffling a hand through his hair. He shoots Yoongi a sultry, smoldering look. Snorting, Yoongi takes another picture and turns the camera around so Seokjin can see. "Ah, it amazes me every day how handsome I am," Seokjin says. "How do the rest of you even deal, seeing me all the time?""Honey, I've seen you walk around with your underwear tugged up under your armpits," comes Hoseok's voice, slow and meandering from sleep. His eyes are still closed, but he runs his fingers absently through Jihye's hair. "Remembering that helps temper it a bit."Seokjin scoffs, but Yoongi watches the soft expression in his eyes as he looks back towards Hoseok. "I only ever do stuff like that to make you laugh," he sighs. "Aren't you lucky?"Hoseok's cheeks dimple as he smiles, nuzzling his cheek against the blanket. "I am, aren't I," he replies softly, breath evening out as he drifts back to sleep. Yoongi takes another picture, capturing that smile before his face relaxes. "I'm pretty lucky, too," Yoongi murmurs, just loudly enough for Seokjin to hear. The older man glances over at him with a smile, and Yoongi meets his eyes, reaching out and brushing his fingers across the back of Seokjin's hand. Seokjin's smile softens, warm and fond, as he turns his hand to lace his fingers between Yoongi's. "You know, I think we all are."

        See the end of the chapter for more notes




The arcade looks different in the light of the morning - the cavernous room still dark, of course, with its low ceilings and dark walls and carpeted floors. It seems almost more real, somehow, empty of customers and vulnerable with all its imperfections highlighted by the sunlight streaming through the windows. The stains on the carpet, the dents and scratches on the arcade games, the chipped paint on the walls. Yoongi likes it.He looks around the room, letting his gaze linger on Seokjin and Hoseok. They're both still sleep-rumpled from a night spent in the back of Seokjin's truck, hair mussed, lips kiss-swollen, bruises starting to flush a darker red across their necks, hidden beneath their wrinkled clothes. Yoongi likes that even more."Should we even be here this early?" Seokjin asks, glancing towards the clock hanging over the locked glass doors. The arcade is due to open in an hour. Hoseok shrugs with a little smile. "It's fine," he says, pocketing his keys and walking past them. "Want to help me get ready?" he asks.Together they go through the motions of setting up the arcade for a day's use; plugging things in, doing basic cleaning, all the little things they didn't quite get finished the night before when they left.With that done, Seokjin crowds Hoseok up against one of the game consoles just barely out of view from the windows and kisses him like a reward for finishing. Hoseok's startled gasp gets swallowed up in Seokjin's mouth, his arms sliding around Seokjin's shoulders. He lets out a quiet little whine, pulling him closer.Yoongi wanders over to the doors to peer outside; the street seems fairly quiet. A few people walk past, some dressed in business suits on their way to work. He glances back over his shoulder as he hears Hoseok let out another weak sound, a grin stretching across his face at the sight. Seokjin's got Hoseok pinned to the little ledge of the game console with his hips between Hoseok's thighs, both his hands buried in Hoseok's hair. Hoseok clings to Seokjin's broad shoulders like a lifeline. He wraps his legs tighter around Seokjin's hips."Hey, hey," Yoongi says as he makes his way back over to them. "Don't get too carried away, now. You know we have to leave soon."Hoseok pulls back from Seokjin's kiss, blinking his eyes open as his beautiful mouth twitches down into a pout. Letting go of Seokjin's shoulder, he reaches out for Yoongi's instead. his fingers clench in the collar of Yoongi's t-shirt and Yoongi lets himself be dragged forward, standing up on his tiptoes in his ratty old sneakers to reach Hoseok's mouth.It takes him by surprise how desperately Hoseok kisses him, the scrape of his nails dulled by the thin jersey fabric of his shirt. Yoongi surges forward into it, cupping the nape of Hoseok's neck in his hand, tilting his head up to deepen the kiss. When he draws back from the kiss to catch his breath, Yoongi sees Seokjin with his hand tucked into the front of Hoseok's jeans, rubbing at his cock."We don't have time for this," he whispers, but he doesn't stop them. How could he? The very idea is abhorrent. He tilts his head back up to kiss Hoseok's open mouth, breathing in his gasps and soft moans. He trails kisses down the side of Hoseok's neck as he throws his head back, rocking back on his heels to watch Seokjin work Hoseok over until he's a squirming, gasping mess. Both his hands are tangled in Seokjin's and Yoongi's hair now, clenching tight as his hips roll up to meet the tight curl of Seokjin's fist with choked off little noises, his head tipped back.Yoongi presses his mouth to Seokjin's shoulder. He rises up on his toes to pepper kisses along his jaw, nuzzling in until Seokjin turns his head to kiss him properly. "Keep going," Yoongi whispers into Seokjin's mouth. "Keep going, fuck, just look at him—" Hoseok whimpers, a flush spreading across his cheeks and eyelids fluttering shut, bottom lip caught between his teeth. "Fuck, he's so beautiful, hyung..."Hoseok makes another strangled sound, his nails scraping across the nape of Yoongi's neck. "Someone kiss me," he gasps out, his bitten lip swollen and pink. "Someone kiss me now." Seokjin sways forward before Yoongi can even move, licking into Hoseok's mouth. Hoseok's hips buck up against Seokjin pinning him to the game console, his frustrated whines muffled. His grip in Yoongi's hair tightens and loosens. Yoongi grinds up against his leg spread wide by Seokjin's hips, and Hoseok lets out a loud moan.Hoseok gets come all over his shirt.Yoongi heaves a sigh, stripping his own t-shirt off and passing it over for Hoseok to change into without a word. Hoseok's blush deepens with a sheepish little smile. He slides off the console ledge, ducking in to kiss Yoongi's cheek before pulling the clean shirt on. "Thanks, hyung," Hoseok murmurs. The shirt's rumpled and stinks from the night they had, but at least there isn't jizz all over the front of it."Yeah, yeah," Yoongi grumbles, flipping Hoseok's shirt inside out and shrugging into it. Hoseok's come is tacky and stiffening as it dries, sticking to Yoongi's skin. He'll shower as soon as he gets home.Seokjin kisses Hoseok again, softer, sweeter, his hand curved around the nape of Hoseok's neck and tipping his head up. Hoseok sighs into his mouth, tucking his hands into the back pockets of Seokjin's jeans. "We'll see you after work," Seokjin promises, pecking the tip of Hoseok's nose before he pulls away.Hoseok nods, smiling. "See you in ten hours," he says, turning to pull Yoongi closer by the grip he gets in the front of his shirt to kiss him goodbye, too. Yoongi hums, pleased, finger-combing through Hoseok's hair before he steps back, making him look more presentable. Hoseok ducks away with a bashful grin, "Thanks, hyung." He unlocks the door to let Yoongi and Seokjin out, waving to them from the doorway. Seokjin and Yoongi stand there, watching as Hoseok turns away and disappears back inside. After a few moments, the lights begin to switch on, flashing neons spilling through the windows. Yoongi shoves his hands deeper into his jeans pockets. He's exhausted, but he doesn't want to sleep alone. not now. "Wanna come back to my place?" he asks."Your air con still broken?" Seokjin counters. Yoongi just sighs at him in response and the corner of Seokjin's mouth twitches with amusement. "Come to mine, then," Seokjin offers. "My parents should be out for the day by now, we'll have the place to ourselves." A real grin stretches across his face. "We could snuggle a bit, get off... Send some photos to torture Hoseokie. He'd like that." They grin at each other and make their way over to Seokjin's truck parked up the street, and head out.

Even as the door swings shut behind Seokjin's mother, on her way out to a doctor's appointment and to run a few errands, Seokjin finds himself reaching out for Hoseok. He turns towards Hoseok on the couch. His mother will be gone for at least four to six hours that Seokjin plans to take full advantage of. "I thought she'd never leave," he murmurs."Jeez, hyung," Hoseok whispers with a half-smile turning up the corner of his mouth as Seokjin curls his arm around Hoseok's waist. His breath hitches as Seokjin jerks him close, belying his teasing tone. "Eager, are you?"Seokjin reaches up with his other hand, thumbing at Hoseok's chin, at his bottom lip. Hoseok's eyes go hazy, his mouth falling open as he wets his lips with a quick swipe of his tongue. His gaze darts from Seokjin's mouth to his eyes and back again."A little," Seokjin admits in a murmur, leaning in. Hoseok cups the back of Seokjin's head in his hand, stroking his hair. The kiss is chaste, simple, no more than Hoseok's bottom lip caught between both of Seokjin's as they press against each other with a gentle pressure. Somehow to Seokjin, it's almost like a sudden rush of fresh air after holding his breath for what seems like hours. It's only been a few days since he was last able to kiss Hoseok, and yet it feels like it's been an eternity.Seokjin doesn't know how this happened, how Hoseok's lips became some sort of addiction, but he's here now. He can't imagine anything different.Hoseok sighs into Seokjin's mouth, shifting closer. He tips his head to the side and Seokjin lets his palm skim the side of Hoseok's neck before curling about his nape and deepening the kiss. Hoseok gives a pleased hum in response, his lips parting as Seokjin traces them with the tip of his tongue. His fingers curl in Seokjin's hair, a gentle graze of his nails that sends a pleasant tingle across Seokjin's scalp.The kisses take on a different edge as Seokjin starts to lie back on the couch. Hoseok follows after Seokjin's lips eagerly, climbing on top of him without hesitation. Each press of their lips stays soft, sweet, but there's a faint, exciting stirring of more lingering under the surface, like neither of them can get enough.Seokjin nips at Hoseok's bottom lip, tongue sweeping across afterward almost at once to soothe the sting. Hoseok's breaths get a little shaky. He cups Seokjin's jaw in his palms and kisses him again, deeper. Seokjin lets his hands drift up and down Hoseok's back, following the length of his spine through the whisper-thin fabric of his tank top, feeling the shift of muscle beneath Hoseok's skin as he moves on top of Seokjin.He pushes up into the next kiss, and Hoseok shivers, one of his hands slipping back to curl around the nape of Seokjin's neck. Seokjin catches Hoseok's lip between his teeth again, sucking on it for a moment before letting it go with a slick pop. His hands drop to cup the curve of Hoseok's ass in his palms, squeezing gently. "Fuck," Hoseok gasps.There's a sudden draft of cool air between them as Hoseok sits up in Seokjin's lap, and Seokjin's hands slide to the front of Hoseok's thighs. Hoseok's fingers curl in the hem of his tank and he hauls it up over his head, mussing his auburn hair. He drops his shirt on the floor, reaching up to push his hair out of his eyes. Seokjin can only stare up at him for a moment as the haze of mid-afternoon August sunlight streaming through the window washes his skin in a golden glow and sets the red tones in his hair ablaze.Hoseok smiles as he catches Seokjin's lingering gaze, tipping his head down. The tips of his ears flush a dusky pink even as Seokjin watches. A softer shade of that same colour washes across his cheeks. He shifts back down over Seokjin and Seokjin's lips part in anticipation of another kiss, only Hoseok turns his head to the side just before their mouths touch. Seokjin feels a swoop in his gut, his hands smoothing up Hoseok's thighs as Hoseok peppers kisses across Seokjin's cheek, following his bone structure towards his ear. He sucks the lobe into his mouth.Seokjin sighs, sliding his hands up to Hoseok's hipbones and further up his back, spreading his legs apart on the couch and pushing up against Hoseok's ass. He can feel himself starting to get hard now, already, just from a few minutes of making out. It's almost embarrassing how well Hoseok's learned to push all his buttons so quickly, after only a handful of hours spent fooling around. Hoseok rolls his hips in Seokjin's lap, huffing a breath more air than sound against Seokjin's ear. He kisses down Seokjin's neck, nipping and sucking at his skin, but not hard enough to leave any noticeable mark behind. Unfortunate, really. Seokjin half-wants to tell Hoseok to do it anyway, his office job be damned.With his fingers working at the top buttons of Seokjin's shirt, Hoseok kisses his way across Seokjin's collar bones. He follows the path of skin the shirt reveals as each button slips free from its hole, kissing the centre of Seokjin's chest. Inch by agonizing inch, he makes his way down. Each brush of his lips feels electric, sending little shivery, sparking jolts in his wake. Seokjin gasps for breath, squirming, his back arching up off the couch towards Hoseok's mouth. He can feel Hoseok's grin against his oversensitive skin.Hoseok pauses at Seokjin's hips with the final button unfastened and his shirt pushed out of the way to pool around his abdomen. He spends a few moments laving his tongue along Seokjin's hipbones and nipping at them. For a wild moment, Seokjin thinks Hoseok might keep going down, slowly liberating Seokjin from all of his clothes and covering him with nothing but searing kisses. Instead, Hoseok comes back up, retracing his path all the way back up Seokjin's chest. He goes just as slow as he made his way down, and Seokjin can't help a little grunt of frustration. Hoseok must be able to tell how hard he is by now, with a semi pushing at the front of his shorts. This isn't fair."Hoseok-ah," Seokjin begins. "Come on, I—" Seokjin's voice stutters into a gasp at the first flick of a tongue across his nipple. He tips his head back, his eyes clenching shut as Hoseok fastens his mouth over Seokjin's chest and sucks, hard, his tongue and teeth grazing his skin in equal measure until Seokjin is left a breathless, squirming mess underneath him. Hoseok gives the other nipple a similar treatment, but rubs circles over the first with his thumb, soft and almost too much.Hoseok resumes his path of kisses, sucking at the base of Seokjin's neck and dragging his tongue up the side of his throat. He nips at Seokjin's jaw and Seokjin makes a weak noise. His nipples have always been sensitive, and ever since Hoseok made that discovery, he's jumped at every opportunity to use this knowledge to his advantage.It's good.It's all so new that there's always a thrill to doing this. Even more so in places where they could get caught so easily — in the middle of the arcade after hours, in the neon-lit alley behind Yoongi's run-down apartment building, in the backseat of his truck, or even in full view of a door. His parents are out, but there's still a chance, however slim, that either of them could come back early.Seokjin loses himself in Hoseok's kisses, surging up into the next one, his hands skimming Hoseok's sides. Hoseok squirms in Seokjin's lap, ticklish. He huffs a breathy laugh into Seokjin's mouth, and Seokjin couldn't stop smiling even if he wanted to. Hoseok licks deeper into Seokjin's mouth, tongue soft and wet as it slides alongside Seokjin's. He keeps up a slow pattern of circles around either of Seokjin's nipples with his thumbs, at turns feather-light grazes or firm, teasing flicks. Seokjin gasps for breath, his toes curling into the couch cushion. He can feel Hoseok starting to get hard now, too. They move and shift against each other, Hoseok grinding down and swiveling in little circles to meet each upward thrust of Seokjin's hips. Still, they make no real moves towards touching each other beneath their clothes. Each soft moan and gasp is muffled into each other's mouths, and they don't pull away from each other to breathe for even a second's pause. Seokjin finally gets his mouth on Hoseok's ear and Hoseok makes a strangled, startled noise."Not fair," Hoseok mutters, grinding down on Seokjin even harder. Seokjin just laughs, breathless and wincing from the rough drag of his boxers across his sensitive cock. "Turn about's fair play," he murmurs, nipping at Hoseok's earlobe.Somehow they miss the rattle of a key in the lock, caught wholly unaware when the door swings open.Hoseok squawks and topples off the edge of the sofa. He lands on the floor with a loud thump and yelp of pain, clutching at his ear where Seokjin accidentally bit him in surprise.Seokjin's heart pounds in his throat, his eyes wide and unblinking. Fuck. He tries to sink into the plush leather couch cushion. Is it his mother? Did she forget something? FUCK.There's no sound, aside from a soft jingling. Cautiously, Seokjin rolls over to belly-crawl towards the arm of the couch. He peers over it. Shock, relief and followed quickly by a jolt of annoyance surge up inside of him as he sees Min Yoongi standing there in the doorway with an empty hallway behind him, twirling Seokjin's Super Mario mushroom charm keyring around his index finger.A cat-like grin spreads across Yoongi's face. Seokjin collapses back on the couch with a groan.Hoseok scuffles on the cold tile floor with soft noises of distress that sound as if they're bordering on genuine panic, as he attempts to unstick himself from where he got stuck half-under the couch when he'd rolled himself underneath it in a desperate attempt to hide."Fuck's sake," Seokjin says. "You nearly gave me a heart attack, Yoongi-yah." He scrubs a hand over his face, sparing a moment to mourn his rapidly shriveled erection. He sighs. "Hoseok-ah... You okay?" he asks."Fuckin'— no," Hoseok manages to get out between grunts and little squeaks. "No, I'm— fuck— not—" he collapses against the floor with a huff, breathing heavily. "I'm trapped, hyung. Help.""Why were you two fooling around right where anyone could just walk in and see you?" Yoongi asks, sounding far more amused than Seokjin feels this situation warrants. The door swings shut as he steps into the apartment. He pauses to kick off his sneakers and drop his jacket on the floor. "It's like you were just begging to get caught. Lucky it was only me at the door and not someone in charge of your trust fund." Yoongi pauses for a moment, and Seokjin peeks over the arm of the couch to see Yoongi's grin soften into an almost thoughtful expression. "You know, this exhibition kink of yours is going to get us all in trouble one day.""This is all your fault, anyway," Hoseok replies sulkily, and Seokjin watches Hoseok's arm wiggle a bit in defeat on the floor. "Eat my ass, hyung.""Sure, if you want me to," Yoongi replies, totally deadpan. Hoseok makes another embarrassed little squawk and he tries to roll back underneath the couch. Yoongi and Seokjin crack up. "Hey," Yoongi manages between huffs of laughter as he approaches and crouches down beside the sofa, "Hey, I don't think there's room for both of us under there, Hoseok-ah. Come on," he says, a bit softer, a bit cajoling. He reaches out a hand, which Hoseok takes, after a moment's pause. "We'll help you."



yoon2seok / arcade
Chapter Summary
hoseok expects a rather uneventful summer when he agrees to take a job at his uncle's struggling arcade — until he catches the eye of two regular customers, that is.
Chapter Notes
nothing really to warn for. public makeouts, some hurt feelings and miscommunicationsfor the arcade au, featuring arcade attendant!hoseok, pizza maker!yoongi, and rebellious chaebol!seokjin. for the prompt: a surprise kissnote: this takes place before the other installments of arcade au, back before they got their shit together. it takes them a bit, but they do all get on the same page, i promise



The sun-baked pavement radiates heat even hours after sunset. Hoseok sits perched on a curb, cradling a large, greasy slice of pizza in both hands as if it is the most precious thing he's held in days. It might well be. He hasn't taken a bite yet.Hoseok looks up as Yoongi settles beside him on the curb with a loud groan, resting his elbows on his splayed knees. He can't help but smile, even when Yoongi glances over at him. The smile doesn't fade, despite the blush warming his cheeks. "What," Yoongi grunts, ducking his head and scratching at the nape of his neck.Hoseok turns his attention back to the pizza and takes a bite. It's still too hot, the cheese burning the roof of his mouth, but it's glorious. He moans a bit, licking grease from his lips. "God, hyung," he breathes out to try and cool his mouth, muffled through a mouthful of hot pizza. "You have a gift."Yoongi's smirking, when Hoseok glances over at him again after swallowing his first bite. "In more ways than one," he says. "I'm what you might call... a jack of all trades.""Okay at some things, master of fuck-nothing?" Hoseok teases. He blows cool air across the pizza for a moment before diving in for a second bite. Somehow it's even better than the first, despite decimating several of his taste buds. "Excuse you, I have a master level skill for many things," Yoongi replies with a laugh more huffed air than sound. He counts off on his fingers, "Pizza. Basketball. AutoCAD. Budgeting. Curating playlists to suit any mood. Making surprisingly good meals out of whatever shit I've got kicking around in the fridge. Bullshitting my way through any situation. Good with my hands," here he flutters his fingers and raises his eyebrows simultaneously. Hoseok snorts with amusement. Yoongi continues with great dignity, "Beating Seokjin's ass at Space Invaders. Making cute boys fall for me—""Hyung!" Hoseok turns from his pizza to scowl at Yoongi, but he feels the corner of his mouth twitching upwards irresistibly when he sees the open, happy expression on Yoongi's face. "Hyung, did you trip Jungkookie again?" The words escape him on a chuckle, and he clamps his lips together to try and hold his amusement in check."No!" Yoongi says. He pauses. "Well..."Hoseok nudges Yoongi in the ribs with his elbow, shaking his head and letting his laughter spill past his lips. "You're ridiculous." Yoongi just hums agreeably and the corner of Hoseok's mouth twitches again. He takes another bite of pizza to try and smother it, taking his time to thoroughly chew and swallow, getting a tighter rein on his heart so he doesn't get carried away so easily. "Missed you at the arcade today," he says, after a moment's pause. "How was that school thing?""Fine," Yoongi says, a bit too quick. Hoseok turns on him with raised eyebrows, and Yoongi has the decency to look sheepish. "It was okay," he mutters, bowing his head and scuffing the soles of his sneakers across the street as he stretches his legs out in front of him. "It's just weird, is all," he continues. "Feels kind of like growing up, but it's too fast. My advisor has a lot of expectations for me for my final semester. I don't know if I'll be able to meet them. I don't know if I'll graduate on time."Hoseok stares down at his beat-up sneakers. He doesn't let himself think about how, this time last summer, he'd expected to be starting his final year, too. He doesn't let himself think about how he'd had to drop down to part-time schooling and take on two separate jobs just to make ends meet. He doesn't let himself think about anything. He stares at his sneakers, the slice of pizza forgotten. "Well, hyung," he says, finally, after a moment's pause. "Your future is just beginning, you know?" He doesn't look over at Yoongi, but he can feel the tips of his ears getting hot in a way that has nothing to do with the hazy summer air. "Every day is a new start. Just keep putting one foot in front of the other and do what you can. I'll support you however you need. I promise."The little alley corner outside the plaza is quiet. A few passersby chatter as they make their way along the sidewalk. Occasionally a bike passes by them, a few cars. It's quiet. Hoseok's heart pounds against his ribs with each passing second.Yoongi's hand enters Hoseok's field of vision, his pinky finger extended. Hoseok blinks at it, lifting his head to look over at Yoongi in surprise. Yoongi's mouth quirks into a smile, and he wiggles his finger. "Promise?" he asks.Hoseok curls his pinky around Yoongi's. "Promise," he replies, laughing and looking away, suddenly shy."I'll do my best, Hoseok-ah," Yoongi says, nudging Hoseok's shoulder with his before he untangles their fingers. "Come on," he continues, getting to his feet. "It's getting late. Don't want to miss the last train.""Right," Hoseok says, thinking of the upcoming two transfers in his future. He heaves a sigh, clambering up after Yoongi. "I need to get a car," he mumbles, finishing off the last of his pizza and wiping his hands and mouth on a napkin. They continue up the street together. At the train station a few blocks over, they'll have to part ways and head in opposite directions. It's still so quiet, but it's nice. It's a good sort of silence, one Hoseok doesn't feel compelled to fill for once. It's such a novelty not having to be on all the time, just to relax and settle into his own skin for a while.When they first started hanging out just the two of them, Hoseok thought it would be weird without Seokjin there to act as a buffer. Yoongi surprised him, though. There was a weird sort of understanding between them. No expectations, no pressure — just letting each other breathe. Hoseok always misses Seokjin on the nights he can't join them, but it's still— it's good. It's different, but it's no less good.The streetlights glow overhead, neon signs bathing the world around them in shades of red and blue and orange. He can't see the stars in the middle of the city, but that doesn't stop Hoseok from trying. Yoongi slings an arm out, hand cupping the nape of Hoseok's neck, guiding him out of the way of an incoming lamp post."Thanks," Hoseok says, laughing."Yeah, yeah," Yoongi says, fingertips digging into Hoseok's nape for a moment before he lets go, hand trailing feather-light down the length of Hoseok's back. Hoseok shivers, despite the heat. "Get your head out of the clouds before you give yourself a concussion, alright?"Hoseok smiles, ducking his head and following after Yoongi. He can still feel the faintest graze of Yoongi's fingernails across his skin. He doesn't know how to say, 'Please touch me again,' without it sounding weird. He doesn't say anything at all, catching up and slipping his arm around Yoongi's shoulders on the opposite side of the lamp posts to avoid any other potential collisions.Yoongi talks about his day at work on the way up the street. They were busy, Jungkook was a little shit, their customers were actual shits, he hasn't had a proper shit in a couple days so he should probably get more fiber in his diet, right—"Hyung!" Hoseok interrupts, laughing. "Yes, more fiber. Drink some water. Eat a goddamn vegetable every once in a while, damn."Pulling a face and sighing heavily, Yoongi agrees, "If I must."They walk on in silence for another few moments, but Hoseok catches Yoongi glancing over at him out the corner of his eye. Yoongi licks his lips. Hoseok's pulse quickens. "Hoseok-ah," Yoongi sighs, and he leans in, kissing Hoseok right on the mouth. He pushes him back. Hoseok stumbles, shoulders hitting the wall behind him, pinned by Yoongi's mouth and his tongue and his hands and his hips. The wall is probably filthy and Hoseok will care about this later, definitely, but not right now. Not when all he can focus on is the firm press of Yoongi's body against his, the way his lips move, the filthy stroke of his tongue alongside Hoseok's in his mouth. Hoseok makes a weak noise, somewhere between a startled squeak and a moan, his hands curling in the back of Yoongi's shirt. Tipping his head to the side, he kisses back as good as he gets, sucking hard on the tip of Yoongi's tongue and reeling at the hoarse groan that drags from Yoongi's throat. Yoongi cups Hoseok's jaw in his palm, thumb stroking absently across Hoseok's cheekbone as he licks deeper into Hoseok's mouth. Hoseok shivers, tightening his grip in Yoongi's shirt. The kiss is sloppy and deep, too intense for a shadowy alley well after midnight, but Hoseok doesn't care."Ah," Yoongi laughs into Hoseok's mouth, more air than sound. He presses his forehead against Hoseok's. "Fuck, hold on, my left buttcheek is vibrating."Hoseok nips at Yoongi's bottom lip as he draws away to catch his breath, blinking at him as Yoongi comes back into focus in front of him. Yoongi's hand is warm, pressed against the side of Hoseok's throat. He watches Yoongi tug his phone out from his jeans pocket, as he taps the screen and lifts the device to his ear."Hey, hyung," Yoongi greets, half-turning away from Hoseok. His hand slips away, back to his side, fingertips grazing Hoseok's chest. "What's going on?"Hoseok wets his lips with a swipe of his tongue, still watching Yoongi through the haze of the summer heat. His lips tingle and he wants nothing more than to close the distance between them again, to get his mouth on Yoongi's bare skin. What the fuck even just happened, Hoseok has no idea, but he wants more of it. Now he knows what he's been missing out on, how is he supposed to focus on anything else?"Yeah," Yoongi says. "Yeah, tomorrow night. I'll ask him. See you then, hyung." He hangs up the phone, slipping it back into his pocket and glancing up at Hoseok through the fall of faded blue-blond hair across his eyes. "You still coming to Seokjin's movie night tomorrow? He wanted me to ask what snacks you wanted."Oh. Oh, fuck. Hoseok's gut immediately plummets six feet and he staggers back into the wall, his breath caught in his throat, his heart roaring in his ears. Seokjin. Seokjin. The last movie night, Hoseok fell asleep in the middle of them, waking up in Seokjin's bed with his head pillowed on Seokjin's chest, Yoongi long gone. All Hoseok had wanted to do was lean up and kiss Seokjin. He snuck out of the room, instead, careful not to wake him.He can't do this. He can't. It's going to break his heart."Ah," Hoseok manages to say when he realizes he's done nothing but stare at Yoongi in mute, dulled horror for an inappropriate number of seconds. "No," he adds, ducking his head and shouldering past Yoongi out onto the sidewalk. "I can't go, something came up. My sister needs me for a— it doesn't matter. I can't go."Yoongi doesn't respond for a few seconds, but Hoseok can hear his footsteps, his heavy boots crunching across the street grit and pavement. "That's too bad, Hoseok-ah," Yoongi says, and he sounds almost disappointed. "I'll let him know. Maybe we can reschedule it."Hoseok coughs, stuffing his hands into his pockets, his heart thundering in his ears. "No," he says, licking his lips again. God, he can still feel a ghost of Yoongi's lips pressed up against his own. "I— no, you should go, hyung. Seokjin's been excited about that stupid movie night all week. He's missed you, you know?""R-really?" Yoongi stumbles, seemingly over nothing, as he catches up to Hoseok and looks over at him in surprise. "He said that?""Yeah," Hoseok hears himself say, distant. His mouth is dry. He swallows. His throat clicks. "Yeah, you should— you should go see him, hyung. He likes spending time with you, you know." A faint smile spreads across Yoongi's face, falling back a few steps behind. Hoseok keeps going, his heart clenching with anguish in his chest. He has to get out of here. Fuck. What the fuck. How is he going to get out of this?

The drive is quiet. That's what strikes Yoongi most: How quiet everything seems in the overcast night, broken only by their breathing, a soft slosh of water in the back seat, the sound of tires running over pavement. It's late. Hoseok stopped asking where they were going after the third time he was told to wait. "It's a surprise, Hoseok-ah," Seokjin had said. "I promise it'll be worth it." He fell silent after that.That morning, Seokjin and Yoongi filled a large plastic storage tub with hot water, dissolved sea salt into it and let it cool. They set it down in the rear passenger's footwell behind the driver's seat before they left and Hoseok curled awkwardly inside it with the end of his tail hanging over the edge. There's a blanket over it that Yoongi's in charge of keeping damp, to keep Hoseok from drying out.Yoongi glances over his shoulder, reaching back to touch the blanket. It's still wet enough. Hoseok's dozing now, his head tipped at what seems an uncomfortable angle, cheek digging into the rim of the tub. Yoongi doesn't want to risk waking him from his rest, even as uneasy as this. They're still an hour from their destination. Better to let him sleep.Seokjin pulls into the parking lot of Naksan Beach a few minutes past two in the morning. Hoseok startles awake as the car stops with a loud, rattling crank of the parking break, and some of the water splashes out of the tub onto the floor. Yoongi'll have to clean that up. "We're here," Seokjin announces unnecessarily, turning off the engine and pocketing his keys."...Where is 'here'?" Hoseok asks, his voice hoarse from disuse. "Since it's the weekend and we're all off work," Seokjin says, unbuckling his seatbelt and pushing his door open, "we thought it might be cool to give you a treat." He gets out of the car, and Yoongi follows suit, circling around the back. Seokjin opens the door behind Hoseok, reaching down and carefully lifting Hoseok out of the tub. Yoongi catches Hoseok's tail, and together they carry him away from the car. The razor sharp edges of the scales dig into Yoongi's skin even through the thick sweatshirt he stole from Seokjin's closet."We thought you might like to stretch out a bit," Yoongi says. Hoseok's face is so carefully blank. "Thought it might be better for you than being cramped up in our bathtub every night.""Oh," Hoseok says a bit dully. He looks around the empty parking lot around them and shivers as a chill wind rolls off from the ocean. Yoongi meets Seokjin's eyes. "We originally thought of just taking you to a salt water pool in seoul," Yoongi begins hesitantly. This is a far cry from the reaction they'd been hoping for, when he first pitched the idea to Seokjin a few days ago. "The water's still chlorinated though, so it might make you sick." They make their way towards the beach, sneakers scuffing across the uneven and cracked asphalt. "The ocean seemed like the best option, since that's where you came from."Hoseok clings to Seokjin's forearms. His breathing has quickened somewhat, but otherwise he doesn't seem upset. Yoongi can tell there's something wrong, though, something they couldn't have known, and his heart sinks."Don't let go of me," Hoseok whispers as they approach the transition where the parking lot turns into sand, so soft it's hard to make out over the whistling of the wind. He meets Yoongi's eyes. "When you put me in, don't let me go, hyung. No matter what happens."Well, that's not ominous at all. Yoongi and Seokjin exchange another look, unsure, but Yoongi nods. "Okay, Hoseok-ah," he replies. "I promise."Together, they walk towards the water, stumbling across the uneven, pitted landscape of the sand. Hoseok's grip on Seokjin's arms tightens with every step, his knuckles stark white in what faint street light reaches them out here, so far from the road.Yoongi kicks off his shoes and he waits for Seokjin to do the same before they move into the water. It's freezing, instantly sapping all warmth from Yoongi's skin and leaving stinging needles in its wake. He gasps out but keeps moving forward. Carefully, Seokjin and Yoongi set Hoseok down in the shallows. Hoseok reaches out for them at once, grasping each of their hands in one of his. He lets out a trembling breath as the water laps at him, long lashes fluttering. Yoongi sinks down to sit beside Hoseok, and after a moment's pause, Seokjin does the same. It's so cold it steals Yoongi's breath away, his legs on fire and turning numb all at once. Hoseok lies back, still gripping their hands tight, and he sinks beneath the water. waves wash over his head.He seems... Both more at peace and more wild in the water, somehow more ethereal and more solid. His skin catches what little moonlight filters through the clouds above, casting him in shades of blue. His scales glint, the golden ones glowing a pure gold as if sunlight were streaming down upon him. The sheer fins at either side of his face, hips, and at the end of his tail drift, following the movement of the water.Hoseok never once lets go of either Seokjin's or Yoongi's hands. His fingers stay laced between theirs, so tight Yoongi starts to lose feeling in his hand within the first few minutes. Hoseok doesn't try to swim, he never moves away. He only lies there, his eyes shut against the water, gills fluttering in the tide. It's freezing. Yoongi starts to shiver uncontrollably, his teeth chattering. Neither he nor Seokjin speaks, they hardly move. Sunrise comes sooner than any of them expect. The world around them lightens from a deep, inky grey to a watery steel. Seokjin or Yoongi have never seen Hoseok turn back into a human: It's as immediate and horrible as his transformation into a merman. His nails dig into Seokjin's and Yoongi's hands, his knuckles gone white once again as his tail splits. Bloody scales slough off of him to reveal his skin beneath, forming into legs and feet, his mouth opened under the water in a silent scream as his spine arches up off the sand.He rises above the surface, gasping. The water washes the blood away though a few stubborn scales cling to his legs. His gills are already beginning to shut, leaving thin white scars along his ribs. He releases Yoongi and Seokjin, turning away from them. He turns his back on the water and crawls up towards the shore. Hoseok's hands curl in the wet sand and shells and debris, his entire body trembling as he visibly fights back tears.He loses.Huge, gulping sobs rack his suddenly fragile form, his hands twisting and clenching, as if reaching out for something. His knees sink deeper into the wet sand and he becomes even louder, an unearthly, mournful wail that raises the hairs on the back of Yoongi's neck. Yoongi startles, moving closer, only to be halted by harsh Seokjin's grip on his shoulder, nails digging in sharply through his sweatshirt.The sun breaks over the horizon as his weeping begins to subside, washing over him in a pale, golden light. His hitching breaths slow, softening. He sits there, staring at nothing, for a handful of heartbeats. Yoongi's breaking heart aches as he watches Hoseok's trembling back. "Hoseok-ah," he whispers.That breaks the spell. Hoseok's spine straightens and he climbs unsteadily to his feet. "Take me home," he says.As Yoongi and Seokjin stand and move to join him, he reaches out for their hands without looking at either of them. He clutches at them tightly, keeping the two of them close as they all make their way up the beach, towards Seokjin's car where towels and clean clothes await them. Seokjin dumps out the plastic tub across the parking lot and moves it into the trunk while Yoongi takes over the task of drying Hoseok. He rubs his hands over the towel wrapped around Hoseok's shoulders, trying desperately to work warmth back into his skin. "Will you sit with me this time?" Hoseok asks in a soft whisper, not meeting Yoongi's gaze. He doesn't move at all beyond where Yoongi directs him to dry him off.Yoongi stares for a moment. He can't help it. Hoseok looks exhausted, drained. His damp pale hair hangs limp across his forehead, eyes downcast. He seems so much smaller. The cracks in Yoongi's heart wedge that much deeper. Fuck, what have they done? "Of course," he says. "Of course I will, Hoseok-ah."Hoseok holds Yoongi's hand in his lap the entire drive back to Seoul. He stares through the window and plays absently with Yoongi's fingers, tracing them over and over again with his fingertips, as if committing him to memory. Yoongi tries not to stare, but his gaze is drawn to Hoseok's profile again and again. Seokjin drives with the heat cranked and the radio off. None of them speak.After they drop Hoseok off outside his apartment building, Yoongi climbs into the front seat. "...Did we fuck everything up?" he whispers, as Seokjin pulls away from the curb. His voice comes out in a hoarse croak and he coughs to clear his sore throat. "Hyung. What if we pushed him away?""I don't know," Seokjin replies, just as soft. He scrubs a hand over his tired face, merging into early morning traffic. "I don't know what to think anymore, Yoongi-yah."Yoongi throws himself into studying and catching up on assignments he'd put off earlier in the week as a distraction from the heartache and deep, twisting anxiety. He resurfaces only when he hears someone knocking that afternoon. Seokjin went out at some point, though Yoongi can't recall him saying where he was going or why. Ah, well. Stretching his arms up over his head with a groaning yawn, Yoongi gets to his feet and moves through the apartment to answer the door. To his surprise, Hoseok stands on the doorstep, overnight bag slipping down his arm as if nothing is amiss. "Hey," he says, hitching the bag higher up on his shoulder. "You gonna let me in?" Blinking, Yoongi moves out of the way to let Hoseok pass. The corner of Hoseok's mouth twitches slightly.

Chapter Notes
warning for a mild mentioned injuryfor the prompt: bandaid



The three of them sprawl on one of the few park benches in the shade. Hoseok perches on the back of the bench, his beat-up sneakers braced on the seat, his hands curled around the wood at his sides to keep his balance. His board is half underneath the bench in front of him, in easy reach in case he needs a quick getaway. When he'd first sat down so that Seokjin could rest, his whole body had vibrated with a restless sort of energy.Seokjin sits to Hoseok's left with a cool bottle of water pressed against the swelling bruise on the side of his face where he hit the pavement earlier. Jungkook sits to Hoseok's right, his head tipped over to rest on Hoseok's thigh. He radiates heat through the fabric of Hoseok's shorts, too hot for the summer afternoon, but Hoseok doesn't have it in him to push Jungkook away.Absent fingernails pick at the corner of one of the old bandaids Hoseok has on his shin. The edges of Jungkook's nails are rough and bitten, scraping across Hoseok's skin just enough for Hoseok to shiver despite the heat. He lets Jungkook to it, staring out over the park, listening to the distant wheels of other skaters hitting the pavement. That restlessness seems to have passed, now, trickling out of him with each sweep of Jungkook's nails over his skin.Something wet and cold presses against Hoseok's arm and Hoseok twitches, looking down to see Seokjin smiling at him, offering the water bottle. His lips glisten even in the shade, slick and shiny. The corner of Hoseok's mouth twitches. He accepts the bottle, tipping his head back to drink.(He doesn't notice the way both Seokjin and Jungkook's eyes linger on the line of his throat as he swallows. By the time he's finished, hands the bottle off to Jungkook, both of them are staring out across the park. Hoseok digs his nails into the rough wood grain.)It's been a good day, he thinks.

Chapter Notes
warnings for a little sads, but nothing really too badthis is the voice actor!hob au, which is very near and dear to my heart. it kind of spiraled into a huge thing that i'll write properly soon, but here's a cute little mid-relationship teaser.the lullaby jungkook sings hob back to sleep with is from there for you by troye sivan (bc i couldn't remember who else jungkook listens to rip)



Jungkook rolls over onto his back, staring up at the brown waterspots marring the hotel room ceiling. He's alone, for now; his roommate went out with the rest of their team, leaving Jungkook (who claimed a headache) behind. Jungkook doesn't mind.He tightens his grip around his phone. He counts the spots on the ceiling. He doesn't want to think of how much it would cost to call home....He does it anyway.The phone rings. Jungkook stares up at the ceiling. It rings and rings. He keeps his phone plastered to the side of his face. "Pick up," he whispers, his heart thudding in his throat. "Please, pick up.""'Lo?" comes Hoseok's voice, slow and deep and meandering. "Jungkookie?"Jungkook's breath catches in the back of his throat, sharp like glass. "Hyung," he manages after a moment, his eyelids fluttering shut. He can hear Hoseok breathing. "What time is it? Did I wake you?"A pause. Jungkook hears distortion over the line, a deeper inhale. "S'four in the morning," Hoseok murmurs, his lips smacking. Fuck. The sheets rustle, a gentled sigh. "Ah, my Jungkookie.""I'm sorry," Jungkook says, but he doesn't mean it. Not really. "Do you have an early call tomorrow?"Hoseok hums, sweet and soft. "No," he sighs again. "No, I don't have to go in until ten." Another pause filled with quiet breathing. "...Everything okay?" he asks, voice coming a bit more conscious now, like he's only just realizing that Jungkook's voluntarily called him. "Did something happen?"Jungkook rolls onto his side, hugging one of the pillows to his chest and hiding a sad smile into it. "No, nothing," he replies, and he sounds so small and lost to his own ears. "I just... I miss you, baby.""Jungkookie," Hoseok coos again. "It's good to hear your voice." Jungkook warms at the words, and he buries his heated cheeks in the pillow even though Hoseok can't see. "Do you want hyung to come pick you up at the airport next week? I want to take you out... Bring you home. Hug you all night. Make you play with my hair. Nobody does it right, like you do.""Yeah," Jungkook says, muffled into the pillows, smile stretching across his face. "Yeah, baby. I want that. Keep me all weekend." He knows he can't, he'll have to keep playing and stream most of the weekend, but he can dream. Hoseok yawns, a cute little whine, and Jungkook's heart skips. "Baby, you should go back to sleep. Don't let me keep you up.""No, stay on the line," Hoseok pleads softly, and Jungkook can hear his voice hitch. "Will you sing for me, Jungkookie?"Jungkook's throat tightens with how much he yearns to have Hoseok in his arms. He rolls onto his back, taking a deep breath before opening his mouth to sing, keeping his voice soft and slow. "Boy, I'm holding on to something, won't let go of you for nothing..." Hoseok exhales, his breath wavering over the line. Jungkook goes on, "There was a time that I was so blue, what do I got to do to show you?" When he sings again, Hoseok harmonizes with him, half-asleep, half-out of tune, "I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you, but you gotta be there for me too..." He listens as Hoseok's voice drifts off, his breathing deepening and slowing still further as he falls asleep. "I love you, baby," Jungkook whispers, slipping past his lips before he even registers the words. He covers his mouth with his hand as if he could somehow force it back down his throat, but what's been said can't be unsaid. It's not so bad. Of course he loves Hoseok. He always has. Jungkook closes his eyes, listening to Hoseok breathe. It calms him back down.One more week. Maybe Jungkook will be brave enough to say it to Hoseok properly then.

Chapter Notes
warnings for hob getting scared out of his MIND and jungkook comforting him
this one's for dani who requested it, and also still for amelia since she helped me out with the prompt and made it so much better than what i had planned for it, haha. thank you lovey. 
for the prompt: "horror movies"



Hoseok sprawls out on the sofa beside Jungkook, groaning as he tries to get himself more comfortable and wiggling to get the remote control out from beneath his ass. He tries different positions, but nothing seems right. Finally, he nudges against Jungkook's side, butting his head against Jungkook's shoulder until the younger man laughs, lifting his arm so Hoseok can settle against his chest. He sighs then, satisfied.
Jungkook's fingers slip through Hoseok's hair, slow and rhythmic in a way that has Hoseok's eyelids already drooping. "What are we watching?" Hoseok mumbles, as Jungkook's hand sweeps across his back to his waist, fingertips inching ever lower. Whatever Jungkook says is lost on Hoseok, thoroughly distracted by how Jungkook trails his fingers up and down the skin of Hoseok's back beneath his shirt. Hoseok sighs, nuzzling further into Jungkook's chest. 
It'd been a long day at the studio, running through his script without stopping and screaming himself hoarse until the director was finally satisfied. They were on a strict schedule and needed to get these smaller roles filled as soon as possible. He was surprised but not displeased to see Jungkook already waiting for him outside the door when he arrived home. 
The moment Jungkook heard how rough Hoseok's voice had become, he disappeared into the kitchen. Hoseok had watched him go, bemused, and left him to his devices to shower and change into something more comfortable. After, Jungkook returned to the living room, promising food delivery on its way and presenting Hoseok with a cup of steaming green tea with honey to help Hoseok's throat recover. 
Hoseok's heart leaped at the thoughtful gesture, hiding a beaming smile behind the cup. The words, 'I love you,' threatened to spill past his lips, but he swallowed it back again and again like persistent bile. It wasn't the time yet. Not yet.
It dawns on Hoseok fairly early that it's a horror film that Jungkook sat him down to watch. His gut churns at the very thought of it, and he buries his face in Jungkook's sweater to hide from the screen. He can tough it out so long as Jungkook keeps petting him, he reasons, forcing his focus onto the gentled sweeps of Jungkook's fingers across his skin rather than the slow creep of dread playing out on the screen.
He makes it about half an hour before an unexpected jump scare spooks him so badly that he climbs Jungkook like a tree, shrieking at the top of his lungs. (The tea helped his throat a lot, actually. He'll have to remember that trick for his next session.) 
Jungkook clutches at Hoseok's waist, trying to keep their balance on the couch despite the way Hoseok's panicked flailing threatens to topple them both down onto the floor. "What— what's going on?" he shouts to be heard over Hoseok's squeaks. "Hyung? Are you— are you scared? But I thought—"
"Of course i'm scared," Hoseok squeals, burying his face in Jungkook's shoulder. The music picks up, an uneasy, driving, minor melody as he hears the protagonist's breath hitch through his shitty television speakers. "I hate this! I hate scary movies!"
"But," Jungkook says, and he still sounds so confused, "Hoseokie hyung, you do horror games! Why are you so scared? This movie isn't even that scary! It's a psychological thriller!"
"I don't watch all the games I perform in, Jungkook," Hoseok yelps into Jungkook's sweater, his arms tightening around Jungkook's narrow waist. His throat feels tight. He can feel a pressure building up in his forehead, behind his clenched eyelids. Somehow one of his legs got hooked over the back of the couch, the cushions caught in the bend of his knee. "I just say the words on the script! I don't have to see what happens!"
"But—"
"Just hold me, you ass!" Hoseok wails, and sniffles.
Jungkook tightens his hold around Hoseok, gingerly lifting Hoseok's leg from the back of the couch and rearranging him in his lap. Hoseok cowers, clinging to Jungkook's shoulders with his face tucked into the side of his neck. "I'd rather hold your ass," Jungkook mumbles.
That startles a wet laugh past Hoseok's lips. "Good luck with that," he replies, flinching and clenching his hands into fists in the back of Jungkook's sweater as he hears someone scream behind him. "Might never even let you near my ass again, after this. Who the fuck just springs a horror movie on someone."
"It's a psychological thriller," Jungkook protests. "It's not even— it's a really interesting take on different horror tropes— a social commentary on how we view—" He heaves a sigh, apparently losing steam on whatever argument he'd been building towards. "Look, hyung. Do you want me to turn it off?"
Though Hoseok wants to say yes at once immediately, his pride stops the word dead in its tracks on the tip of his tongue. He leans back in Jungkook's lap just enough that he can meet the younger man's eyes. "...You sure you won't think I'm a totally lame boyfriend if I say yes?" he asks.
Jungkook throws his head back with a hearty guffaw. "Hyung, don't worry, I don't have any trouble with that—" Scoffing, Hoseok slaps Jungkook's shoulder. Jungkook laughs even harder, his whole body shaking with mirth beneath Hoseok. He turns off the television, plunging them into silence and darkness. Hoseok's heart thuds in his chest. He sniffles again.
Tipping his head back on the cushion, Jungkook looks up into Hoseok's face. "Hey," he murmurs softly, reaching out to brush his thumb across the wetness pooling beneath one of Hoseok's eyes. "You were really scared, huh?"
Hoseok drops his gaze, shifting his weight in Jungkook's lap. "Yeah," he makes himself say finally, softly. "I don't like horror movies. I get scared easily."
Jungkook's fingers brush back through Hoseok's hair, sweet and slow. "Okay. Sorry." His hand continues down the back of Hoseok's head, curling around his nape. "Come here," he murmurs, wetting his lips with a swipe of his tongue. "I'll keep you safe, baby."
Baby. Breath hitching, Hoseok lets himself be tugged gently forward. His fingers unclench from the back of Jungkook's sweater to curl around the sides of Jungkook's throat, tipping his head to the side to brush their mouths together. Jungkook brushes his fingers through Hoseok's hair again, soft, careful. Both his hands sweep down Hoseok's back, curving around Hoseok's ass through his sweatpants, and Hoseok laughs into the kiss. 
I love you, Hoseok does not let himself say. Not yet. The time's not right yet. 
But it will be soon.

Chapter Notes
nothing really to warn for. this is nothing but a new year's eve smooch (and makeouts)i haven't decided if this is how they're gonna get together in the actual full version of this fic yet (or if hoseok's main blizzard character will be from WoW/HS or OW) but this is enough for now, hehe :')happy new year!



"Want some?" Hoseok asks, holding the thermos out towards Jungkook.Smiling, Jungkook accepts it and takes a sip. The hot chocolate is gloriously hot and rich, not too sweet, the perfect defense against the chilly night air. His next sip earns him one of the miniature marshmallows and he sighs, letting it melt on his tongue for a moment before chewing. As he swallows, he reflects on how they came to be here, together. On New Year's Eve.When Hoseok's plans with other friends fell through for some reason or another, rather than letting him sit alone at home, Jungkook offered to take Hoseok out. Hoseok suggested a late picnic along the river to watch the fireworks at the turn of the year. Jungkook gladly agreed.Their friendship has been steadily growing over this past year since they met, introduced by their mutual friend, Kim Namjoon. Jungkook almost can't believe his luck even to this day, that the actor who voiced some of his favourite characters wanted to be his friend. They'd been getting closer recently, getting friendlier and... flirtier. Jungkook still doesn't know if Hoseok flirts back because he genuinely likes him, or if he's just naturally a flirtatious person. It could be both, but it's so hard to tell.Burrowing deeper into his coat and scarf, Jungkook stares out across the water. It isn't snowing unlike a few days earlier, and while that snow has melted since, it feels cold enough now for it to snow again. He can almost taste it in the air, and every breath mists in front of their faces. Jungkook's hands tremble in his lap, his guts churning with nerves.The tips of Hoseok's ears and nose are bright pink, almost glowing in the dark. He has black knit hat is tugged down over his hair, folding his ears down slightly, cutely. A matching thick black scarf is knotted about his throat. Hoseok pouts in an absent sort of way as he stares out across the dark water. He doesn't even seem to realize he's doing it. It's painfully cute. He shivers and clutches at the thermos to warm his hands.They're sitting right on the bank of the river. A biting breeze drifts across the surface of the water, nipping at any exposed skin. Jungkook shifts closer to Hoseok, winding an arm around Hoseok's narrow waist and tugging him bodily over. Hoseok tucks his chin into his scarf, laughing under his breath as he settles, pressed tight to Jungkook's side. They'll have a perfect view of the fireworks from here.Jungkook clenches his hand in his lap, between his spread thighs, out of Hoseok's line of sight. At midnight, he's going to kiss Hoseok. As a friendly gesture, played off as a traditional New Year kiss to test the waters and see how Hoseok reacts. If it's a positive reaction, if Hoseok kisses him back, Jungkook will tell him how he feels. If Hoseok just laughs it off or responds poorly, well... At least Jungkook will know once and for all where they stand, even if it'd break his heart a bit. He'd rather know, rather than continue chasing after Hoseok like a lovesick puppy.His hand curls, cupping the underside of his thigh as he presses his knees together for warmth. Hoseok's coat is soft, padded, made of a silky sort of material that makes it hard for Jungkook's gloved hand to get a good grip on it. He takes a deep breath to calm himself down. Either way, he'll have an answer at midnight. The groups of people around them chatter amongst themselves, laughter rising in pitch and excitement. It must be getting close."How much longer?" Jungkook asks. His voice shakes and he pinches the underside of his thigh. Calm down.Hoseok casts Jungkook a sidelong glance, his long lashes casting shadows across his cheeks from the nearby lamp posts lighting the path behind them. "Ten to," he replies, the screen of his watch flashing in the dark. "Are you cold?""A bit," Jungkook says. He wishes he were brave enough to suggest making out both to warm up and kill time until midnight hits. Instead, he shifts closer to Hoseok's side, resting his head on the older man's shoulder. His heart thuds against his ribs. "Are you having fun?""Of course," Hoseok says with a sweet little laugh. "Yeah, I am. Thank you for coming out with me tonight, Jungkook-ah. It means a lot to me, I think I would've been sad staying home alone.""It's no problem, hyung," Jungkook replies. "I didn't have any plans anyway." This is a blatant lie. Jungkook's been planning for a twenty-four-hour celebratory livestream on his Twitch channel for months. He'd bought decorations. He'd dug out old board games from his childhood from boxes in his parents' attic back in Busan. He'd scheduled guests. He'd bought little bottles of cheap champagne.And he'd dropped all of that when Hoseok called him. It doesn't matter. There will be so many other opportunities for marathon livestreams. He knows deep down in his heart that if he doesn't confess his feelings now, tonight, he might never pluck up the courage to do so again.To kill the remaining time, they talk a bit about Hoseok's upcoming voice-over projects and Jungkook's plans for his Twitch channel. Hoseok's always so encouraging, so supportive of his goals, no matter how far-reaching or ridiculous they sound when Jungkook says them out loud. Conversation flows between them so easily, so smoothly, just as it always has. God, Jungkook likes him so much. He fiddles with the elasticated hem of Hoseok's bomber jacket, bending it back and forth between his fingers.As midnight approaches, the voices around them grow louder and louder. Hoseok reaches out, taking Jungkook's hand in his own and laces their fingers together. Jungkook regrets opting to wear gloves for the second time that night. Even though the fabric, Jungkook can feel how chilled Hoseok's fingertips have gotten."Are your fingers numb?" Jungkook asks, laughing."A bit," Hoseok parrots, and Jungkook laughs even harder.Around them, the other people begin to chant the final countdown. Jungkook half-turns towards Hoseok on their shared blanket. Hoseok smiles back at him, open and warm. Somehow, the nerves eating him up from the inside out all night begin to... calm. Jungkook settles into it.Five... Four... Three... Two...At one, Jungkook tightens his grip on Hoseok's hand and pitches forward to press their lips together. He keeps it brief, chaste, little more than an innocent peck. "Happy new year, hyung," he starts to say, brushing his thumb across the back of Hoseok's hand,but the words get lost somewhere between them as Hoseok curls his free hand around the nape of Jungkook's neck. his fingertips press into the side of Jungkook's throat, applying the slightest pressure. Jungkook sways close and Hoseok seals their mouths back together.Jungkook's lips were already parted from trying to speak, and Hoseok licks into his mouth, a deeper kiss that makes Jungkook's breath hitch. He tightens his grip on Hoseok's hand and in the back of his coat. Fireworks pop and bang overhead, filling the air around them with light and sound. His mind goes beautifully, blissfully blank. He doesn't know what to do. He rubs his tongue against Hoseok's, hesitantly, and Hoseok makes a weak sound in the back of his throat, audible even over the fireworks. Jungkook's heartbeat roars in his ears.Hoseok pulls back, his eyes catching the lights of the fireworks. He smiles as he meets Jungkook's gaze, a bit breathless, a bit shy. Jungkook stares in awe as Hoseok turns his head to watch the fireworks. It takes him a few moments to recover enough to do the same, but even so his eyes keep getting dragged back to Hoseok's profile over and over again. He can't even help it, much preferring to watch the play of light across Hoseok's skin rather than the explosions up in the sky. Hoseok's glistening lips seem almost pinker, a grin quirking the corners of his mouth as he watches the fireworks. Jungkook can't tear his gaze away, unable to keep a matching grin off his face."Happy new year," Hoseok says, as people cheer and celebrate after the finale. He tilts his head towards Jungkook, still smiling. "D'you want to go on a date with me?" Jungkook blurts. Hoseok's still holding his hand. The smile on Hoseok's face turns a bit sly. "Want to say this was our date and come back to my place tonight?" Oh, fuck. Nodding in disbelief, Jungkook leaps to his feet. Hoseok laughs, following more sedately. He gathers up their things while Jungkook bounces impatiently on the balls of his feet. At once, he holds out his arms to carry the bag Hoseok's packed up. "Let's go," he says. "Where'd we park, anyway?"With another sweet laugh, Hoseok slips his hand into Jungkook's and tugs him towards the parking lot. "Come on, Jungkook-ah."Some fifteen minutes later, Hoseok leads the way into his apartment, setting his shoes aside in the cabinet and hanging up his coat. He steps into slippers set by the door and moves further inside. Jungkook rushes to follow suit, setting his boots on an empty shelf in the cabinet and scrambling to hang up his coat instead of just stuffing it inside and shutting the door on it. He takes one of the pairs of guest slippers and rushes deeper into the apartment.While they were in the car Jungkook's nerves came back to him with a vengeance. He trapped both hands between his thighs, staring hard out the window to keep from watching Hoseok with an undoubtedly dazed, lovestruck expression on his face. This was happening? Somehow? How was this happening? What was he supposed to do? Jungkook doesn't do stuff like this, he barely has time for a social life beyond video games and streaming, what is he supposed to do here? They arrived at Hoseok's building before he could find an answer.Now he finds Hoseok leaning against one of the cupboards in his kitchen, the thermos and other containers from their picnic dinner filled with water and sitting in the sink. Hoseok looks a bit shy as Jungkook approaches. He licks his lips. "Do you want something to drink?" he asks, fiddling with a loose bottle cap on the counter. "Or maybe something to eat, I might have something in the fridge—""No, hyung," Jungkook interrupts, his voice soft. He clears his throat, ducking his chin and looking down at the pristine tile floor. "I just want you."Hoseok sucks in a breath and Jungkook's head snaps up, eyes wide. He takes a step closer and Hoseok walks towards him, his hand outstretched. Jungkook reaches out for him, lacing their fingers together the instant they touch. "Okay," Hoseok says. "Where do you want me?"Warmth floods Jungkook's cheeks, the tips of his ears prickling with heat. "I don't—" his voice cracks and he clears his throat again, tightening his grip on Hoseok's hand. "Wherever you think would be best."Humming, Hoseok tugs Jungkook a bit closer. "Well," he says, his eyes bright, "there's something I want to show you, something I think you'd really be interested in. Come with me."Jungkook nods and stumbles after Hoseok as he leads him away from the light of the kitchen and the living room, down a dark hallway towards a closed door. Hoseok turns the knob and pushes the door open to reveal an equally dark room. Jungkook can make out the vague shape of a bed through the darkness, and he swallows, his eyes wide. Does Hoseok want to—?"Hyung..." he begins. He struggles not to get carried away with how fast his heart races. "Hm?" Hoseok murmurs, flipping on the light. A large, neatly made bed takes up most of the space, with a dark green comforter and crisp white sheets. His pillows are plush, straining against their white and green striped cases. He has dark wood furniture, bedframe, a dresser, side tables, and a matching bookcase filled with easily hundreds of books. Black framed art prints hang on the wall above his bed, a riot of bright colours.Without another word, Hoseok leads Jungkook deeper into the room, passing the bed by. Over in the corner near the bookcase are three shelves packed with figures. As they approach, Jungkook begins to recognize them: All of them are characters Hoseok has voiced over the years from video games, television, and film, including several of Jungkook's absolute favourites.Jungkook's jaw drops, his eyes widening. "Hyung! Oh my god!" He stares, stepping closer. "Oh my god! Hyung!"Hoseok laughs, bright and delighted. "I told you that you'd be interested!"Reaching out, Jungkook lifts one of the little figurines off the shelf. Hoseok's most recent character from the World of WarCraft and Hearthstone games, and the one Jungkook plays the most. It's heavier than he'd expected. "I'm stealing him," he informs Hoseok without looking away from the figure. "Just so you're aware. When you're not paying attention, I'll strike, and you'll never see it again.""Uh huh," Hoseok replies, and when Jungkook glances over at him, he's smiling at Jungkook, sweet and soft and fond. "I've got my eye on you, you know.""Good." Jungkook turns his attention back to the figure. "I like a challenge." The arms move and Jungkook amuses himself for a moment, waving the tiny sword through the air. "Do you have a favourite?" he asks, carefully setting the figure back down in its place on the shelf.Hoseok falls into a thoughtful silence for a few moments, his eyes drifting across the figurines. "You know... They're all special? They're all different, but so many share similarities in their own way. I couldn't choose... There's a small piece of me in all of them."Jungkook watches Hoseok for a moment, takes in the way his eyes seem to have grown even brighter though it might have something to do with the LED striplights Hoseok has installed along the bottoms of the shelves. "...D'you want a piece of me in you?" The flirtatious joke slips past his lips even as he thinks the words, before he can bite down on his tongue to keep them in his mouth.For the second time that night, Hoseok surprises him: Far from being offended, Hoseok starts to cackle, stumbling forward into Jungkook's side for support, clapping his hands together. His breath is hot and puffs across the side of Jungkook's neck in waves as a fit of squeaking giggles seems to overtake him completely. It's adorable.As Hoseok starts to calm, Jungkook ducks his head, cupping the side of Hoseok's face in his palm. "Offer's always open, you know." Hoseok snorts, looking up into Jungkook's eyes with a playful grin. "I might take you up on that."Jungkook presses their mouths together and backs Hoseok up towards the bare sliver of wall between the bookcase and the shelves. Hoseok's still laughing a bit, but he settles into the kiss, tipping his head and nipping at Jungkook's bottom lip. It leaves a sharp sting, and he soothes it with a swipe of his tongue. Hoseok's arms curl around the nape of Jungkook's neck, his back arching away from the wall to press against Jungkook's body with a breathy little sound. He tugs at the back of Jungkook's shirt, guiding him back, and together they stumble towards the bed to sprawl out across the mattress without stopping kissing even once. Jungkook's uncertain. He hasn't kissed that many people in his life, he hasn't had time, but he makes up for his lack of experience with enthusiasm. Hoseok makes a muffled, startled sound as Jungkook tries to shove his entire tongue into Hoseok's mouth. Carefully, slowly, he gentles the kiss. Jungkook follows his lead, learning from example what Hoseok likes, what he wants. Hoseok keeps making these sweet, soft sounds of encouragement that sends heat searing beneath Jungkook's skin at every point of contact between their bodies."Mm, we should—" Hoseok gasps an indeterminate amount of time later, between kisses as Jungkook cups his ass in his hands and squeezes. "Oh, fuck, Jungkook-ah— we should slow down."Jungkook pulls back from Hoseok's mouth with great reluctance, though he refuses to move his hands from Hoseok's ass. "Okay, hyung," he sighs. He knows Hoseok's right, but god, he wants so much. His lips hurt from so long spent making out."It'll be worth the wait," Hoseok whispers, kissing Jungkook again, rolling his tongue slow and sensual into Jungkook's mouth. Jungkook groans, his hands tightening around Hoseok's ass, and Hoseok's breath hitches. "Fuck, I promise. You're gonna be so good for me, aren't you?""I will," Jungkook answers, stroking his thumbs across the top of Hoseok's ass and licking his lips as Hoseok shudders, pressing his hips back into Jungkook's palms. "I'm gonna be the best."Hoseok grins. "You already are."They spend the rest of the night talking, laughing and trading sweet kisses, until the light of the sun begins to filter through the blinds covering the window.

Digging the knuckles of his fore and middle fingers into the ball of Hoseok's foot, Yoongi grins at the sudden eruption of curses hissed out between Hoseok's clenched teeth. He tightens his grip around the top of Hoseok's foot and presses in even harder before releasing and running his thumb along the arch of Hoseok's foot. "Better?" he asks."Ah, f—fuck you," comes Hoseok's response, the drawn-out groan muffled from behind a cushion he appears to be attempting to smother himself with. Yoongi presses in a little deeper and Hoseok's foot jumps in Yoongi's hands with a yelp, "Fuck you!"Yoongi's grin broadens. "That good, huh?"Hoseok pushes the pillow down just enough to glare at Yoongi over the edge of it, his eyes shining with pained tears. "When I asked you to help, this wasn't what I had in mind, hyung. This is torture, cruel and unusual punishment.""Aw, don't be a baby," Yoongi says, digging both thumbs into the base of Hoseok's heel and sweeping up over the arch. Hoseok's muscles are still tense in Yoongi's hands, but he's nowhere near the sorry state Yoongi had found him in. "This isn't even half as hard as Jiminnie goes on you, or even as hard you go on yourself.""It's different when it's from you," Hoseok whines, letting out a trembling breath as Yoongi cups the bottom of his foot in one hand and guides his foot through a rotation with the other. "Ah," his voice hitches. "Ah, hyung—" The joints crackle and pop, and he breathes out a sigh as Yoongi lets his hand slide down the top of Hoseok's foot. "Better?" Yoongi asks again, after another moment as he checks both of Hoseok's feet. "Doesn't feel as fucked up as when you shoved your feet in my face ten minutes ago, at least."Hoseok flexes both feet, his joints crackling and popping even more. He heaves another sigh, rolling his ankles around in slow circles. "Yeah," he admits, after a moment, drawing his feet out of Yoongi's lap. "Thank you, hyung," he says, sounding somewhat reluctant.Yoongi laughs, getting up from the couch to go wash his hands. When he gets back, Hoseok has the television on, playing some movie Yoongi's unfamiliar with. He's lying on the opposite end of the couch, curled up on his side. Yoongi stops in front of him, his hands propped on his hips. "You're in my spot," he says, and Hoseok lifts his head, half-sitting up. Yoongi turns to sit in the vacated space. Hoseok drops back down with his head pillowed on Yoongi's thigh the instant he's settled. What a brat, Yoongi thinks, shaking his head. Hoseok opens his mouth and Yoongi rolls his eyes, letting his hand drop to the top of Hoseok's head. He doesn't even need to ask. Hoseok lets out a pleased sound, his eyelids drooping already. "What are we watching, anyway?" Yoongi asks."Dunno," Hoseok mumbles, tipping his head into Yoongi's hand as Yoongi starts to brush his fingers through his hair. "Just stopped on this channel because I thought that one actor was pretty."Yoongi squints at the screen, tucking stray strands of hair behind Hoseok's ear. "Which one?" he asks, as a tall, dark-haired man walks into the shot. "That one?" At Hoseok's nod, Yoongi tips his head to the side, examining the man in greater detail. He is undoubtedly handsome, bright eyes and a kind, easy smile. Dark hair spills across his forehead, styled loose and tousled as if someone just brushed their fingers through it. Even beneath the suit jacket he wears, Yoongi can make out distinct muscle definition in his biceps and across his broad shoulders.  The opposite of Yoongi, basically. "Hot, gorgeous, beautiful?" Yoongi asks. "What'd you call him? Pretty?" Hoseok snorts a laugh. "Pretty."Petty jealousy slithers around in Yoongi's gut, crawling its way up his throat. He swallows it back like persistent bile, pursing his lips as he busies himself with Hoseok's hair. It's not worth it to say anything. "Is that your type, then?"The words slip past Yoongi's lips without his permission and he freezes up, covering his face with his free hand. As he scrubs the heel of his palm across his eyes, he tries to play it cool, smothering a fake yawn. Hoseok shifts, butting his head against Yoongi's hand with a grumbled complaint. Yoongi drags his fingers through Hoseok's hair once more, combing the strands back from his forehead."Hm, maybe," Hoseok answers, thoughtfully, after a pause. "I don't know. He's attractive, sure, but so unattainable. I wouldn't know what to do with all of that, he's so pretty he doesn't even look real. No, I don't think I have a type, hyung." Hoseok huffs a tired laugh, nuzzling his cheek against Yoongi's thigh. Yoongi's heart trips over itself in his chest. "Or— I guess I never really ever thought about it like that, you know?" he says, frowning. "Maybe someone who'll take care of me, but be a bit aggressive sometimes, too." He sighs, his eyelids fluttering shut. "I don't care about height, but someone taller than me might be fun. Strong, nice shoulders... I don't know what I want, hyung." He laughs again, his hand coming up to rest beneath his cheek. The tips of his fingers dig into Yoongi's thigh. "Maybe I just need someone to be the big spoon sometimes."Yoongi prefers to be the little spoon, but for Hoseok... Well, for Hoseok, Yoongi might be willing to make some sacrifices. Maybe."What about you?" Hoseok asks softly, blinking his eyes open to peer up at Yoongi with a grin tugging at the corner of his mouth. "What's your type, hyung? Hot, gorgeous, beautiful?"You, Yoongi wants to say, but he bites down on his tongue. He shakes his head, shrugging. "To be fair, I don't think I've ever really thought about it either," he answers, smiling as he meets Hoseok's eyes. "Pretty sure my type is anyone who'd be willing to suck me off, at this point."Hoseok's eyes widen. He inhales sharply, breath catching in his throat before he rolls off Yoongi's lap and off the couch, coughing and laughing at the same time. "You can't just say that," he rasps, smacking Yoongi's knee over and over again with each hacking cough as he struggles to breathe. "Oh my god.""What?" Yoongi asks innocently, jerking his leg out of Hoseok's reach, the corners of his mouth twitching as he fights back a smile. "It's true!" "You're the worst," Hoseok says, pushing himself up off the floor with a grunt. Yoongi looks up as he hears the rattling scrape of a key sliding into their apartment door. The deadbolt flips over, hinges creaking as the door opens. Jungkook shuffles into view. He dumps his bag on the floor and starts stripping out of his coat and scarf, dragging off the knitted hat he'd stolen from Yoongi. The sweater he's wearing looks familiar too..."Hey, did you steal my sweater?"Jungkook looks up and grins as he sees Hoseok and Yoongi. "All of mine were in the laundry and I was cold this morning," he says, stepping into the living room. "You don't mind, do you, hyung?"Hoseok throws his head back on the couch beside Yoongi's knee, groaning. "You can't just take my stuff without asking," he says, a familiar complaint by now, after three months of Jungkook living with them and sleeping on their couch. The corner of Yoongi's mouth twitches again. "Promise you won't do it again.""I promise, hyung," Jungkook says, the familiar response. Yoongi doesn't even try to bite back the smile that stretches across his face. Jungkook snickers and Hoseok groans again, ever prone to dramatics, as always. "You know it's just because I like the way your clothes smell," Jungkook adds. Hoseok's head lifts off the couch and he scowls over at Jungkook, who just grins at him, bright-eyed and unrepentant. "I won't do it again," Jungkook says. "Not for the rest of the week, for sure." Hoseok throws his hands up in the air and Yoongi jerks back, narrowly avoiding getting smacked in the nose. "Fine!" Hoseok says, pushing himself up off the floor. "Don't stretch it out. You're both the worst and I'm going to bed."
