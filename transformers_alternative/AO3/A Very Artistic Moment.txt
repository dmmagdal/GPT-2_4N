My eyes were closed while I entered the loft, because it seemed that I was standing in a hen house. The guests were already squealing, intoxicated by alcohol.  Max knew how to organize memorable parties. The whole of New York fought to be invited because of the good music, delicious and original appetizers and marvellous French champagne. Every waiter was impeccably suited, in tuxedos and bow ties that seemed to have been selected in a menswear catalogue. Max was a lover of beautiful arty things as well as elegant men. As usual, he managed to convince me again to take part in one of those crazy nights surrounded by artists, art dealers, critics, collectors and the NY jet set. He knew I always hated that kind of fancy parties, but I was unable to refuse him anything. He had been my agent for several years, and he was the absolute best seller of my work. He never missed to compliment me and considered me his protégée.Max welcomed me with his eternal charming smile and took me warmly in his arms.“Honey, you look fabulous. This dress fits you perfectly. I’m flattered that you made the effort for me.”I replied with a wry grin, a little embarrassed, pretending to be jaded. Although I didn’t have a great desire to be here, I had indeed bought a beautiful gown in a vintage shop. It had cost me a fortune and tonight was a great opportunity to wear it. It was a long black silk dress that wonderfully flattered my figure. Although it was very sexy, it wasn’t vulgar and moulded to my body with class and elegance. The draped skirt was slit high, but only showed my legs when I walked. The smoothly draped top was finished with two thin straps on the shoulders extending to a large bare back. I felt like a very sexy actress from the 1930s.“My dear, don’t start with this look.  I know you hate to be here. But important collectors are here tonight. So please behave because they just might buy one or two pieces of your work.”“I’ll be as good as gold!” I froze him with a nod while rushing to grab a glass of champagne that a waiter handed me on a silver plate.“Yeah…” he answered, not at all convinced. “Tonight, I’ll introduce you to my new protégé: a painter. You’ll love him. Your approaches to art are very similar. He comes from England. You really should create something together for the next biennial. That would be just un-believ-able!” he explained with enthusiasm.“Max, not again! You know perfectly well that I prefer to work alone. And besides, he is a painter! And I am a sculptor!”“Don’t be such a spoil-sport” Max reproached me, lifting the bottom of my glass with his fingers to encourage me to drink. “Just try to relax and please don’t bite anyone.”I stared at him with a smirk and kept talking, sighing, “What is the new wonder called?”“Tom H.! He is not here yet, so go and have a little fun!”Suddenly, he pushed me unceremoniously into the arena that was his living room and rushed toward the next incoming visitors.Another waiter passed me by. I waved him to stop, put my empty glass on the tray and exchanged it for a full one. Agatha, a gallery owner in Soho, recognized me and decided to introduce me to her new boyfriend, a Wall Street millionaire. Soon, it seemed that I would have to spend the rest of the evening trying to listen to boring people with uninteresting conversations.  Maybe I was an artist, but I couldn’t get used to these surroundings. For me, these people had exclusive and juvenile, arrested opinions on art. They never created anything so they were absolutely clueless. The other artists seemed to be nothing but self-centred.  The idea of meeting one of them drove me to grab for another glass. Sometimes, I’d nod to a commentary accompanied by a false smile. In reality my gaze was attracted by the beautiful paintings and sculptures that were exhibited in my agent’s loft. Art was the only reason that brought me here tonight.In front of one of the windows, which allowed a perfect view on New York, one of my sculptures was displayed prominently on a concrete block. Nobody could avoid it. It was definitely the masterpiece of Max’s collection. A self-portrait, my naked body which I’d sculpted in white clay, and then broke and assembled again, as if in a desperate attempt to repair it. No one would see that this broken body was mine, but the sensuality of the piece was obvious. Standing alone in front of it, a man was absorbed by the milky whiteness of the clay. His stare was still and his thin hands seemed to sweep the surface of the sculpture. The light that illuminated the work highlighted his tall figure and his wavy blond hair. Cautiously I walked toward him, allowing him his reverie.“Do you like it?” I questioned.“Oh yes…” he said thoughtfully.All of a sudden, his face lit up and he turned his eyes to me. He replied with an English accent and a huge smile.“Sorry, I did not see you… Yes, I find it beautiful. This seems to be so fragile and soft. This is a broken beauty … because of time, or pain… It is just magical.”I looked at him complimenting my work, not knowing if he had any idea that I was the artist. His deep blue eyes sparkled with pleasure. His smile was huge and sincere. It seemed that I was myself facing a work of art. He was perfect, with athletic shoulders and beautifully trim waist elegantly clothed in a navy blue suit. A perfectly trimmed beard emphasized his cheekbones. His blond curls gave him a teasing look. I stared at him speechless. I heard someone saying my name in the back of the room. I turned my head to see where it came from. It was Max, praising my talent to a stranger. When I turned back I found an abandoned sculpture. He had vanished.Again I was caught up in the whirlwind of endless discussions, moving from one group to another. My eyes scanned around the room. I’d say I was looking for new works that Max had bought recently, but I was lying to myself. Actually I was looking for him. From time to time I’d see him with another group, lost in other conversations. He did not seem more passionate than me. Each time I found him, he was staring at me. When our eyes met, he pretended not to have seen me and turned his head. Both art critics with whom I conversed now were talking about the last exhibition of one of my fellow colleagues. Their mouths were loaded guns and they were shooting badly. Honestly, I did not like the exhibit either, but its intellectual approach was fascinating and interesting. When I was about to give them my thoughts I noticed Max glancing at me. He must have had a sixth sense about me, that I might throw a scathing retort that would get me into trouble. So, I politely excused myself and went to isolate myself in the library. I found another glass of champagne before going into the deserted room. I closed the door, finding myself alone, at last. I loved this library. The walls were lined with books on each side. An old mahogany desk stood in the middle of the room and a lounge chair sat near the window. On the edge of the desk a small sculpture by Brancusi was in its usual place, and had been there for ages. I was always amazed to discover it again. Its surface was so smooth, so pure. I loved to caress it with the tip of my fingers. Its contact calmed me and made me forget the crowd.With a gentle sound, I heard the door open and close. Someone had joined me in the room. I turned and saw him walking slowly towards me, gazing at me with his blue eyes. I went to open my mouth to say something, but I didn’t have time. He was now close enough to put his finger on my lips while blowing a “shush”. Without saying a word, he grabbed my champagne glass and placed it on a table beside me. He took my hand in his and lay them down on the Brancusi. His fingers, intertwined with mine, began to caress the sculpture. His gaze was set into mine. I found it hard to breathe and my head was spinning. I didn’t know if it was due to alcohol or to his sensual touch. I felt his breath on my cheek and his lips brushed the tip of my nose, then met mine in a gentle caress. He placed his hands on my hips and I felt his fingers through the silk of my dress. With more urgency, his tongue made its way between my lips and I returned his kiss. I was completely stunned, and afraid that someone would enter the room and surprise us, but yet I couldn’t bring myself to stop him. His hands glided slowly to my naked back gently stroked my skin. This touch woke up every single inch of my body. I felt my cells vibrating, my belly was about to burst into flames, and I felt my core become liquid. He pulled me against him. I could feel against my thigh his already hard erection covered by the fabric of his pants. We wanted the same thing. Unflinching, I clung to his neck, sliding my fingers through his blond curls.Suddenly he took his lips off mine and closed his arms around my waist to lift me from the ground. He carried me to a bookshelf and blocked me up against it leaning his body against mine. A new hungry kiss closed on my lips, and I couldn’t restrain a groan. His tongue had gone mad, and his hands moved from my neck down to my shoulders. I had to touch him. I needed him. My hands were walking along his back, then his waist and belly and finally towards the waistband of his pants. His muscles thrilled one by one under my touch. He sighed with pleasure knowing exactly what I was about to do. I hurriedly loosened his belt, wanting to slip my fingers under his shirt to touch his skin. Unexpectedly he bent down when my straps slipped off my arms together with the silk of my top. He brought his lips to my bare breasts; flicking my nipples hungrily with his tongue, his fingers brushing my skin. I let out a long sigh closing my eyes and swinging my head back. I felt completely crazy, uncontrollable. The old leather and paper smell of the books mingled with his fresh scent, an oriental and spicy fragrance. His kisses scrolled slowly down to my belly and inside my thighs. His beard tickled me pleasantly. My slit dress allowed his fingers to easily grab the edge my laced panties. He rolled them down along my legs, along with the palm of his hand. With one hand I held firmly to the edge of the bookshelf, the other tangled in his hair. He gently positioned one of my legs on his shoulder. He grabbed my hips with his hands to hold me against the shelf. His tongue and lips were now eagerly searching for their way. It did not take him long to find my clitoris, which he greedily licked. My whole body was trembling already. He was going to make me come just with this simple touch, I knew it. My breathing grew faster and I was losing balance, my legs becoming loose. He got up before I could unleash myself. His face dove in onto my belly and between my breasts which he held firmly in his hands. He pressed his full weight against me, holding me standing against the cabinet. My leg encircled his waist, forcing him to come closer. My fingers rushed to grab his cock and to compel him to penetrate me at last. But he stopped me, sliding his hand into mine to hold himself still against me.  His cock did not need my guidance. It slipped between my legs, brushing against my clit and following the hot and wet path that was already waiting for him. The tip of his member gently entered my folds. I could hear myself moaning with pleasure. I had just let a stranger enter my intimately, and now I was welcoming him, unable to hold a coherent though. He kissed me to silence me. He also seemed to be surprised by our actions, and that made this moment even more exciting. I felt his entire length plunging inside me, entering deeper with each thrust. My body welcomed this as I slowly fell apart. He withdrew just as slowly and almost entirely, to sink once more faster and harder. He moaned, urgently now, getting out of control. His deep voice was bewitching. He brushed my skin with the tip of his fingers tickling my breasts and my belly to move down to my cunt. Gently he pinched and caressed my clit while his cock probed me intensely. That was enough for me to feel every cell of my body explode. A wave of intense pleasure and wonder spread through my limbs without warning. All my muscles shook intensely, and my skin felt as if it was on fire. His gaze was fixed on me, staring at me. He watched as my orgasm spread through me, with the same look as he had admired my sculpture. To keep me from screaming, he placed his hand against my mouth and I greedily sucked his fingers tasting my liquid. My inner muscles vibrated frantically clenching on his cock, taking him deeper into me. And then he found his own release, restraining his cry by burying his head in my shoulder, pinning his mouth against my collarbone, licking and biting. His left hand was grinding me against the furniture, while the other tightened almost painfully on one of my breasts. I let him pour into me, feeling his body tense and then relax.After a few seconds, he lifted his face to mine, still in me, motionless. His irises had taken a dark blue and his eyes shone, riveted to mine. His expression was soft and he smiled tenderly. Slowly and gently, our bodies separated, and he bent down to my feet to pick up my black-laced panty. He gently lifted my ankles one by one to put my underwear back. While placing it back to its proper place, he brushed my lips with his and placed a series of small kisses from my jaw down below the lobe of my ear before releasing me. No word had been uttered. While he dressed himself, his face turned toward the shelf, I left the room. I was completely stunned, as if in another world.  I stood frozen in front of the exhibition entrance, watching the guests absently. I felt out of place. He passed me by without looking at me to return among the guests. Max saw and stopped him to introduce him to her neighbour.“Agatha, let me introduce you to my new protégé, Tom H.”When I heard my agent pronouncing the name of my lover, I was seized with panic. I wanted to flee. I wouldn’t be able to face him again. I couldn’t confront this painter with whom Max wanted me to work. I needed some fresh air and a place to stay with these new sensations. I felt Tom’s eyes land on me while I left the room, digging into my handbag and running out of the loft. In the mirror of the elevator I noticed the mark of his teeth had remained engraved on my shoulder…

My body lay heavy still deep in sleep, my eyes closed and my mind in a sweet coma. I wasn’t yet aware of the world around me, not even of the soft white fresh sheets and the feeling of a warm and gentle body against mine, holding me closely in two solid and tender arms. My last night’s lover lay behind me firmly holding my waist, as if frightened that I would escape him. His hands slowly caressed my belly in small circles. My senses were hazy, but the feeling of this contact became more and more vivid. I couldn’t yet see that the sun was already up or hear the noise of the street, but I was now fully aware of the sensation that his fingers were making me feel.While these cuddles slowly became more intense, I began to notice a breath against the back of my neck, urgent and heavy. A right foot slid between my ankles, gently stroking my legs. A hand cupped one of my breasts, caressing it with a thumb. I felt my nipple harden, getting tense; a wave of sweet pain ran through me. I moaned, my first sound of the day.“Good morning, Heaven!” said a low and deep voice to my ear.“Morning… ” I whispered sleepily.The man’s hands didn’t stop moving. He cradled me closer against him, his mouth kissing the base of my neck. Gentle bites, gentle kisses, and gentle licks, one after another, launching unimaginable sparks under my skin. I felt his silky skin at my back and his cock, hard, pressing against my cheeks. His caresses were tender, deeply sweet and endless. One of his hands fondled my inner thighs and folds, his fingers rubbing my lips and my clit. I felt hot and liquid. I moaned, begging for him.I didn’t want to move or to open my eyes. I was afraid this would stop, that I would not be able to keep on feeling this. I was caught between worlds, tight in his arms, attached to his skin, only able to feel my blood boiling and a big emptiness growing in my core -- an emptiness that ached and needed to be filled. I arched my back against him, pressing against his cock, reaching for his butt with my right hand to draw him toward me. He could feel that I wanted him. He heard my pleading groans. He sensed my body tensing, my skin shivering under his fingertips, my core becoming wet, my neck imprinted with each of mark of his kisses. But he took his time, enjoying every second, every movement my body surrendered to him.He pushed into me slowly, completely, with all his length, that it felt almost painful. I needed him so badly. His movements were soft, so gentle, so tender and so exquisite. The only things that existed at that moment were his body, his hands, his mouth, his cock and this passionate and endless pleasure. He made it last. I felt him tense and grow agitated, holding back. He wanted it to last until he couldn’t delay his climax anymore.“Anna-Lisa, oh, you’re so amazing! Come with me…” he whispered, moaning low.That was the first time ever I heard him say my name. I realised that I was here, with this man, and this moment was real. Everything I felt was so true, so sincere. I was awake. My body was alive. I was alive. The infinite pleasure that spread over me at that moment was tremendous. My body shook and my heart was on the verge of overflowing. My walls clenched against his cock while he trembled in me, pouring into me. We both screamed.He stayed in me, lying against me without a move. His arms were still curled around my belly. He caved his face in my neck kissing me while tears started to run from my eyes. The emotion was so intense, almost unbearable, but I never felt so much in the moment. I’d never had the sense of my own body on earth more than in that precise instant, in the arms of this man.“Good morning, Anna-Lisa. It’s time to wake up, Heaven.”I swept my tears with my hands, a bit ashamed, before turning my head to him.“Good morning, Gorgeous!” I answered with a smile.He smiled widely at the new name I’d found for him. And this name couldn’t have been truer than now. His gaze was deep blue and his whole face was so happy that my heart almost stopped beating. The sun lit up his eyes.The city was already saturated by the summer warmth. The smell of the heated asphalt pervaded my studio. He kissed my lips and I allowed him to dive into my mouth. I returned his kiss as hard as I could, grabbing his hair, pushing him back on the bed, until I could rest my head on his chest. He lay back with his arm around my shoulder. The aftermath... I never was fond of the aftermath. But today I didn’t want this man to go away.I brushed my fingertips against his chest writing words in a language that I didn’t know.“I am sorry!” he said.“Sorry for what?” I questioned him, looking for an answer in his eyes.“I don’t know. I guess I am not really sorry… I don’t know,” he answered puzzled. “I am usually not this kind of man. I usually don’t do this! I mean having sex with a wonderful woman without talking to her, asking her for a date or even… I don’t know… I used to believe I was a man with better manners. My mother taught me to respect women and earn theirs in return.” He sighed.“I understand. I am not that kind either. I am not an easy girl.”“Aren’t you scared? Because I think I am. I still don’t know how this happened. I mean I’m not ashamed and I don’t regret anything either. God, you’re so amazing! But what I felt, this urgency, this need to touch you, to hold you, to own you was so extreme that I lost control of myself. I’m afraid that I hurt you, that my desire wounded you. I couldn’t help it, and I don’t think I ever could… I’m sorry!”“No, don’t worry. I’m not scared! This was perfect” I answered, depositing a little peck on his chest to reassure him before resting my head again. I had lied. I was totally frightened about what we’d done. But I needed for one of us to feel strong and safe. So I hugged him closely.We stayed in silence a little while, until he worried again, “Are you scared of me?”“No, maybe I am a bit scared of me -- of what I might be able to do.” I finally confessed.“Oh Anna-Lisa, what is this? What are we doing? What are we feeling? I never thought such a thing would be possible. I never thought that my body could crave someone this way. Since the party, I can’t concentrate on my painting. I can’t think of anything but you!”I stared at him quietly, admiring him, reading his confusion and trying to hide my own discomfort.“What are you thinking about? Why are you so quiet? Come on, speak to me.”“How can you talk so much?” I teased him, in an attempt to change subject.He laughed. “You’re not the first person to say that. I do talk too much. I’m a loquacious man, despite your first impression.”“Well I’m not that way. It’s hard for me to express myself with words. That’s probably why I am a sculptor. I create, I don’t speak! But I love the fact that you do. Your voice makes me horny.”He grinned wickedly. “Steady girl, I’m not an easy guy!” he laughed. “What do you take me for? We need to know each other a bit better first.”“Okay, gorgeous Englishman, let’s start now. Why New York? Why did you leave England and the countryside?” I asked, resting my chin on his chest, simply wanting a chit-chat. I. I tried to decipher him with my eyes while my fingers stroked his cheekbones.“I left London, actually. I received an offer from the Columbia School of Arts that was hard to refuse. My career as a painter didn't go the way I had planned while over there. I have a master’s degree in History of Art from Cambridge. Columbia -- this was an opportunity to change direction and do something else. I didn’t think that Mrs Dresher, Columbia’s art department head, would introduce me to an art dealer – Max – that fast.”“Yes, Mrs Dresher is Max’s sister. Don’t lose hope with your career. Max is the best agent in the world. I want to know more about your paintings, tell me.”“Well it’s complicated to explain. Maybe we should have a date.”“What? You need to have a proper date to talk about your painting? You probably gave me like seven orgasms in three days and you can’t speak about your art without a date?” I joked.“First we need to eventually get out of this bed and have a nice meal in a good restaurant. Delicious and comforting food might make you talk about yourself, too. After that, you can come to my loft and see my paintings. If I have my way, I might increase our score to more than seven…” he declared with a cunning wink.“That sounds great! But if you don’t want to talk about paintings and art now, tell me something else. How is London?” I asked still in need to focus on something harmless.“London is my home, it's where I was born, and it’s where my friends and my family are. I used to live near South Bank.”“What was it like?” I encouraged him, stroking my palm tenderly on his chest and his belly.“Well, to me, the view east from the middle of the bridge is the most beautiful cityscape in the world. I must’ve run up and down along the South Bank over a thousand times…”His melodious voice mesmerized me; I couldn't hide what it did to me. My hand crept down his chest, descending along the dip in his centre. I couldn't control myself. He talked on unaware of what his voice did to me and with no clue to my reaction. I paused, waited, gauging his response. When he made no move to stop me, I brushed my fingertips gently over his length, barely caressing the soft tender skin. He whistled and moaned in a trembling breath.“And?” I whispered while my fingers gained a bit of confidence and dragged around the tip of his cock, following each vein softly down his length. He tried to keep on talking but he was on the verge of succumbing to my touch.“At 4 a.m. in the winter … there was ice floating in the Thames and snow on Big Ben. I had the South Bank all to myself…” His breath and speech halted in his arousal.He hardened under my fingertips and I watched his cock grow stiff under every slow movement. I had never been fascinated by a man’s shaft before, but for me his seemed to be the most beautiful and glorious cock ever. As unexpected as my boldness was, I couldn’t help but to close the palm of my hand around it and rub it gently, making his thin and soft skin roll under my touch. He lost track of his words and then his mind. His arms firmly tightened around my shoulders, his hands wound in my hair.He groaned desperately, pleaded for more, begged for his release. I was pleasing him; my head rested on his shoulder, listening to his heartbeat grow rapid. I couldn’t have stopped, even if I

The plaster on my hands began to crack and dry. I was covered with it up to my elbows and probably on my forehead, too. Several times I had to pull away a lock of my hair which was continuously falling in front of my eyes. Yet, I didn’t have the time for a break, because my new sculpture was beginning to look like something, at last. Concentrating deeply, I applied plaster strips on a tight iron fence. For hours, I hadn’t paid any attention to the police alarms and klaxons echoing in the streets in front of my studio. The sound of New York City reached my ears clearly through the open windows. It felt like a lullaby to me. On my father’s old record player, a recording of “Coney Island Baby” reset automatically at regular intervals. Lou Reed’s scratchy voice highlighted the drizzle, which was now refreshing this summer day in Soho. I was creating, in my universe. I heard the entrance elevator and its annoying ringing bell as it moved up. Someone was at the door; although I was not expecting anyone. Right now I did not want to be disturbed. I stopped all my activities to avoid making any noise, but in vain as the music could be heard from outside, a definite sign that I was there. A second, longer bell rang again.“My dear, it’s Max! Don’t play anti-social, please! Open the damned door! ”It was my agent. And by the way, it was not such bad timing after all. He might at least help me to move my sculpture. The structure would be several meters high and I thought it would be easier to put it down on the floor. But with all these layers of plaster, it was too heavy to lift on my own.“Just a sec Max, I’m coming!” I yelled from the other end of the apartment.I wiped my hands on my old gray T-shirt and my black linen pants. With these white marks I looked a little like the Mime, Marcel Marceau, but I knew that Max had seen me this way before.I raised the double doors of the lift ready to welcome Max. I expected to see his shiny bald head, but I was surprised to come across beautiful blond curls soaked by rain. The man who stood before me took off his sunglasses to reveal bright blue eyes glistening along with a wide smile. His gaze paralyzed me on my spot. Fuck! It was him! The painter!"Hi, sweetheart,” said Max, suddenly appearing in my visual field.He grabbed me by the shoulders to draw me in his arms and hug me warmly as usual. I stood frozen like an ice cube. He did not take any offense because I never was particularly demonstrative. He pushed me away with a wince realizing that I was covered with white plaster.  “I thought I could come along with a guest,” he said, now rubbing his stained black shirt. "I already told you about Tom last night, but you disappeared before meeting him.”Tom stared at me with a knowing glance while biting on the stem of his glasses. I swallowed painfully, embarrassed. He offered me a big hand, with his best winning smile.“Indeed, we did not had the opportunity to speak last time…”I grabbed his hand and let it go immediately. The touch of it was enough to make me feel his fingers all over my skin again. In a split second I thought I saw him wink. Bastard! Unfortunately, he was even more beautiful than I remembered. His white t-shirt and casual black jeans fit him as well as a suit. His blond locks were slightly darkened and shone from the effect of the rain. It also made his shirt slightly see-through. He seemed like a life-model from one of my academic drawing classes, and I did not need that right now. I did not want him here. But Max was standing right next to him and I didn’t want to raise any suspicion.With clenched lips, I waved them into my studio. Tom froze in the middle of the room. The place was not as spectacular and neat as Max’s loft. There were pieces of sculptures all over the floor and shelves, bulk scattered essays, from every imaginable material and sizes. The only furniture in the room was a large table in the middle, and a mattress against the wall. He stared puzzled at my bed. Curiously, Max was already running around the table where my new creation in progress rested.“This one is a very large piece. What did you put in the centre? ” he asked pointing to the metal mesh.“I built a heart with a wire fence to make the structure lighter. I am covering it with plaster strips. I will end up with layers of white clay, and hope it will stick,” I explained. "By the way, gentlemen, I could really use your help to put it on the floor. It’s becoming too heavy and too large for this table. ”“Sorry sweetie,” Max replied with a disgusted look. “I just got a stain on my shirt, and I have no desire to get a second. Don’t count on me! Tom?”The painter turned his eyes and fixed them in mine. Then he pronounced with his perfect English accent "Of course, with pleasure!”He grabbed the metal of the huge structure from one side of the table, while I was doing the same from the other. We slowly lifted the mountain of and moved it carefully. He was taller than me so I had to make an effort to keep the sculpture at level. I obviously made too much effort, because it swung toward him. He braced it with his shoulder before placing it on the floor. I rushed to my work, hoping it hadn’t been damaged. I walked around it many times, scanning every detail.“There we go! Just what I expected,” said Max in congratulations. “Tom is covered with plaster now!”Tom laughed melodiously and his face lit up with childlike sweetness. “No problem, Max, I’m used to having to do that with my paintings!”I watched as he rubbed his hands on the stained fabric of his shirt. If he took off his shirt because of that, I’d kill him. A ringing phone interrupted my reverie and prompted me to find a towel to help clean the stain. I threw it to Tom and he caught it in flight. Max now answered his mobile without paying attention to us. When he finished he declared,“I forgot an important appointment. I have to go. I’ll let you two get acquainted.”“Max, what? Is that all?” I said a panicked. He wouldn’t dare leave me now!“Yeah, sorry, I’ll call you tonight darling, Bye.” he shouted, already walking towards the exit.My stomach sank and my breathing stopped. I didn’t imagine I’d be left alone with this man. I didn’t know what to do, what to say, or what he was capable of. I didn’t know if I could handle myself. He frightened me. Yet I stood there motionless before him, as I heard the elevator depart, taking Max with it. Tom scrutinized me with a frown. I was now alone, alone with him. With his soft voice, he said  "I’m sorry about the other night …“Hearing these words, my nails dug into the palms of my hands. How dare he? How could he? Because of him I had lived the most crazy and intense experience of my life. For days the memory of his skin, his hands and his lips would not leave my mind. Now I felt rejected. I wanted to slap him.”… In any case, I have no regrets,“ he continued teasingly, closing the gap between us.He held my neck and put his fingers through my hair to pull my face to his. His lips closed over mine, forcefully. I couldn’t resist. It was even better than I remembered. I hadn’t forgotten the taste of his mouth… it obsessed me. Now I realized that I had dreamed about that. I needed his mouth, as an addict would need his drug. My tongue melted with his. I wanted to devour him. I forcefully clung to his shoulders, clinging to him. I felt his lips widen. He smiled contentedly. Then, he pulled away from me"Nice to meet you Miss, my name is Tom,” he joked.“Yes thank you, I understand that,” I answered, amused.His eyes laughing, his whole face teasing me, he reached for the sculpture, still wet on the floor, and slapped his hands on it. They were white with wet plaster in no time. He then placed his hands at my temples and stroked down my cheeks, my neck, and onto my shoulders and arms, laughing heartily."I’ve never done body painting before, but I think I might find it quite amusing.”“Oh yes?” I said defiantly, reproducing exactly the same gestures as he had.His beard was now tinged with white plaster and I finally began to relax and laugh. He took more plaster in his hands and put it onto my chest, spreading it over my t-shirt. Again I copied him. The rule of the game was pretty simple. Our hands were taking their time sinking slowly beneath the layers of our clothes that ended flying in the air, one by one. Our mouths never left each other’s for more than a few moments, only when we picked up more white plaster ammunition.Now our bodies were completely naked, in the middle of my studio, and covered with mysterious white drawings – visual evidence of our caresses. I traced his abs with my fingertips, slowly, trying to contract his muscles one by one under my touch. I could feel his skin shiver. He held me in his arms, one hand on my back and the other more adventurous, on my bottom. His way of touching me was always delicate and sensual. Slowly my lips followed the same trail as my hands and I deposited a kiss on the few spaces without plaster. I lowered myself, touching his skin with the tip of my tongue. Carefully, I covered his chest, his stomach and his hips with this gentle touch. My mouth kept contact with his body until it was at the head of his penis. My tongue continued to caress the soft skin of his cock at the same languid pace. My hands stroked his thighs in an attempt to get rid of the white plaster. I heard him exhale loudly. He stroked my hair with his fingers knowing exactly what I was about to do, his whole body imploring me.I took his cock between my lips and let it slide slowly between my tongue and my palate. Holding him, my hand gently accompanied the movement. My other hand pressed on his butt, pulling him closer. I accelerated the rhythm and tightened my mouth’s suction and gripped him even more firmly. I brought him deeper into my throat. His helpless moaning gave me a full sense of power. I was in control of this situation, I was in control of his pleasure.He grabbed my head in his hands and gently stopped me. I looked up at him and saw his eyes shine brightly.“Wait, no, not like that,” he whispered as he knelt before me sitting on his heels.He closed his lips on my neck and wound his arms up around me. Digging furrows, his fingers went down my back, towards my bottom and behind my thighs. He pulled me against him and placed my legs around his waist and, with amazing strength,  seated me on his lap. I took support on my feet behind him, stuck my legs around his butt and my arms around his neck. He lifted me again and slid completely inside of me. He met no resistance, perfectly adjusted. I moaned with anticipation. The previous tension in my stomach had turned liquid, I felt my belly vibrate and flutter.He leaned forward slowly, gently letting me down with his arms, placing my shoulders on the floor while holding the rest of my body in the air. He kissed me, licked me and devoured my breasts. My skin felt electrified. He moved into me with more intense force now, thrusting into me with his entire length. Gracefully he stood up to seat on his heels. He grabbed my lower back with one hand, placing the second on my lower belly. His whole body moved with the rhythm of his thrusts, and every move became more powerful. He guided my body with his hands and my hips took that same frenetic pace. I could feel his back cheeks contracted with each pulse. I would soon lose control and I had to balance myself. I moved my hands behind my head to find some purchase, to push my body to his even more. The resistance that I found was the plaster sculpture. It overlooked us, protecting us in its height.He focused on me intently, his jaws clenching. I was bent back, breasts pointing to the sky. I gasped loudly and all my muscles shook violently. I felt a shock spreading through my body while he plunged into me, almost brutally. His body then tensed and he allowed himself a long groan of pleasure as his orgasm triggered right along with mine.Finally, he withdrew and lay down beside me on the floor. His hand against my jaw, he turned my face to him and caressed my lips with his, breathing warm and gently into my mouth. Lou Reed was now repeating a loop "glory of love, glory of love” that echoed with his melodious guitar.I whispered “I think I like the concept of body painting or sculpturing on living forms.”“Me, too! And now we have a second interest. After all, you must remove all this carefully under the shower,” he said with a greedy look.  "Let’s see where I’m going to start …"The palm of his hand ran along on my stomach following a gritty trail of dry plaster. I began to laugh under his touch, my skin quivering again. I stopped when his hands worked their way to my pubis, his fingers quickly finding my clitoris. Oh no, not already, give me some time, I thought. But I heard my own voice, saying “Oh yes … more!”

Chapter Notes

        See the end of the chapter for  notes




Union Square was crowded in this late afternoon. People took advantage of the remaining sun to stroll under the few trees in this part of the city. The taxi dropped me south of the park, and I now strode through it. My shoes hit the ground making each step sound impatient on the asphalt. The satin of my dress flowed over my skin and floated in the air.I spent my entire afternoon emptying my closet and trying clothes until I found the perfect outfit for our first official date. I usually didn’t pay so much attention to my appearance. Black or blue jeans did the trick for me. Good old 501 Levis, slim or boot cut, whichever was convenient. A simple t-shirt with a picture of David Bowie and Debbie Harry or a white cotton shirt completed my neglected sport-chic look. A pair of converse or flip-flops and I was ready to leave the house.Yet tonight I wanted to be beautiful. I wanted to please. I usually didn’t think my body was very special. I had the same complexes as most woman. I thought my feet were too small and my legs too short. My belly wasn’t flat enough and my breasts not big enough for some and too little for others. My skin was too white and my complexion wasn’t clear enough because of my freckles. I thought my lips were too full and my eyes not blue enough. Lastly, my auburn hair cut like a boy was never well-styled.But over the course of today, I had drained my entire wardrobe of special occasion dresses: little dresses, unavoidably black -- that was my notion of elegance. In the end, I chose the one that I’d bought on a whim and, of course, never dared to wear. It was obviously the sexiest gown I owned.I recalled his eyes gazing at me, those eyes that never left me and made me feel beautiful, naked and desirable. I dreamt about his eyes lingering over my legs which today felt endless under the asymmetrical, diaphanous fabric of my designer dress. It covered half of one leg while the other left nothing to imagination. The opposite shoulder naked as well. The neckline fell to the side and showed off my nape. I remembered his expert lips devouring the base of it. His face behind me, his hand closed on my neck, drawing my head back against him to possess me. The satin of my dress caressed my skin with each of my steps, just as his fingers knew so well how to do it.He waited for me north of the park, standing next to the silver statue of Andy Warhol. The sun glinting on the sculpture threw bluish rays which danced on his blonde curls. He wore tight fit navy blue pants and a blue linen shirt with rolled up sleeves and buttons which threatened to pop open any time. He frowned to protect his eyes from the light. He balanced from one leg to the other like an impatient child. He hadn’t yet seen me, but I stared at him as I went along. Despite my quick pace, I felt as though my legs wouldn’t carry me to him quickly enough. I couldn’t tell if my stomach ached or if it would explode. I wanted to escape and I wanted run to him all at once. Although it was a hot, muggy day, my skin was covered in goose bumps.When he saw me, he froze and his face lit up with a huge bright smile. It had only been a few hours since we parted, but that seemed like forever already. We found ourselves standing in front of each other not knowing what to do and how to react. Suddenly he wound his muscular arms around me and hugged me against him. He buried his face in my neck and I heard him inhaling deeply. He smelled divine. His spicy fragrance was already so familiar to me, and breathing him in made me want him, so much. Then he took me by the hand."Let’s go eat, I'm starving." He said playfully."Me too! " I lied. In my state, I probably couldn’t swallow any food at all.Side by side we walked slowly through the streets of Soho to the restaurant he had chosen. He constantly looked at me from the corner of his eye, a smile on his face. It seems that walking with me meant the world to him, and I felt wings growing.The restaurant was a charming and cozy place. I could to tell he had selected it carefully. He held the door open for me, and stood behind me while to help me with my chair. This English gentleman was a change from every caddish man that I unbearably dated… although to be fair, they weren’t all so bad. There we were sitting face to face at the window overlooking the street. It was becoming hard to meet his gaze. I hid behind the menu, not knowing what to choose and neither, so it seemed, did he. The titles of the dishes were incomprehensible to me. The server literally jumped on us offering daily specials with never-ending names. Tom replied with a smile that we would take our time to make our choices."Tom, I'm sorry, but what's a espuma? " I asked blushing."I have absolutely no idea," he chuckled softly."That’s reassuring!” I said, a little relieved. "It's very nice here, you have chosen well.""Thank you. I am glad you like it!"Apparently I’d told him this with a very confident tone because he answered seriously. Yet I hadn’t truly taken the time to look around me. I had all evening to do so.We talked about the weather, commented on the appearance of passers-by, spoke of people we’d met at the Max’s party. The night slowly replaced the day, and we babbled so much that we only picked at our food. The evening seemed long, almost too long.He managed to tell a few jokes, but they seemed to fall flat and I felt compelled to laugh. He spoke without stopping to fill my silence, which made me feel forced to answer. I felt sorry he had to go on in monologues, these monologues that I found so sexy few hours earlier when our heads were on pillows. His speech almost seemed nervous and confused. I manage to excuse myself to powder my nose on two occasions in order to breathe. In the mirror my eyes were burning, tears threatening to flood.Because our conversation didn’t click, this date seemed like a fiasco. Yet my stomach didn’t loosen and I still trembled so much. Whenever my eyes met his or when I watched his well-drawn cheekbones and happy wrinkles around his eyes, I was melting, wet. I kept my legs crossed all evening to relieve this oppressive feeling between my thighs. His gaze often lingered on my black Louboutin shoe that swung out of the tablecloth. Neither of us took dessert or coffee. He asked almost hesitantly if I still wanted to see his paintings. I told him "Yes," half-polite and half-filled with hope.Back on the dark streets he didn’t reach for my hand. He stood well away, striding forward. I wasn’t nearly as tall as he, even with my high heels -- that now hurt my feet -- so his pace was hard to follow. I discovered that he lived only a few blocks from my loft. On the way we passed a building in demolition. The panels that hid the site were covered with paintings. There on a gray metal fold a black and white graffiti picturing a little girl with a bird stood out from all the other art pieces. It stopped us in our tracks, drawing us together and we peered at it.“Oh my God, it looks like a Banksy!” I shouted.“That’s impossible! Do you really think that he's in New York?” he said excited.“Why not? You might not be the only English artist in town!” I joked.He laughed the first real, unforced laugh of the evening. I began to review the design and the particular traits of the artist; he bounced on his feet at my words, echoing my enthusiasm. Now we acted like two children trying to remember all the details. Pictures of the graffiti were taken, then of course, selfies: alone, in pairs, with or without grins, standing, sitting and even one of Tom doing a handstand. He grabbed out his cell phone and tweeted the news: "there is a Banksy in Soho!" Afterward, we started running like fools knowing that the work would probably be looted and auctioned by the next morning.He sang, “We found a Banksy” and allowed himself a victory dance rocking his hips. He took my hand and made me twirl and sway.“Come on, let's do something unusual. I'll show you some cool stuff.” I said, and ran, forgetting my sore feet.Down the street there was a building that I knew well. I owned the entrance key and access code. I motioned him to be quiet by placing my hand over his mouth and directed him to bend down and hide in front of the concierge desk. We had to keep from laughing while walking on all fours. I had to admit that moving behind him was quite a pleasant view. On the other side of the door in the staircase, I pulled off my shoes and started to climb the stairs.“Where are we going?” He asked.“To the roof!” I repliedTom stood still on the spot staring at the endless column of steps above him. “And how many stories are there?”“Around twenty, but don’t worry! We’ll take the lift after the first floor.”He seemed relieved and followed me, overtook me and grabbed my shoes on the way as if to challenge me to race and retrieve them. We were already out of breath when we reached the elevator. Our laughter quickly gave way to an odd silence only cut by our deep breaths. Each of us leaned against opposite walls, our eyes fixed in each other, full of implication. Tom held my shoes tight against his torso like two trophies.On the rooftop, a huge and colorful New York blazed its lights at us. The Empire State Building seemed as close as the reach of a hand. The sounds of the city were almost imperceptible and, the vision fading out in the distance. Although this roof terrace was not on the highest skyscraper in New York, the view was breathtaking.“How do you know this place?” He asked, amazed.“I had the opportunity to do an exhibition on this roof. I was sure you'd like it.”“It’s magnificent!” He said, clinging to the parapet. "But, not as much as you…”Yes, it was a cliché, but I really wanted to hear these words. I grabbed him by his collar and pulled him against me. I slammed my lips against his, forcing my tongue in his mouth to seek for his. The taste of his kisses intoxicated me and I realized that I was starving for them. He brushed his hands against my skin, under my dress, cupped my butt and lifted me to sit on the roof edge. My legs enfolded around him to hold him close to me while my mouth found the protruding vein on his neck, that same vein I always nibbled greedily. The spicy taste of his skin made me feel drunk.Tom threw his head back and moaned. His fingers rambled over my skin launching electric waves through my body. He quickly removed my dress over my head. He then kissed my naked eager breasts, my nipples peaking hard. I could feel his erect cock in his pants and I rubbed him with my palm. My nimble fingers unbuttoned his fly and I released his already engorged and firm length. Feeling the contact of the air on his naked cock he bit my teats and pulled on then. I sketched a cry and tightened my legs around his waist. His hand dived under the lace of my panties and he rolled his fingers on my clit while my palm rounded his shaft and stroked."Oh, Heaven, you're so warm and wet."It was obvious I had waited all-day long. I had been ready for him since the moment he left me late this morning. I never stopped thinking about him and my body burned for him."Tom, fuck me," I implored. I didn’t care if it sounded vulgar, grotesque or passionate. All I wanted was to feel him in me, now, urgently.He pulled on my panties and tore them away, leaving a red mark on my skin. He moved his hips against me spreading my legs wider to penetrate inside me forcefully, instantly. His arms held me firmly back above the void. He leaned over me to kiss my breasts while plugging into me with all his strength. My head swung backwards into the 20-floor space above the street. Never mind if we could be seen or heard.“Fuck! Anne-Lisa, you're so tight and sweet,” he groaned.I begged again, “Oh yes, Tom…more …harder!”He granted my wish by grinding into me with a powerful rhythm. His lower belly rubbed my clitoris within each movement. His pelvis and muscular butt tightened intensely. He was already growling. His deep voice resonated in my ear along with the sound of our skin slapping together. I answered, moaning, unable to control myself.My body trembled all over when he came hard in me. I felt and heard him tense up in a roar. It only took me few seconds to burst in a noisy and monumental orgasm. My thighs twitched around him and my feet strained in the air. This pleasure had managed to scramble every of my muscles and I was shaking in Tom’s arms 200 feet above the ground. His dark-blue eyes stared at me as if magnetized by my body. His smile showed that he knew that he was the one responsible for my helpless condition.I got up and hugged his chest against me breathlessly.“Oh gorgeous, we are crazy!” I sighed.He surrounded me in his strong arms, keeping me safe against his torso, compressing my ribs. He laughed in my ear.“Yes, we are, Heaven. But it was so good! By the way, do you still want to come see my paintings?”I answered, my head buried in his neck and my hands clamped to him. “Yes, eventually!”

They were the sea. They were water. They were a bright and cloudless sky. Tom’s paintings were like the sea. I recognized the color of his eyes, a sparkling and quiet light blue with darker shades deep and penetrating, water glimmering under the sun with green, gray and purple splinters. It was his vision of life in all its aspects with its storms and tumults and also its softness and calm sunset.But his paintings didn’t represent anything in particular. They were abstract. He painted feelings. They were intense, nuanced, delicate and violent all at once. How was he able to represent these using only simple colors? He added paints and pigments on canvas as if they were thick organic material. Their textures were dense and every brush and knife movement was transmitted onto the cloth like a caress or a slap. I could perceive the motion of his soft hands or tense muscles sculpting colors and forming a design. I imagined him creating with his whole body in action, this body that I now knew so well. His art was like his image: alive, powerful and vibrant.I stood in a corner of his living room in the space near the window he had reserved for his work. I was in his world and I was very slowly sliding into it with delight and wonder. I could read him, his soul was revealed to me. His paintings represented him in his whole complexity. I suddenly understood why Max wanted me to work with him. I then realized why I was so attracted by Tom. We had the same views, the same absolute will of expression, sincerity and sensuality. We were identical.Tom gazed at me with questioning azure eyes. He scrutinized each of my moves, all of my reactions. Yet I didn’t know how to express myself -- how to tell him or show him the way I was affected by his work.He approached me cautiously. “What’s your opinion?”“I can’t find the right words! Amazing or fantastic seem a bit weak.”“Really? Do you like them? Somehow I felt you'd be the only one to understand what I’m trying to express. I'm not sure that I’ve completely managed to do it. You're so much more talented in creating and transcribing these kinds of things. I am constantly amazed by your sculptures. They talk to me. They guide me. I’d love to have that kind of power, but I’m far from it" he said tenderly, his admiring eyes fixed on mine."You’re acquainted with my sculptures?!" I exclaimed, shocked.He reached out to me to stroke my cheek."Of course. I’m one of your biggest fans. When Max told me you'd be at his party and I saw you standing next to your sculpture, I ..."He didn’t have time to finish his sentence. I had pushed violently away.“You already knew when we first met! The first time we…” I almost choked on my words.Now it seemed the earth had opened under my feet and threatened to swallow me. I understood that he actually had known who I was before we met, while I had no clue to his identity. He was still a stranger to me during our first intimate moment together, but I wasn’t a stranger to him.I felt shame now, afraid that I had unveiled too much of me too soon. I felt betrayed, confused. He tried to hold me, his face completely baffled. But I retreated before him. I wanted to flee. I wanted to scream and slap him. I wanted to forget everything.I ran out of his apartment and slammed the door. I left him standing in the middle of his living room completely dazed. I rushed down the stairs blindly, tears filling my eyes. I heard him shout my name and run to the landing door to catch me. I didn’t answer him, even when I heard him yell again and beg me to stay while I stumbled into the street.***Three days had passed since that night. Tom had the decency not to pursue me and I had retreated to my loft and locked myself away. However, he did try to contact me. My phone didn’t stop ringing and he left messages until my mailbox was full. Then SMS followed at regular intervals. Whenever I saw his name on the screen, I shook. I wanted to respond, but I always ended up bursting into tears. I didn’t listen or read any of his messages.These days were jumbled and confused, and my thoughts were a complete blur. All sorts of feelings about him jostled in my mind – from the moment we had first met in Max’s loft until now. I felt the whole emotional palette of the world, down to the very depths of me. And he was the one responsible.Betrayal was the prevailing sentiment, or at least it was the foundation for my hurt feelings. I had wanted so much that our first time together be same for both of us. I needed us to be two foreigners driven toward each other by an invisible and irresistible force. But that wasn’t the case. He knew who I was and now I blushed because I had been so stupid and naive. I was ashamed of myself that I went so far and completely abandoned myself to him. But, at the time, I adored it. I loved the way he was able to make me let go, to bring me to my limits. I liked that my body took over my mind. And I loved that he had turned me into someone fearless. I loved losing control. But I was frightened, too.The feeling I had of knowing him for a long time was unreal. My body sensed things and my mind seemed to understand who he was through his paintings. But was it true? At the end I knew nothing of this man.We really didn’t manage to communicate at all, at least verbally. Our bodies grasped each other perfectly, but we didn’t. So I was especially angry at myself. I never succeed in speaking. I didn’t know how to let him come to me. But him, he could talk bluntly, he knew how to speak, the words were so beautiful and so right in his mouth. I felt helpless and inadequate.What do we have in common? Apparently nothing! Apparently everything!I felt these famous butterflies in my stomach, this anticipation and desire. I also sensed a bond, a connection, and had felt so much pleasure with him. But envy, absence and emptiness had also invaded me. At his side, I had managed to feel free and light. We had laughed, we had talked a bit and we had cuddled a lot. With him I had felt alive, and now I felt like I was dying.For two nights I didn’t really sleep, but I stayed in my bed, curled up in pain. Last night I emptied the rest of a bottle of vodka to numb myself. This worked, because I hadn’t had anything to eat since our dinner at the restaurant. Alcohol on an empty stomach was radical. I remained stunned for four hours, and this morning I had an awful hangover. I couldn’t stop crying. My skin had taken on a sickly hue, and my eyes were swollen. I didn’t want to hear from him ever again, and I also missed him enough to die from want of him.I was in a comatose state when the intercom buzzed, a delivery. The elevator set in motion and I had to answer dressed in a black T-shirt so big it reached my knees. I hadn’t been expecting a package. But the delivery guy brought me five large bags loaded on a wheel trolley. They were fabric bags each containing forty pounds of different types of clay: porcelain, paper clay, gumbo, white or black clay. I used all of these in distinct ways for my work. Each of their properties during and after the sculpting process rendered them unique and technical.On each bag was written in blue paint: “I am sorry!”I began to tremble. I wanted to vomit. Damned hangover! Damned heartache! I needed air. I needed to breathe.I went to the window ready to open it, and then I saw him in the shadows leaning up against the wall of the opposite sidewalk. He was wearing shapeless black sweatpants and an old t-shirt of the same color. His face was marked by sadness but he looked no less gorgeous, even in his casual attire. His sorrowful eyes were set on the windows of my apartment. When he saw me he stiffened, but continued to stare at me without knowing what to do. I hurtled to hide behind a pillar in the center of the loft. I sat on the floor, well secluded. My mobile started ringing again. I guessed that was he, but I didn’t answer.An hour later, the intercom buzzed again. I was still sitting on the floor head between my knees. But I had no more tears to cry. A new delivery brought me flowers. That was predictable. Yet, I did not expect these. Atop the cart sat a bouquet of a hundred giant white callas, my favorite flower. I had often carved them in this pure and pristine color. A sealed letter was stuck at the center of the bouquet.Angrily, I walked toward the bay window with the letter in my hand. He was still there, motionless, the look on his face increasingly defeated. I eyed him scornfully from my perch and tore the letter in two, then four, in front of his stricken eyes. He rushed forward, crying out helplessly. I saw his lips pronouncing my name.He crossed the street without paying attention and nearly got knocked down. If he thought I was going to open the door from the intercom, he was dreaming. But no bell rang out and the lift began to move almost immediately. Max, that traitor, must have given him the entrance code. The elevator stopped at my floor, and Tom’s fists hammered on the metal door. He yelled and begged from behind it.“Anna-Lisa, I beg of you. Let me talk to you. Let me explain. Read my letter, please ... Anna-Lisa!”His voice broke and he began to weep. I could clearly hear his heavy sobs from my position behind my mainstay. I couldn’t resist unfolding what was left of the letter and put it back together like a puzzle.
“My sweet Heaven,

You may think that I am a very good talker, but today I don’t know how to express what I feel. Within days you became my heaven on earth. Maybe I have died without realizing it. I think you stabbed me in the heart and now I am living and dying for you.

Since the day I found one of your sculptures in a small gallery in London, I haven’t ceased to imagine meeting you. I wanted to share my work and discover more about yours. I wanted to share our visions, receive your advice and understand your inspiration. It would have been a simple meeting between artists. I never thought that a party in New York would be the moment that I met you. But that night I met a woman. And now, most of all, I have the strong desire to know this woman -- to be with her and protect her. I am sorry. I didn’t realize that you didn’t know who I was at that moment. I can only guess how it might be strange to meet someone who recognizes you, but you remain a stranger to him. I never wanted to cheat or take advantage of the situation. I did not, do not and will never wish to hurt you.

I know you're scared that you can’t control yourself, and that you don’t understand what’s happening to you. I feel exactly the same way. But what I feel is so strong, so intense and so sudden that I can’t resist it. I'm sure neither can you? Like you, I don’t know what it is, but let us experience it together. Let me help you, support you and be with you to live through this.

You are already part of my life. I can’t let you go like this.

Forgive me! Love me, badly or clumsily if necessary, but love me even for a moment, just a moment longer ... Because my body has you under its skin and my mind is crazy about you.

I beg you, Heaven.

Tom”
At that moment nothing else mattered. He was waiting behind my door and I needed him. My body didn’t feel any pain, my eyes weren’t burning anymore and my legs were carrying me toward him. My reason had packed its bags for good.When the metal door rose, two powerful arms drew me into the small space of the elevator. Tom hugged me tightly and buried his face in my neck.“I'm so sorry, Heaven, forgive me!” He pleaded.“It doesn’t matter anymore ... I missed you so much,” I answered quietly.“So did I, I was sick without you!”He pushed me against the metal grate of the elevator, scrambling down upon me, mouth glued to mine. It was not a kiss, but scarcity, relief, passion and desire. I clung to his shoulders, running a hand on his neck then into his blond curls. I couldn’t hold a sigh. His movements stilled. His lips brushed against mine, and I felt his breath in my mouth. I longed for him to fill me with his breath. He nuzzled my cheek, and then deposited soft kisses on my eyelids. I felt the muscles of his arm tighten under my grip. His hands crept under my shirt and lifted it over my head. I did the same with his. His chest pressed against mine. Although my skin was crushed against the gate of the lift, I didn’t notice the cold metal. I felt his skin, fingers and lips stroking me and kissing my neck. My skin felt as though it was on fire.I closed my eyes and leaned my head back, moaning, pressing my body against him. His hands were everywhere at once. His mouth was insistent. His kisses were running on my skin, from my neck to my chest. He bluntly kneaded at my bosoms, then pulled one of my nipples into his lips and eagerly lapped at it. He moaned, not satisfied. I dug my nails into his shoulders, arching my back to fill his mouth with my nipples that he sucked and nibbled. He was the only one to make me feel this way, and I had almost let him go.My body remembered everything he did to me in the library on our first night. But today he was even bolder, even greedier, as if his tongue wanted to penetrate into my skin. I felt wet and hot; I felt his soft lips, his frantic fingers and his silken beard tickling my skin. His desire was alive and ran in every of his movements. He wanted me, his Heaven.His trailed kissed down my body. He settled on my belly for a while. Slowly stroking my navel with his lips and fingertips. I was shivering already. Then he proceeded toward my center again, where I need him, where I wanted him more than anything.“Oh, Tom...” I whimpered, holding tight to the elevator grating.His hands fondled my hips and my butt and I begged again. “Tom, please.” But my panties stayed in place. He teased me, his fingers only brushed against my inner thighs. His kiss followed the same path, and his palms hugged my leg down to my knee.Suddenly he raised up and turned me against the grating, pinning his body against my back. The metal compressed my breasts, and I yelled out with pleasure.‘Yes, Heaven, moaned for me.” he murmured into my ear.Tom get to the base of my neck and nibbled.His voice deep, he said “You're mine. Beg for me.” “Oh please, Tom, I want you, I'm yours. Take me now. Please!” I was mad with desire.“Patience, Heaven!”His mouth slowly trailed to my back, his hands caressing my breasts and my belly. He lingered for a long time on my bottom and put his fingers under the fabric of my panties to gently circle my clitoris. I spread my legs wider and pushed my butt back. He finally took off my underwear.He knelt down and repositioned me to face him. I grabbed his hair to pull him. He lifted my legs one after the other to place them on his shoulders, and he held us both in place with his hands against the grid. His face buried into me. When his tongue parted my lips to surround my clit, I almost lost balance, as I had to cling to the grating. My knuckles whitened with the strain while pleasure rose inside me.Tom knew how to make me react. He knew the perfect pace. He knew how to caress me with his tongue, slowly, softly, changing the pressure, seeking the sensitive points. He thrust two fingers into me, my juices suddenly flowing on his hands. He gently rubbed my inner walls with his fingers, just on the right spot, with the right intensity. He was drinking my liquid, thirsty, like a bear with a honey pot. He groaned heavily, delighted. I moved my hips toward him when he grabbed my cheeks again and gave a last lick that sent me to seventh heaven. This intense wave of pleasure fell on me and drew from me a hoarse cry.“Oh yes Heaven ... I want to make you come undone like that, forever.”And then we heard someone rattle the lift doors on the ground floor and howl:“Enough now, get a room, and release the elevator!” 



Do you trust me?

My loft had always been my refuge, a safe place to create. It was a large industrial space: bare concrete, no dividers and a high ceiling. Tall sashed windows boxed the room around on three sides. I didn’t own much furniture. A simple mattress on the floor marked the bedroom. The fitted kitchen along one wall was complete with a small table and four chairs. My living room was a few large cushions idly tossed onto a Persian rug. The bathroom consisted of a shower, sink, and toilet against one wall, and I hadn’t yet screened it off with a divider. A vintage bathtub sat in state almost in the center of the room. My home really wasn’t designed for visitors. I had planned it as my studio, and now my work occupied the whole space.Today, though, I finally had company. Tom lounged in the tub, playing with soap, the foam bubbling up between his long fingers. His hair appeared darker due to being wet and his curls were slicked back, giving him a Stygian appearance. I had plenty of time to admire this view as I sat in the giant tub with him, facing him, up to my shoulders in the warm bubbly water. His legs were bent on either side of me, forming a comfortable barricade for me. My fingers strolled fondly along his calves and knees. I tickled his chest with my feet, playfully caressing his torso, his neck and even his jaw with my big toe. He laughed and retaliated by nibbling on my toes. He then held my foot still, massaging the sole, while I exhaled exaggerated moans of pleasure to tease him.Since he’d last entered my door, we had made love several times -- violently in the beginning, and then more gently and voluptuously. We completely and blissfully abandoned ourselves to each other: embracing, kissing and cuddling between each moment of ecstasy. And we simply talked about what happened, what we felt.Afterward we talked about him. I listened closely. I drank in every one of his words, voluntary trapped between the desire to know him and the desire inspired by his sweet and deep voice.He had grown up in Oxford alongside two sisters. His parents had divorced when he was still a young teenager. This separation had a great impact on him and he felt that his idea of everlasting love had been shattered. Nevertheless he still wanted to experience this great love story, this ultimate love, even if it seemed more difficult. He wished to know if I could be this ideal. He knew that love is a perilous thing. He knew that hearts could be hurt, but it was worth the risk. He described his vision and intent to love me perfectly, gently, while stroking my legs.We had much more in common than art. Our families were both middle class. He’d studied at Cambridge and I at Columbia, where he now taught. His elegant and warm manners fascinated me. In contrast to him, my ways were more secretive, snappier. In art, I sculpted forms strangely like him in their purity and delicacy, but any fragility they had was mine. His paintings were wild and untamed like me, while their vitality or serenity was his.I’m usually shy in relationships. But instead of scaring me off, the way Tom opened up was soothing to me. It was such a relaxing sensation to be in the bath with him, feeling so natural. I felt secure and confident.I breathed in the sandalwood aroma of the bubble bath. This earthy perfume always had a comforting effect on me, but would now be forever associated with him, and I found this idea held a strange appeal. In that moment he could have asked for anything; I would have done it. But he wanted more than my body --Tom was searching for my soul."Tell me about your family," he inquired intent on my answer as if it would change his world."I had a brother and parents." I revealed, hesitating, my eyes fixed on the surface of the water.He looked at me puzzled and I continued "Jimmy was two years older than me. He died of leukemia when I was eight. I remember that day very well. I was also hospitalized when my parents gave me the worst news ever. I just had donated bone marrow to Jimmy, but he died from complications on the operating table. I recall my mother sitting on the edge of my bed unable to look at me. Even years later, she seemed unable to see me anymore. I thought all along that she blamed me. And I used to feel guilty for not saving my brother. I hadn’t wanted the surgery, so I figured it was my fault, as if I’d poisoned the marrow with my thoughts.”Tears dropped onto my cheeks. Tom gently closed his comforting hands around my feet."I’m so sorry… But it wasn’t your fault," he said quietly, obviously affected."I know, of course, but I was only eight. My parents weren’t the same afterward. My mother closed in on herself and my father avoided us. He buried himself in his work, spending as little time as possible at home. They might have divorced too, but I think they were too afraid of being alone. Our family was only living side by side, never crossing paths, never really together."A look from Tom’s moist eyes pierced me. I could feel his concern and compassion; I could tell he was looking for a way to comfort me. He gazed at me and touched me. His fingers seemed to rock me and ease me.I continued. "A few months before my 18th birthday, we were in a car accident. My parents were quarreling as usual and my father lost control of the vehicle. They died almost instantly. I was in the backseat, and remember my mother looking at me… finally seeing me. From the time Jimmy died until then, she hadn’t properly seen me."I had to break off. I was crying and couldn’t stop. I felt as though a hard lump was lodged in my throat. I had never told anyone this story. I’d avoided even thinking about it for fear of falling apart. But for some reason, I needed to explain it to this man, at that time.Tom moved toward me, a tear rolling down his cheek. He gently caught my jaw with his fingertips; leaning forward to kiss me, comfort me. But suddenly, I cringed from his touch and hurried out of the tub. I picked up a bath towel and wrapped it around me, and stood in tears, dripping on the concrete floor."Anna-Lisa, no, don’t do this. Don’t turn away from me….!” he said, frustrated and sad."I’m sorry, Tom, it’s not your fault. I don’t think you should be with me. Anyone who gets close to me inevitably goes away."I turned to face the mirror, unable to watch him try to gain some control over my tears."My Heaven, I am not leaving you. I want to be with you. Just let me be near you and protect you. If you let your fear take over, it will paralyze you and isolate you. Just allow me to reach you." he said in a calm and determined voice."Oh, Tom, I feel good with you, I really do. But I don’t know how to…” I froze, so tired."I can help you. I want to help you. Just trust me," he implored. From the mirror’s view, I could see his arm stretch toward me. When I grabbed it and slid my hand into his I felt his presence, here with me, more than ever. I turned and stared at him, stroking his temples, highlighting his wrinkles at the corners of the eyes with my fingertips."I do trust you. I need to!"He drew me powerfully to him, and I tumbled into the bathtub scrambling down in his arms. I couldn’t restrain a cry of astonishment, and a big wave splashed onto the floor.He laughed. Something had utterly yielded in me. I fell. I plunged into his arms. I didn’t resist and now I was sinking slowly, mentally and physically. He crushed his lips onto mine. His kisses always gave me the same effect, shivering with a touch of delightful pain. But they were even tenderer, more protective and more intense than usual. He tasted so sweet, so mesmerizing and soothing, the gentle taste of his skin, the taste of a man. My man. I melted into him. This contact awakened my obvious desire to be with him. My fingers brushed against his face and downy beard."Just a moment, gorgeous!" I stepped out of the water."Where are you going? " he tried to hold me.I could feel his eyes lingering over my naked body as I walked away from him. I didn’t want to be away from him for long. I came back quickly, hiding behind my back the things I had recovered from the cabinet above the sink."Do you trust me?" I asked. “I want to see you completely."I also needed to regain control over myself just for a moment."Uhmm-hmm" he confirmed with intrigued and curious eyes.I placed a razor and shaving cream on the edge of the bathtub and stepped back into the hot water. I stood a moment in front of him so he could admire me and lay his hands on my hips. He looked at me from below, trailing his greedy eyes over my body. I could feel his desire. I slowly lowered to enjoy the light touch of his hands on my skin. I took my time to sit on his thighs. My fingers played over his chest and wet abs. His erect cock just tickled my crotch and I let it slide gently on my clit. He gasped with pleasure. I settled for only rubbing his length slowly, torturing him a bit. But the craving to feel him inside me was almost unbearable. So I finally allowed him to dive in me, moaning in his ear. He was set deep within me. After a leisurely moment I settled myself down. I gently stroked his tight muscles before grabbing the shaving gel. Our mouths rejoined while he fondled my back. I softly bit his lower lip and meticulously applied foam on his beard. He hardened in me, and I sensed his impatience. I was quietly shaking around him. He tried to move me up by lifting my hips. And I did so gradually, only to put the shaving cream back and grab the razor.I pulled myself up almost completely and then slide back on him in a languid rhythm. His inhaled sharply and wrapped his long hands around my butt, massaging my muscles deeply, exciting me. I somehow found the strength to remain composed and still, impaled on his glorious cock. I had to stay in control…"Please, Heaven!" He begged."Don’t move or I’ll cut you," I ordered.He obeyed and didn’t even complain that his scruff was about to disappear. This torture was soft and pleasant for him. I cautiously slid the blade on his neck up to his jaw. He kept his head back, breathing hard. After that first razor stroke, I tightened my muscles around his cock and he reacted instantly, stirring."Shh, shh, be careful!" I hushed, lustfully.“Oh my God!” he whispered.I began to shave his throat and then his face very precisely, tracing every razor stroke with my fingers. From time to time I shifted so he could probe my pussy further. I went slowly even though my desire was almost intolerable. His eyes were on fixed on me and his hands rested quietly on my lower back. He didn’t move; he stayed still inside me. I became increasingly aware of his male fragrance, and the combined smell of him plus the shaving cream was intoxicating. I finished shaving him close by his temples, and eliminated the last of his beard. My wet fingertips wiped the remaining traces of foam from his face.I was finally able to see his perfectly aligned facial planes, his chiseled cheekbones and a square jaw which gave him an appearance of softness mixed with an elusive virile strength. I lingered over his eyebrows, his nose and his thin, fully revealed lips. His beauty was fascinating to me. I could have sculpted this silhouette myself, so pure and intense. Just the sight of him was perfect, my world was complete and my body was burning like Hell.He slid his hands along my back and pulled me in toward him, to find my mouth with his and kiss me again. He smelled like shaving foam and sandalwood. I felt as though my lips would dissolve under his kisses. My hips bucked and swayed out of control, my whole body rolling faster and faster. His pelvis answered every stroke creating small tsunamis in the tub. Water splashed onto the floor around us. I gripped his head with my forearms while my fingers brushed through his hair. He buried his shining face in my neck and the contact of simple flesh was softer and more exciting than ever before. I knew he would burn me to cinders.Each beat of my heart came quicker and brought me exulting lust. I wanted more and I moaned. My skin quivered and my muscles tensed. I gasped. His pleasure was palpable. He grunted my name before biting down on my shoulder. Our bodies were inseparable. His pelvis swiveled tightly onto my clitoris. Tom stiffened completely and then he poured himself into me. He groaned in contentment, even louder than usual. His throaty vocalizations sparked a flurry of jolts that shook all my muscles. I clenched him tighter in full agony.Hugging, anchored into each other arms, it was impossible to separate us at that moment."Tom, there is only one heart in this body, please take care of it, will you?" I whispered."Trust me and let me catch you if you fall. I will protect your heart so it doesn’t break into pieces. I promise."I would never get tired of this, never get tired of this new man and the confidence that I longed to give him with my whole soul. He would keep me from retreating, I finally believed it.

Chapter Notes
WARNINGS/TRIGGERS/AUTHOR NOTES: Straight unprotected sexFEEDBACK/COMMENTS: After all the emotions of the previous chapters, we needed a little lightness and humor. But I think I got a little carried away with the sex scene. Thank you to my beta-reader @quoting-shakespeare-to-ducks and with a special dedication to @eve1978 (she'll understand. She was the only one who answered my posted request.) Inspiration from this quote: “She asked him to make her come with his tongue, so he reads her poems.” Copyright - 00062229-1



We had only separated a few hours ago and it already seemed like an eternity. I felt I was missing a part of me. I quivered uncontrollably with childish ‘butterflies’ at the thought of seeing him again. Tom and I had a rendezvous scheduled for late afternoon, as usual, a happy ritual that I was almost accustomed to. But this time it was a business meeting. Max was waiting for us in his apartment to discuss a project that we should do together.I was dying to work with Tom. Imagining our two artistic universes coming together was very exciting for me. I really wanted to trust him. This was a new feeling for me, and it’s surprising to discover that I could trust him - in some ways. But allowing him to come closer to my inner world was frightening. That Tom would discover the very personal way I conceived my art was more intimidating to me than our wildest sexual encounters.Right now the person who concerned me the most was dear Max. He’s usually very insightful, and he knew me by heart. I was certain he would notice something right away, and I didn’t know what Tom had told him. There was no real reason why our relationship should be a secret, but I wanted us to linger in our bubble. Letting Max step in seemed too soon and a little complicated. So it had been a Chinese puzzle to find the perfect outfit, casual and relaxed enough so Max would not clue in, and sexy enough for Tom to stay under my spell. I finally settled on slim black jeans, a black asymmetric cardigan and heels of a reasonable height. At least if I had the appearance of an elegant, strong and feminine artist, maybe I could avoid blushing.Max opened his door with a huge welcoming smile. He wore straight black pants and a black shirt closely fit to his body, with three buttons carelessly undone to show off his weight lifting built pectorals. His put-together and trim appearance made me suspect he almost certainly had a new man in his life. And, unfortunately, our outfits almost matched. Perhaps I had just betrayed myself after all.“Hello, my darling, you look beautiful today! To what do I owe the pleasure of seeing you in high-heels? Did you lose your Converses?” he exclaimed with his eternal smile.“And maybe you think you’re Jared Leto?” I threw back at him with an artful dodge.Max waved at me to follow him to his living room. At last week’s party, the furniture had been moved away to make room, but now had found its way back. At the center were two large sofas and two armchairs in anthracite suede which offered an ideal relaxation area in front of a beautiful view of New York. Tom was quietly installed in an armchair wearing light gray trousers, white shirt and gray jacket, sipping a cup of tea. When did Max start keeping tea at home? And when did he acquire that English tea set?The chair was an excellent choice for Tom, because I didn’t think I could resist him if I sat next to him on a sofa. Moreover, he had a perfect view of my sculpture on his left and of me on his right. The sun across the bay window lit up his smooth face, now beardless. I was the one responsible for that, and the memory of shaving him in the bathtub stirred me. But his new flawless and clean haircut wasn’t of my doing. He turned his incomparable eyes to me, and I began to shiver. There were no more butterflies in my stomach, but a flight of migrating swallows.“Isn’t he beautiful, our Tom, with this new look?” asked a playful Max.“Oh thanks, man! You are so kind to say that!” Tom replied with a proud smile aimed at me. “The haircut was a command from your sister, Mrs. Dresher. She thought that my curls, without the beard, made me look younger than my students. So she insisted I see the barber.”“So, are women deciding about your style now?” I questioned Tom as seriously as possible.“Evidently, they are! But I prefer that they undress me.” he said setting his piercing blue eyes on me.I tried to laugh, but this thought gave me even more chills. I sent myself an internal reminder to act more naturally, otherwise we would be caught.Max replied, seeming not to notice my embarrassment, “I’m sure they love to do that!”And an always easygoing Tom said, still looking at me, “Well, some women have more fun with that than others!”I felt myself begin to blush from head to toe, and crossed my legs to relieve the growing longing at my core. I fidgeted on my seat trying to find a laid-back position. Nevertheless Max was still completely blind to my discomfort.“So, you’ve become acquainted since last week. Tom told me that you met.”“Hum … yes we did.” I said down in my rabbit hole.Max had mentioned this without any double meaning, but the situation remained dangerous.“Indeed, we took our time to get very acquainted.” specified the painter.I glared at Tom. Max wasn’t born yesterday! But Tom seemed to love seeing me blush and displayed a big satisfied smile.Our agent pursued, still without understanding anything.“Darling, do you want some tea? We need to honor my guest from the other side of Atlantic!”“Max, old sport, let me serve.” proposed Tom, getting up to grab the teapot and fill my cup. Would I have to tell him that I didn’t even like tea?“It will be my pleasure to admire your authentic English technique. That might be quite sophisticated.” Max answered, flirtatious.I watched them both and had a revelation. Max wasn’t going to notice or tease me about anything going on between me and Tom, as he might usually. He was completely dazzled by Tom. My friend was trying to steal my man right in front of my nose! I suddenly wanted to burst out laughing. My fears of exposing our secret were gone. This was almost exciting. Of course there wasn’t any competition possible. I would win. But now I wanted to play for a while. I also know the practice of subtle innuendo and I would tease both of them for a bit -- a cunning plan.“Max, I didn’t know you had such an interest in the habits and customs of the English countryside’s rolling hills and its charming servants.”I eyed them slyly with a mischievous smile.“It’s an occupational hazard, watching such beautiful painter’s hands in action. Can you imagine what other things they can do?” Max replied and grasped Tom’s wrist warmly.“I can imagine it perfectly!” I said, settling my gaze on Tom. “I do know your love of art, dear Max. But you can let go of him now.”Everyone seemed to understand what he wanted to hear. Max especially got that I wouldn’t make his subtle little game of seduction any easier. He continued in a more professional tone.“I have invited you today to talk about the next Venice Biennale. They want to promote art with emphasis on multidisciplinary artists. I thought to offer them a unique masterpiece, the result of collaboration between a sculptor and a painter. This should be an original idea.”“It is a really great idea!” I exclaimed. “Good thing that Tom has already said that he appreciates my art.”“It would indeed be a true pleasure to work with her.” Tom replied.“This is perfect, kids! Of course, Tom is not as famous as you, sweetie. I hope you won’t mind that he uses you for publicity?”“On the contrary, I have no objection if a promising young artist uses me. It would delight me to be responsible for increasing his reputation.” Tom had to stifle a giggle as I stared at Max with a devilish grin.“Well then! I am pleased to hear you’ll cooperate. And, it would give me the opportunity to see you more often!” said Max, was trying to attract the Englishman’s attention simpering like a schoolgirl.“Max, my dear, I know you well. You’ll certainly be happier to see this gentleman, rather than me!”Max laughed and Tom wiggled on his seat, his face adorable and embarrassed. Finally, he’d understood that Max had been trying to chat him up. I forgave him readily; I knew that he only had eyes for me.“Max, I’m very flattered.” Tom replied. “Unfortunately I don’t have the pretense to say I never mix business and pleasure, because it’s a little too late now. I must confess that Anna-Lisa and I have met, intimately. And I sincerely mean us to become more serious.”Perplexed, Max rubbed one hand on his completely bald head.“My God, I’m such a fool… But actually I’m glad that this little wild creature has finally been seduced,” he said, pointing toward me with his chin. “I hope, my darling that you aren’t angry that I tried.”“Not at all. It was even fun to watch. And honestly, I think I understand you.” I undressed Tom with my eyes. He was so gorgeous and royal, as usual.We three burst out laughing, which lightened the mood. I’d been afraid that Max would unveil us and at the end - I was relieved. Our bubble was intact. The news went off without a hitch and in a good mood.We sat and talked, agreeing on the terms of our future collaboration. We had two months to complete an original piece, during which Tom would occupy my studio, which was larger and more comfortable to work in. He would, however, continue to teach in parallel. We all understood that he wouldn’t spend much time at his home anymore. Max didn’t fail to point this out suddenly in innuendo. Revenge is a dish best served cold.***It was already dark when Tom opened the door of his apartment. I’d come with to help him carry a few belongings. While he was preparing a suitcase, I walked around his flat. His smell was everywhere. When I closed my eyes I could feel his presence, spices, vanilla and lime, a typical fragrance emphasizing his elegance and virility. I would never get tired of it.His apartment was small and everything was studiously placed: the paintings in shades of blue, a comfortable masculine lounge in leather and a huge bookshelf. It was less substantial than Max’s, but the books were no less prestigious; an edition of the complete works of Shakespeare, Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey, Plato’s Symposium, Seneca, Socrates, Kant, Nietzsche, collections of poems, sonnets and English authors mostly, Charles Dickens, Graham Green, Somerset Maugham, Lord Byron, James Joyce, Jane Austen, the Brontë sisters, Agatha Christie, Daphne Du Maurier, George Orwell, JC Ballard, Joseph Conrad, Arthur Conan Doyle, Rudyard Kipling, TE Lawrence, Oscar Wilde, HG Wells, Anthony Burgess, John Fowles, etc. There were also a few American writers from Arthur or Henry Miller, Tennessee Williams to Mark Twain; and some French ones: Dumas, Molières and Jules Verne in original versions. It was an impressive collection of intellectual nourishment and dreams. I laid a finger on the covers of his books, admiring.     “So, is it in these books that you find your inspiration, your bold way of approach me and your self-confidence?” I asked him.“What do you mean by bold?” he replied from his bathroom, busy filling a toiletry bag - a ‘sponge bag’ as he would say in his Londoner English.“Well, you generally touched me in a very daring way.” I explained a bit flushed. “You have this uncanny ability to act on my fantasies, even those I didn’t know I had in me. And I follow you helplessly, because you breathe a sort of assurance. I was just wondering if this came from your heroes, those of your readings, Lawrence of Arabia, the three Musketeers or Heathcliff.”Behind me the energy shifted, the heat rose, I became aware of his powerful presence surrounding me. I felt his breath on my bare nape and his arm tenderly coming closer to wrap around my waist. His lips brushed my neck and he whispered in my ear with this wonderful deep voice, melting me.“You are the only one who inspires me…”I had held my breath, and then exhaled a moan. I could feel his eagerness, his skin was burning warm, his body shuddering, his arousal evident. It was already difficult to stand and I knew I would let loose and fall under his spell. The warmth of his body and the temptation was unbearable and I felt myself become wet. He held me, imprisoned and safe in his arms gently running his lips on my neck and my shoulders. This soft touch gave me goose bumps. With his moves, he could make me do whatever he wished, whenever he wanted me.Tenderly his fingers strolled along on my hips, my waist and my belly. I stood motionless; eagerly awaiting what was to come. He slid his fingers under my cardigan inching it up, brushing my skin with the back of his hand. My knees slackened. He caught me and turned me toward him, pushing me against the bookshelf, déjà vu. His lips laid gentle kisses on mine, a silky swipe from the right corner of my mouth to the left. Comfortable, his long and soft fingers slid along my body, tugging at the lace of my bra, lingering on my nipples raised under the fabric. They kept moving languidly on my trembling belly. I was shaken by a gale force of desire. Watching the way his jaw tensed excited me even more, as if it were possible. His aqua eyes were intense, darker with desire. He opened his mouth to kiss my chin, biting gently, while he unbuttoned my jeans with his skilled hands. He swept two fingers under my panties and felt me waiting for him, hot, drenching and soaked. He smiled with satisfaction.“Yes Heaven, I know you want me.”I pursed my lips and stared at him, confirming my craving with a nod. His eyes consumed me. I never met anyone looking at me with so much lust and greed. I was his and he knew it. My hands roamed their own way finding his smooth chest, and his abs hard as a rock under his see-through shirt.Tom pulled his fingers from my panties and began to lick them with the tip of his tongue, eyes closed. His face glowed with pleasure, as if he was savoring the finest dish in the world. He seemed to be carried off into a world full of delight. He put his hands over my mouth sneaking his fingers slowly inside. The blend of my fluid with his was intoxicating. He nibbled my jaw, nudging against my ear lobe. My impatience became stronger and wilder; I felt my mind would drown in madness. I needed to have him in me right away. My hands moved with urgency to his pants, feeling his erection. But the bookshelf was not as solid as Max’s and it staggered under me.“Hush Hush, slow down…” he said, breaking away from me and holding me by the hand.I followed him into his bedroom. I had of course never seen it before, but only had eyes for the bed itself and only had thought for the feeling of his fingers interlaced into mine.Standing in front of me, he implored,“Anna-Lisa, please take off my clothes.”“As you want, Gorgeous… I know you love that!” I teased him with a wink.I immediately slipped my hands under his T-shirt, caressing his chest and shoulders. Every muscle contracted under this contact. I quickly got rid of any obstacle: his shirt, as his belt. I opened his pants and pulled them down together with his boxer briefs. My palms hurriedly ran along the length of his thighs and the swell of his buttocks and rushed to his hard cock, which already pointed at the ceiling. The tip of his penis was wet with anticipation.     “Steady, Anna-Lisa! We have all the time.” He smiled, pressing against me with his firm body, moving me toward the bed to force me to sit down.“Oh no, please!” I begged.He stood naked before me. I admired his perfectly sculpted silhouette and his smooth, almost hairless skin. His cock was spectacular and I wanted it, so much. He peered at me, his eyes darkening every second and every switch in my body turned on, cell-by-cell, starting with my burning and aching core.“Please, Heaven, undress yourself for me!”Without breaking visual contact with his divine body, I peeled off the rest of my clothes. Despite my desire, I did so gradually very leisurely. He wanted to go slow and he wanted to see.“Okay! Not as slowly as that…” he laughed and joined in my undressing, not letting any single piece of flesh go unexposed. I lay on the firm mattress, and he sat down at my feet. He bent to take one of my legs between his limber and nimble hands. His deep voice vibrated,“Teach me to sin” he whispered, and began leaving tender kisses along my calf, slowly working his way up to my knees, sometimes allowing the tip of his tongue to subtly taste my skin. His hands followed these kisses.“In love’s forbidden ways, for you can make all passion pure…”His bewitching voice kept on before his mouth found its place along my thighs. I moaned and gasped writhing with pleasure, closing my fists on the sheets.“The magic lure of your sweet eyes, each shape of sin makes virtue praise.”His tongue delved into my slit, on my clitoris followed by his fingers delicately pressing my needy entrance. I arched my back with lust to urge him on, but his fingers didn’t penetrate and I whined with frustration.“Teach me to sin.” He carried on kissing my belly and my navel, his fingertips slithering smoothly on my hips. One of my hands ran into his hair. I wanted to touch him so much.“Enslave me to your wanton charms, crush me in your velvet arms and make me, make me love you.”“Oh yes, love me, please!” I pleaded again.He gently moved his body to cover me with his weight. I spread my legs to let him settle. His hands had taken the lead on his kisses that now lingered on my ribs and between my breasts. His fingers eagerly caressed my chest.“Make me fire your blood with new desire, and make me kiss you—lip and limb till senses reel and pulses swim.”He paused to capture my nipple in his mouth, nibbling and sucking, as he knew I adored. My whole body shook. If he kept on like that I would come even before he took me. Yet my nails were digging into his shoulder blades. I tipped my head back and my moans turned into little whimpers of pain, such in need of him.“Aye! even if you hate me…”He slid one hand along my waist and the other along my neck, squeezing lightly, kissing my shoulders and the base of my nape, and biting my earlobe. The he said a last time,“Teach me to sin.”“Oh my God!” I breathed.“No, that’s from Alfred Bryan!” He said, joyfully gazing into my eyes and thrusting his cock into me, at last.“Oh no, this is you! … Oh yes … you in me … finally…” I wailed, my legs squeezing around him.He rolled his hips back and forth, languorously and skillfully. Each movement was intense and deep. His length rubbed smoothly inside me awakening delirious and frenzied sensations. Our lips joined and our tongues entwined. I moaned and implored. He looked me in the eyes and I immersed myself into his, sinking slowly to the well of his soul. I sensed a connection between us. Into his eyes and into his arms I felt protected like never before. We were making love! And I felt I could gently submerge with him into pleasure, into bliss and into his love. My hips marked their pace on his infinite, long and slow movements. I stroked his butt to pull him even closer. It felt as if our emotions were in the air around us. They poured on me, into me. My orgasm came endlessly, voluptuously. I burst onto Tom, hoping the feeling would last forever. My body tensed and jolted with pleasure. Our gazes still connected, I begged Tom not to stop, to love me again and again.His jaw contracted forward and I recognized the signs of his own release. He stiffened three times, jerking in me and groaning deep. Tears came to my eyes. He caressed my cheek. Running his hands behind my neck and down my back, he cuddled me to him, laying tender and almost imperceptible kisses on my lips. He remained still within me. I began to cry. He licked the teardrops that rolled on my temples and kissed my eyelids. He knew how to comfort me.“Tom, you don’t need me to teach you how to sin…” I whispered holding him in my arms. 



A Creative Duet
Chapter Summary
Anna-Lisa and Tom begin to create. It is not that simple, but pleasant enough anyway.
Chapter Notes
WARNINGS/TRIGGERS/AUTHOR NOTES: Straight unprotected sex and a bit of messy paintingNOTES / AVERTISSEMENTS : Let’s begin directly with a bit of sex for a change. Tenderness and complicity are for later. This is a very short chapter for once. As usual, thank you to my beta-reader @ quoting-shakespeare-to-ducks. Copyright - 00062229-1



Every day I found a different angle about him, and every day he was more handsome. At this moment glasses filtered his gaze, but that didn’t make him appear less intense—quite the opposite. His icy blue eyes were even more piercing when framed. I felt like a schoolgirl in a crowded classroom fantasizing about her teacher. I refused to picture his students at Columbia queuing outside the door of his office for a private meeting. For now, I had his full attention. It was just mine. It was our time together, only for the two of us. We would finally combine our aesthetical universes and create. The painter, the artist stood before me. At least, it was the case less than a minute ago, because now he was a predator whose greedy eyes were emphasized by delicate gray frames.I sat on my worktable wrapped in his blue shirt. He settled up between my legs, wearing only jeans. His body instinctively found its place. How could we have thought it a good idea to work so close to each other with so little clothes on?Since the previous day, his easel and paint cans occupied part of my studio. He had just dropped his belongings here and this seemed natural to me, despite my solitary habits. His scent had already become part of the room. My sheets were filled with him, and his shirt left his fragrance on me like a second skin.And at this moment we had no intention to create art. With him, I had allowed myself to be free and wild, to be this adventurous and hungry woman, a woman so far from my usual self and who was now so familiar. I loved to be that woman with him. I crossed my legs around his waist to pull him closer to me. I brushed his bare stomach with the tip of my fingers, causing him to shiver. It was a game I enjoyed, to feel his muscles contract one by one under my touch. I kissed his chest slowly, his suprasternal notch and neck. I was going at that vein—my favorite—the one claimed for mine after many hugs and nibbling. His skin was so smooth and it tasted of cinnamon. Under my lips I felt his heartbeat pulsing blood in his carotid. I gradually owned this man like a vampire thirsty for his body. His breath quickened and his fingers ran under my shirt. I unbuttoned his jeans and slipped my hand inside. His cock responded immediately, he was hardening as I was stroking. Tom moaned in my ear. Under my touch, his was mine.He held my head in both of his hands and swung it back, kissed the base of my neck as if to mark his prey then moved up hungrily onto my lips. I continued to stroke and pull on his hardened cock. We needed to own each other, give ourselves to each other.My fingers found their way to his butt, pulling at his jeans to free his shaft. He clutched my shirt—well, actually the collar of his own shirt—and tore the buttons from the fabric, scattering them around the room. We were naked in each other arms, our hands hurried and greedy, and our kisses voracious and deep. Our constant and familiar craving was still there, always as powerful.On the table next to me he had arrayed tins of acrylic paint in blue, gray and white: his colors. As I held him against me, kissing his shoulder, my hands fondling his back, he opened a lid and dipped his fingers in the liquid paint.“Tom, what are you thinking of?”“You’ve inspired me once more, so I’m planning to improvise.” He laughed mischievously.“Gorgeous, you’re going to make me crazy!”Holding on to me, he applied several layers of paint in different colors on my back and my bottom, a wet and cold caress. His fingers tickled and I giggled.“Body painting again?”“Sort of, but I rather think of it as sex painting.” He whispered, covering me as I lay on the table.When he used that low and sexy voice, I knew he’d do what he wanted with me. The tip of his penis pressed on my clitoris, seeking its way, but foreplay was unnecessary. I was ready for him, already so wet. He grabbed my hips with both hands and held me firm then pushed right into me. His grip pulled me to him with every thrust; each jolt driving me to insatiable need. Strangely, I’d become like a huge brush, painting on the wooden worktop. The blue acrylic mixed with the scraps of dried plaster and clay on the surface. I arched my back and brought my hips closer to him in rhythm. The contact made an intoxicating sound that triggered even more excitement in me. I groaned with lust, heading rapidly towards my orgasm. My body slipped and slid between his grasp and the table.Continuing to sink into me, he bit one breast then kissed it passionately. His weight shifted me. He used me to create his own masterpiece, and that idea was driving me out of mind with immeasurable lust. I needed to stick to reality; I didn’t want to sink yet. I needed to find a steady point somewhere. I pulled on his hair; I reached for a paint jar behind me, but only managed to overturn it. Red pigment ran down my arm and mixed in bright spots of colors with this new art piece we created.“Oh Heaven!” he growled, staring at me.I sensed his pleasure, his muscles tensed, his jaw contracted in his sexy way and his eyes livened by a wild fire. It was impossible to tell which of us came first. That moment was so intense, so hot that only my body was able to store any information. My inner walls tightened strongly around his cock and a feeling of bliss overtook my entire being. I convulsed round him as he filled me with his essence.Then everything went quiet. Again, I found myself sitting on the table wrapped in his arms, panting. But now paint was everywhere, including in locations which I didn’t know existed. He was covered in blue as well, even into his hair. Our hands had to pursue their own paths, uncontrollable.He caught his breath and rested his chin on my shoulder while he looked at the table behind me:“Interesting work, isn’t it?”I came down from the worktop to admire our masterpiece while his arms still wreathed around me lovingly. I contemplated our art protected against his muscular chest. It was not without contrast. The cracked clay was revealed under shades of gray and cobalt. Red dots made the whole composition vibrate with intensity. This creation illustrated us, without a doubt.“The concept is more than enjoyable, so it is very compelling. But we may find it difficult to exhibit.”***Hot water trickled slowly over our bodies. Paint dissolved under the pleasant flow. The tiled floor of the shower took on azure colors, a tinted tide. The summer day had been rather soggy, yet some low sunlight still found its way into the studio. While raindrops sprinkled New York another fine, warm drizzle comforted us. Nina Simone’s voice soothed us from the old record player, a deserved relaxation after our ardent and sexually creative moment. But the task that Max had given us hadn’t even started yet.Between our fingers lathered a fresh and subtle scent of English gardenias. We took our time to meticulously erase the traces of paint on our skin. These were evidence of an unsuccessful attempt. I gently stroked his shoulders with my fingertips to remove the dried blue stains. Our movements were sweet and tender. Simply being in his arms was so nice and natural. I was relaxed and nothing existed except this moment of complicity.“It’s harder than I thought to create with you,” he said, running a hand full of soap over my neck.Although this gesture would normally make me his submissive prey, right now I had a different desire. His touch was so delicate at that instant. I longed to stay in this protective bubble with him. At last, I finally felt free to talk to him:“Believe me, Tom. I am trying. I want to share my art with you. But I don’t know how. You can’t imagine how much I want you in my world.” I confessed.I rested my head on his shoulder, rubbing his chest and lightly running my fingers between the few hairs he had there. I needed to make him understand that I was sincere and how much he really meant to me.“I know,” he said, his hands winding up in my hair. He kissed my forehead and went on, “But as you say, the idea we had isn’t usable.” He joked.He massaged my head softly to wash the paint from my short ginger hair. I melted under his touch. I quietly brushed a finger to his temple to smudge the blue marks around his eyes. His little wrinkles were my weakest point, as if I only had one.“I’m convinced we can manage to collaborate. But it might be better if we keep a certain distance.” I said.“Of course, but not now.” He smiled as he closed his hands around my waist to envelop me.“Yes, we will try tomorrow.” I sighed.“You’re talking about creating together, I hope?” He scanned me anxiously.I laughed. “Pervert! Yes, tomorrow we will try to create again, for real. But we will find another angle, less, well more…”“Yes, tomorrow. But right now this warm water gives a lot of ideas to this pervert, your pervert…” he teased.“Since my gorgeous pervert is never tired, my body will eventually break. You’re a real demon!”“Heaven, the devil always plays the best tunes…”“Maybe, but I still have tons of paint everywhere.” I pretended to complain while soaping his butt generously.“Goddamn! Who’s the evil one now?”



Private vs. Public
Chapter Summary
Anna-Lisa and Tom are reunited their studio. Daily routines set in and creativity goes away ... how can she get it back? With a visit to the MoMa, perhaps?
Chapter Notes

His kicked-off running shoes noisily bounced off the floor and he uttered a few words of apology; he didn’t want to wake me. However I had already opened my eyes when he came through the door a few minutes ago. Unconsciously, I had been waiting for him. He had returned from his morning run in Central Park. He had to ascend nearly the whole of 9th Avenue to go running every day.I stretched lazily out the curled up into a ball in the sheets to relish the sight of him undressing to take a shower. He was drenched in sweat. Sport had carved his physique into that of a Greek god. His torso wasn’t really broad, but each muscle was perfectly chiseled. His legs were long and his thighs firm. His athletic frame moved with a graceful and captivating elegance. The open plan of my studio allowed me to lie in bed and watch him shower. Hot water streamed down his skin and I stared as his hands slid over his body. He sang, “My Funny Valentine”; he had learned that it was my favorite song. So, he knew I was awake and knew I couldn’t resist for long. I would end up joining him under the shower, like every morning.For a week, we had the same daily ritual. After his run, I would crush myself against him in the shower and we’d make love. Sometimes we did it in the bed, again. Then, we made breakfast together. Our eating habits were quite different, and we’d divide up our cooking tasks. I made coffee with my capsule machine, which was not a big effort. I added a spoon of sugar and lots of milk for him—a sweet little detail quickly learned and memorized—and drank my espresso black. After all, he was the gentle one and I was the wildest. However, sometimes, these roles would swiftly reverse.Coffee ready, I had plenty of time to watch the chef at work. Even food was a matter of perfection for him. Dressed only in sweatpants, he was a thousand times sexier than Chef Ramsay. He broke two eggs into a bowl and whipped them with a smooth and nimble wrist. His biceps contracted subtly. Once in a while I’d tease him, saying there was nothing more exciting than a man in a kitchen, and that a woman should never admit she can cook. I still hadn’t shown him what I could do in the kitchen. Instead, I just burnt everything I prepared. He swore to me that if I roasted a steak that no one else could chew, he would eat anyway.I usually ate slices of tomato with brie for breakfast. Amused, he said that he’d never seen an American who liked “stinky” cheese so much. I bought tons of it every week at a French grocery. It was a staple food, an expensive luxury. Tom now regularly took some for his scrambled eggs.So, according to routine, we’d eat breakfast and plan our day. Twice a week, he taught at Columbia. When he could break away, we’d meet for a picnic in Washington Square or for a simple salad in a local organic restaurant. We’d return to the studio later in the day to work on our art.While he painted, I would sometimes ride to the bakery to get cheesecake for his 5 o’clock tea. I loved watching him eat cake; he was like a greedy child in his delight. But more often I just went back to bed, or sat in front of the TV, or dug my nose in one of his books. Lately I couldn’t concentrate on my sculptures and create, whether alone or with him. No concrete idea had grown in my head for days. We thought working side by side on our own projects would relax and inspire us. Yet, for me, nothing!I watched Tom worked in his white T-shirt and jeans smeared with paint stains. His gestures were fluid, painting the canvas carefully and majestically. His whole face was absorbed in his task. A wrinkle of concentration formed above his nose. Obviously, the distraction of his handsome self was making it difficult for me to work.I felt such huge frustration. Confronted by the intensity of his art, I wished to build an object of lightness and absolute purity: a sculpture that would highlight every movement, each of the nuances of blue, before bringing them to life. I researched for days to get the perfect hue and consistency for my mixture. It grew into an obsession. The blend was never light enough. I’d look at Tom and my work seemed dull in comparison. The clay was never smooth or malleable enough. I remembered our caresses; his skin on mine, and the mix became rough under my fingertips. I had preserved the memory of our creative sexual intercourse in shades of blue punctuated by purple and vermillion notes—that memory emblazoned on the wooden plank of my desk. Consequently, I had spent hours with my fingers in different combinations of clay and plaster trying to capture that memory. But I was unable to get anything. Nothing was as wonderful as being with him, snuggled onto his chest.Now and then I blamed him for taking up so much space, for reducing me to an artist cut off from her gifts. I blamed him for ignoring my despair while he freely created on his canvases in this atelier. I looked at his paintings slowly emerging and realized I was falling in love with this man and his genius.I sighed, my hands caught in a gaping shapeless mass, and I received his attention.“Is there something wrong, Heaven?” he asked.“I think I’m stuck. I can’t get anywhere today. I lack inspiration.” I answered with a deceptively light tone. I didn’t want him to notice my dismay. I couldn’t hurt or worry him, an old habit from my childhood—don’t bother anyone.“We could take a break and go out. How about a walk?” he suggested.“Good idea. We should see an expo. There is an Andreas Gursky retrospective at the MoMa. It’s closing tomorrow, making space for another one: mine.”“You’re exhibiting at the MoMa and you didn’t tell me?”“I forgot. I didn’t have to prepare new work for it, so it’s not that important.” I said.“Anna-Lisa, showing at the MoMa is a great honor!” He exclaimed.“Maybe it is. In the meanwhile I think I need an ice cream at Central Park.” I smiled.“You know you can get anything from me with sweets.” He joked. “By the way, I’m proud of you.”I pulled on a light pearl-gray silk dress that enhanced my silhouette. It featured a bare back which highlighted my neck and short haircut. Looking in the mirror, I could see the color intensified my eyes and the silk spun on my milky complexion like a cloud. Now I didn’t feel sad anymore. I felt beautiful. Thanks to Tom, I was more feminine and stronger than ever but also, so fragile. Tom put on a sky-blue linen shirt and dark-gray shorts. We turned our backs to each other while dressing. We knew if we looked at each other, we wouldn’t get out the door.The streets of New York were sultry like every summer afternoon. We strolled together hand in hand to the subway, for a little underground coolness.The museum wasn’t very crowded and the air conditioning was very welcome. The few tourists gathered mainly on the Pollock and Warhol floors. So, the top floor reserved for the Gursky exhibition was nearly deserted. Only some adventurous survivors from the storey below were loitering there. Andreas Gursky was a wise choice, he would give no ego complex to the artists we were, as he was a photographer—a giant, even if sometimes controversial. He had the capacity to play with his photographs and show the world larger, stranger and more remarkable. They were magical and almost surreal. The sensation was familiar to me as lately I had the feeling of being in a parallel universe, living at full speed, suspended in time. I took everything that Tom gave me with an immeasurable ecstasy. And I paid him back with all I had, even though I was afraid to lose myself and my ability to create.An imaginative perspective of Ha Long Bay with hundreds of islands on a calm and shimmering sea greeted visitors and pulled them into a virtual world. Tom smiled with his usual enthusiastic childish grin, which lit his face up to his eyes. It was the same fervor he had for the Banksy graffiti on our first date. I never had so much fun at discovering art with someone. Even Max, and his adoration of artists, didn’t reach this level. This ardor, I had no problem sharing it.At one point he just stood for long minutes in front of a photograph, trying to understand how the artist might have done it. His wonder was plainly written on his face. I let him stay lost in thought and moved toward the next picture. After, without a word, he caught up to me. In my turn, I was absorbed by an impossible vision of a hotel hallway. He walked behind me and touched my hand. He lingered on the fabric of my dress, gently stroking.At the next image we stood together, my shoulder imperceptibly leaned onto his arm. I was speechless, not looking at him. He pretended to ignore me. Some guests were escorted around the exposition and they ignored us, too. His fingers sought mine and they discreetly entwined. Together, we walked toward the next room, where a new row of photos portraying working people was displayed. A cloud of still and silent people, immortalized, inhabited the space. We were the only ones of flesh and bone. Tom tipped his palm on my neck and let it linger while staring at one of the photos. Two fingers strolled down my bare back. This touch gave me chills. Before he could reach the gray silk, I walked away from him slowly. I could feel his eyes on me and I moved at leisure. I knew very well the game we were playing. Photography was no longer our interest.In front of another snapshot, he stopped behind me and carelessly let his fingers scuffle between the bottom of my shift and my thigh. He whispered in my ear a series of words that sounded more like an order than a question.“Anna-Lisa, would you be ready to follow me anywhere?”I sketched my answer with a little nod. Of course, I would follow him anywhere. My thoughts hadn’t been coherent for quite some time. I felt a desire that was completely my master. Maybe it was this—what we called passion—and in this case I was going to get lost.So, I led him and he stalked me into another area, filled with oversized images of new buildings with a multitude of plans and details. These visions gave me a feeling of vertigo. Somehow, we were on the top of these skyscrapers ready to tumble.Tom moved in behind me once more, so close I could feel his breath on my nape. A finger was traveled along my arm. It was delectable. But we were not alone. He turned back to the other end of the room faking to admire other artworks, all the time watching for intruders and keeping an eye on me. I busied myself pretending to contemplate the rest of the exhibition. I turned to see him looking at me with a confident face, his figure so sumptuous and manly. I vaguely glanced at the pictures, prolonging the perception of his gaze on me. When other visitors left the area, we were standing together again. This time, he caught me and carefully grabbed both my wrists. He brushed my mouth with his lips. I felt his soft breath on my skin. This lasted only a few seconds, because the security cameras were working. Holding my hand, he led me to the next room. A small dark corridor served as a transition hall. An illuminated signal pointed to the emergency exit, behind a black curtain that divided the space.Checking that nobody saw us, Tom rushed us behind the drape and slammed me to the wall, kissing me voraciously. A fine beam of light penetrated between the wall and the curtain, and lit us up. We heard someone walk through the hallway. Without any noise, we paused and watched the stranger go on their way. They didn’t hear us.Despite the danger, I couldn’t control my hands. They unbuttoned his shirt, moved to his back, and held him close to me with all their strength. His kisses continued compelling and increasingly needy. He lowered one of the straps of my dress to clear my shoulders. With more urgent and greedy kisses he devoured my body and my will. His tongue on my skin was a caress that I never wanted to stop. He licked and nibbled my nape, my neck and steered toward my breast revealed under the dim light of the museum.Again, in his hands, I was alive. My body vibrated and breathed. I needed him. I craved him. I wanted to drown in his fragrance filling my lungs. I was going to fill myself with the intoxicating taste of his skin. Soon, the warmth of his body compressed against mine would invade me. I lusted for Tom, my painter, my man. I had to feel his cock inside me. At that instant, he unbuttoned his fly and dropped his pants to penetrate me. I let him take me, in this public place. I wanted him to fuck me passionately, here, standing against the wall.His deep kisses prevented me crying out. He ate up the least of my reactions, concentrating so much the wrinkle between his brows was plainly visible. I felt his stiff cock inside my body rubbing my most sensitive spot. His hands cupped around my breasts and squeezed them hard with the depth of his desire. I knew I was about to come and then my pleasure threw me into an uncontrollable state, my body shook and exploded around him, in his arms. He led me away in this indecent erotic moment. In spite of the threat of being discovered, I let him possess me and propel me toward the orgasm I needed.All at once, he tightened, his body hard as a rock against mine, powerful and indomitable. Three or four more vigorous strokes in me and he reached his own shuddering climax. He planted his mouth on my bare shoulder and held it there, silently biting me, leaving yet another love mark. Since he was in my life, I was finally able to feel my whole body. I was aware of any sensation in every of my cells. Yet, this body wasn’t mine anymore, from now on it belonged to him, imprinted by his desire.



Comfort
Chapter Summary
Even though Anna-Lisa feels beautiful and feminine, having a woman’s body is difficult at times. Sex can bring up questions and wake up old memories, even with an understanding and tender man. Between desire, pleasure, loving her man and fear, she knows only confusion and contradiction.
Chapter Notes
WARNINGS/TRIGGERS/AUTHOR NOTES: Oral sex, menstruationNOTES / ADVERTISEMENTS: I tried to speak of typically female issues. I hope I am not shocking, because it's obviously not romantic at all!Thanks to my beta-reader @quoting-shakespeare-to-ducks.Copyright - 00062229-1



Lately I’ve been living with my head in the clouds. I wasn’t alone in my loft and I wasn’t alone in the world anymore. Tom occupied all of my thoughts. His woodsy-lime fragrance filed the room, even in his absence. His toiletries had invaded my bathroom. His paintings had taken over the space. He simply took up the whole studio. Sometimes the fluffy clouds I lived in turned into a heavy fog stifling my creativity; I felt like I was sinking, not floating.But even so, his presence soothed and comforted me. He radiated joy from his whole being and I felt safe. Most of the time, I felt free and could finally let go and live. I coiled into his arms, and I breathed a little. Every day was magical and full of surprises. I had no idea of what he would do and where he would lead me. This was exciting and frightening at the same time. He only saw me. He only wanted me. His eyes and his smile gave me wings and I felt light.Not to mention our intense and insane sexual chemistry! He made me feel everything, at last. I was feminine and desirable, a real woman. “I’m a woman; I can make love to a crocodile.” I finally understood Koko Taylor’s song and the theurgy of being a woman, the magic of making love. All this was because of Tom, his body and his mind.Today, though, my female body had overwhelmed me. Those pesky hormones called out my name again. I didn’t like them at all and this was mutual. Usually I felt them coming, and I sank into melancholy for several days. But since I had become someone else’s paradise, I missed them showing up from my lofty height. So here I was, lying down again. I had curled myself up into my bed, dying of heat and pain. The summer’s humidity stuck to my skin. My shirt and my panties were wet and uncomfortable. My energy was gone and I was good-for-nothing. The cramps were terrible and the flow was heavy. Its pungent mineral smell made me nauseous. Why did there had to be apples and snakes in the Garden of Eden?By early afternoon, my man discovered me in this position when he came home from work. I heard him singing in the elevator and recognized his confident and cheerful footstep when he entered the studio. He expected to find me ready to work and happy to see him. Instead, I was livid and motionless on the mattress.I wanted to explain it to him. I wanted him to understand, “Darling, you will have to do without, for a while,” while also telling him, “welcome to the part of my private world that shoots me down for two days each month, and which no one wishes to hear about.” Not really glamorous! So I stayed silent.He ditched his back bag on the floor and lied down on his stomach next to me, his chin in his hands nestled close to my face.“Anna-Lisa, is there anything wrong? You are so pale, do you feel ghastly?” he asked, his eyes betraying his anxiety.“No, it’s nothing. I just have my period.” I finally dropped the word as naturally as possible.“Oh I understand! My older sister used to have a really difficult time with it. Can I do something for you? Do you want tea or a cool drink? I could bring you a hot-water bottle for the cramps, if you want.” He gently brushed my forehead with his fingertips.“No, thank you, you’re so adorable. No hot-water bottle, I am way too hot.”He placed a kiss on my head before getting up. I saw him heading to the kitchen to take two cans of fresh Diet Coke from the fridge, and then he turned into the bathroom, where he moistened a towel under cold water. He pulled off his jeans to be more comfortable and moved back to bed, wearing only gray boxer-shorts, a white shirt and a smile. He handed me a cold Coke, telling me he hoped it would help. I drank a sip while he turned on the record player and put on the latest Bon Iver album. He set his drink on the floor and lied down behind me. With the cool, damp cloth, he refreshed my shoulders, my neck and my face, wiping sweat away from my forehead. I let him take care of me, so simply. This was exactly what I needed.Tom snuggled close to me, spooning me, and laid his hands on my lower belly so his heat can relax me where I hurt the most. He kissed my nape with a series of devoted kisses, and whispered:“Heaven, sleep tight. I am watching over you.”I felt the warmth of his body on my back and the tenderness of his arms. I closed my eyes and tears began to flow. I couldn’t hold them back. I clung to his strong arms. My breathing became difficult. He sensed the change in me. Even though I tried to hide it from him, he saw me crying. He didn’t ask for any explanation and hugged me tighter, his face buried into my red hair. He allowed me to let go, whispering a comforting “hush” into my ear.I had had so much pain years ago, after my bone-marrow procedure, but nobody ever took care of my body like this. My heart broke after my brother died, but no one let me cry or comforted me this way. And this day, I suffered even more. The agony I felt was partly sorrow for what I didn’t have before. Now, I was a gloomy little girl and a woman in the arms of a man who was taking care of me so naturally. My mind wandered somewhere between the abandoned child and the female capable of seducing an alligator. I lost my balance. I let my tears flew for a while and fell asleep while he rocked me.The sun was already quite low when I woke. The shadows from the buildings had cooled the streets down. Tom was still wrapped around me. The record had long since stopped playing. The only sound was Tom snoring at my neck. I gently extricated myself from his arms without waking him. He turned on his back, and his breathing quieted. I was feeling a little better, but still out of shape. I rushed to wash and changed, and the snoring resumed. This was the first time I noticed it and I wanted to giggle. Tom’s snoring was a rather charming hum between the purr of a big tomcat and the roar of a lazy tiger.Right now, he was really beautiful with his hands above his head, asleep like a baby. His white shirt had lifted slightly, giving me a peek at his navel and the V-muscles that traced an explicit path downward.How could I think about sex when my body was stunned and my numb muscles ached? In spite of it, I wanted him; I wanted to give him pleasure. Not to thank him, but just because of the man he was. He was everything I ever dreamed, strong and sweet at once. Might and confidence emanated from him. This made him adventurous and fearless. He knew how to soothe and secure me while driving me to the edge, disinhibiting me. He set me off laughing and his optimism was contagious. His intelligence and creativity stimulated me. But he also owned a kindness and an inner fragility—something that touched me and that I had the longing to understand, although I didn’t get where it came from. He was at ease with his speaking manner and it gave him assurance. But I understood that he was somehow hiding behind it, because in reality he didn’t say much about himself. It was a form of timidity and a natural discretion.On the other hand, we had learned how to exchange. Our tennis matches were fair games. He was good at giving or taking, and so was I. Right now, I wanted to give, to demonstrate my love in the way he had taught me. This assertive behavior was far from the person I used to be, but belonged to the strong woman who sometimes took over.I knelt on the mattress, at the foot of the bed. Lowering, I moved like a silent she-wolf between his legs. I wanted to wake him up gently. His muscles were so finely drawn and attractive, revealed by his open shirt. My fingers were drawn like magnets to him, and I had to hold them back. I brushed his skin, caressing the wispy hairs below his navel, which ended hiding under his boxer-shorts. I could feel his skin shivered in response, but he was still asleep. I placed a kiss from the tip of my lip, softly, just below his navel, taking the time to let his fragrance filled me—his woodsy and spicy scent, so luscious and intoxicating, that calmed me and excited me all at once. My tongue relished his skin deliciously as my hands fondled under his shirt. I heard him moaned in rapture and breathed between his teeth:“Heaven…”I applied a shower of kisses along his belly muscles, these V-muscles, licking and devouring the soft and supple flesh, heading even lower. My fingers strolled down over his hips toward the elastic of his pants. I removed them leisurely, sliding them down his butt, to reveal his beautiful, stiffening cock. I took his shaft with the palm of my hand. It looked like a cute little animal that needed attention, but certainly not for long.Tom lifted on his elbows and gazed at me in anticipation, eyes darkened with lust. His breathing was already halting with excitement. I stripped off my t-shirt so he could admire my naked and firm breasts, heavy from lust. I lowered my arms down, slowly trailing a finger along my curves. I leaned lazily, squeezing my elbows together to push up my cleavage. I stared at him with a fierce look and a devilish grin. He knew now that I intended to fall on him like a ravenous creature.My mouth finally leveled up to his thighs, and I tenderly kissed his inner legs. His skin was so delicate there. I grasped his penis and licked my lips. I used his glans on my wet lips like a lipstick. His breath stopped for a moment. I kept teasing him slowly, staring at him with piercing eyes, longing. The heat in my cores increased despite my periodic discomfort.I parted my lips to let his cock into my mouth. My tongue began a dance, circling the tip of his penis. I slowly straightened the rest of his length between my fingers. I tightened my grip, stroking him up and down. He growled and tilted his head back. I whimpered in response. I sensed his body tensed up, and could feel his pleasure growing. The sensation of his member hardening in the warmth of my mouth was divine.When I broke off to reposition myself, he instantly stared at me begging me to continue. I sent him an expert wink, and sunk my tongue to the base of his cock just above his testicles. I moved up gradually, mouthing his hot length with tiny delicate sucks. One hand caressed his balls, and the other sought his butt. He whined, imploring:“Oh… Heaven … please … yes…”He was under my spell.“Yes, Gorgeous, I know … it’s so good,” I moaned and groaned again, ravaging, enjoying the moment as much as him.Again, I found the tip of his cock with my mouth. I slightly pressed my tongue on the head of it, and with a finger gently massaged the frenulum. I was not sure how I knew to do this, but it had the desired effect. He was surprised by this unfamiliar treat and his muscles stiffened under his increasing pleasure. He gasped, and his hands frantically entangled in my hair. He stared at me through his thick eyelashes, eyelids half-closed, as I took his member fully in.Caressing one testicle between nimble fingers, I then sank his cock deeper into my mouth. My other hand surrounded his base, holding tight. I stirred the length of him back and forth, using my lips to protect it from my teeth. I increased the pressure and the pace of my motions grew faster and faster. I alternated this with vibrating my tongue under the skin of his glans. I couldn’t stop myself from moaning. I loved the fullness of his cock in my mouth, and couldn’t wait to taste his cum.He couldn’t hold back any longer. I raised my eyes to watch as he violently propelled to his orgasm. His legs stretched around me, his abs taut and strained. I saw his jaw clenched while he swung his head back. His fists clenched at the sheets. He shouted with pleasure as his semen poured down my throat.“Anna-Lisa…”He had completely abandoned himself. He let me lead him to the brink of pleasure, and then pushed him over. He trusted me without question. I had given this man everything I could. I had attended to his cravings, and seeing him capsized under gave me a sense of absolute power. He was now utterly mine.His face still flushed with satisfaction, Tom gazed at me in ecstasy. I returned his gaze with a knowing smile. I placed adoring kisses on his belly and chest. Then, I curled up in his arms, my head in the crook of his shoulder. His fingertips drew tiny circles on my wrist.“I may have to return that favor.” he said, his voice still wandering in his bliss.“Not right away, Gorgeous. Wait for a few days, and then I’ll feel better.”“I’m sorry that you feel so poorly. I wish I could help you. They do say that sex can be a relief.” he declared, far from innocently.“Unfortunately, this expression is a myth in my case. However, I wouldn’t refuse a massage on my lower back. Cramps twinge me just on the kidneys.”Tom rubbed his hands against each other to warm them up and placed his palm on my lumbar and pleasantly began pressing, alternating pressure with his fingers.“I guess you didn’t do that to your sisters?”He laughed: “Ehehehe… No! But I had muscle soreness during rugby and I know that heat and pressure can help. Am I hurting you?” he asked, concerned, while removing a lock of hair from my face.“No, it’s perfect. You’re perfect, Tom!” I sighed. I hugged him, kissing the base of his neck. He tightened his hold around me without saying a word. After a while he asked:“This afternoon, your tears weren’t only because of pain, were they? You know you can confide in me.”“Maybe… But I don’t feel like talking about it now.” I replied shyly with a lump in my throat. I didn’t have the strength to burst back into tears. I just wanted to relax and enjoy resting on his shoulder.“As you wish. I’m not going anywhere, so I’ll be here for you when you feel the need to talk.” he finally said.We lingered in silence, entwined for a long moment before he continued on:“I’m sorry, but I must confess that I’m relieved that you are on your period. All this time, I’ve been stupid enough not to ask you about contraception, and I haven’t used any protection.”My body jerked suddenly and I turned on my back, avoiding his gaze as he went on:“I’m sorry; did I say something I shouldn’t? I know this isn’t very subtle and I don’t want to hurt you. I have had STD testing, some time ago and I’m clean, you can trust that.”I sat in bed, arms around my knees and my head in my arms, before answering curtly and anxiously.“I am on the Pill. But we didn’t protect ourselves. How could I forget such a basic thing? I haven’t protected you from me.”“Why, you were never tested?” he asked, running his hand on my shoulder.“No, never, not since my childhood.” I said.“Did your previous partners use condoms?”“Yes, always … except you. How could I have been so dumb?”I began to panic. My breath quickened. I brushed his hand off my shoulder.“So, we’re not at risk, then!” he replied, trying to cheer me up.But his efforts were all in vain. I remained prostrated, refusing any of his attempts to approach. Helpless to comfort me, he jumped up out of bed and grabbed his phone. He drummed his fingers on the screen for a few moments, and then instructed me in a quiet voice:“Anna-Lisa, please get dressed. I found a testing center that is open at this hour. We are going together now!”I raised incredulous eyes at him.“Let me prove to you that we aren’t at risk. We are going right now!” he repeated, decisively.So, I put on jeans and a t-shirt. I swallowed a painkiller and I followed him without a word. I was unable to meet his gaze. I kept at a distance, but I sensed his tender eyes on me. He walked slowly beside me, guiding me without upsetting me or talking to me.The sun had set. There weren’t many people in the streets. Neon signs lit our path. Some people were still hanging out in grocery stores, and restaurants entertained small crowds. He hailed a taxi. As Tom opened the door for me, I slid into the back seat and leaned my head on the window. He sat beside me without touching me. All the way, he looked worriedly at me, but stayed silent.We arrived a few minutes later outside of the health clinic. Tom paid the taxi driver and got out of the car. He offered his hand to help me out. I seized it without thinking.“Everything will be fine.” he said in a calm, hushed voice.I was totally frozen by my feelings, unable to think. I was scared, fear paralyzed me. I had the sensation of losing everything; I might be suddenly alone in the world. I was hurt and I felt guilty. Tom stood right next to me, his presence almost unbearable. Yet, I didn’t want him to leave. I felt I was going to fall apart.We entered the clinic. Tom helped me sit in the waiting room and then he walked to the counter to ask for the tests. The place reeked of disinfectant and detergent. It smelt like a hospital. And here I was, feeling like an incompetent adult that couldn’t think straight, suddenly plunged back into a childhood world of white coats, syringes and death. I watched him standing next to the office and I began to hate him. I despised him for bringing me here, for putting me in this position. But most of all, I cursed myself. I was toxic. I could have killed this man. I could kill the people I loved and just be alone forever. I was going to follow through and prove to him that I was venomous.A nurse came to get me and I followed suit, Tom behind me, down a cold hallway lit with too-bright fluorescent lights. She invited us to take our place in a narrow room in front of a small white table. Glove boxes, syringes and bandages were neatly arranged on shelves. My man put his hand on my shoulder before placing it on the table. My gaze was lost in the void, and my whole body was taut. I answered the nurse’s questions mechanically. I had no more leverage to fight.She warned us that, as we were doing this test together, we shouldn’t conceal anything. Tom replied that he had nothing to hide and I just muttered an “OK” without conviction. After the usual questions about our risk behaviors, possible drug use, the number of unprotected sexual relations and the number of our partners, the nurse said that we were very likely safe from infection.Tom grabbed my hand with a smile but I flinched. I hadn’t quite yet incorporated this news. The nurse understood the situation and moved my head to keep eye contact with me.“Miss, you never had unprotected sex with any man other than your partner here, correct?”I confirmed with a nod. She continued:“You’ve never taken drugs, and from your bone-marrow surgery, your tests were negative. Also, your boyfriend was tested three months after his separation from his ex-girlfriend and has since consistently used condoms. In that case, I can tell you that you have near-zero HIV risk. But to reassure you, we will complete a quick test, anyway.”“Excellent idea!” said Tom, already holding out his hand to the nurse in order to puncture his fingertip. After she disinfected him and stung his forefinger with a lancet, she collected a drop of blood on a strip and placed it in a labeled tube. Tom stroked my back fondly and I let him do so, but I remained motionless. He motioned to me that it was my turn.“Tom… I’m afraid of needles.” I confessed, embarrassed.He gently held my cheek with one hand and moved me to look at him.“Heaven, I’m here. Just keep looking at my eyes.”So, I laid my hand on the table and I felt the nurse untangling my fingers. I stared into his icy blue eyes and immersed myself in them. All of a sudden, he winked mischievously and produced an adorable smile. The corners of my lips lifted in turn. He had found the breach in the walls of my heart, again.The nurse informed us she would return in five minutes. Finally, I let myself go in my man’s arms. I collapsed absolutely exhausted.Soon enough, the nurse returned and announced that all the tests were negative!“Heaven, it’s over! There’s no more danger.”“Gorgeous, I could have killed you and lost you.” I said.“Anna-Lisa, now that I’ve found you, I will never go away.” he stated simply, a smile lighting his beautiful face.



Please, Professor

The subway was almost empty at this hour of the morning. Commuters had already arrived at work. Only a few tourists strolled by. I knew this journey by heart, as I took it myself during my university years. Today, the train held the typical odors of the subway after a daily rush. Smells of sweat and cheap deodorant mingled with coal and musty tunnels. Although half-empty, the subway was suffocating.I tried to relax, but the voice of Ray LaMontagne in my headphones put me in a melancholy mood. “New York City’s Killing Me” rather reflected my inner despair. I mirrored this song by reaching a calmer and sunnier location—Columbia University—where my own sun set. In less than thirty minutes I would be close to him.Earlier this morning I had made another attempt to create. Hands plunged in my inconsistent clay mixture; I had tried to sculpt something. I wanted to immerse myself in his world. I studied his blue canvas and I let my imagination wander. But nothing! I kneaded the clay with my fist, mingled it with my rage and launched it at my worktop angrily. Still nothing! In the end, the mixture had won. The mass had split at the end of the table. Every item that once rested on the worktop was left shattered on the ground. Cans of paint had opened and the pigment stained old pieces of sculpture, now completely broken. It was quite a mess, like my head.I had burst into tears kneeling on the floor, hands in the silken paint. The same paint that Tom had lovingly spread on my body, and which was now drying on the wooden canvas leaning against the wall. I needed him, needed to feel him, to smell him, to touch him, and to lie in his arms so he could soothe me. I wanted to see his smile and his eyes on me in order to breathe again. Determined to be with him, I washed my hands briefly and grabbed my handbag rushing out, leaving that chaos behind.I sat lost in the subway train, idly scraping dried paint from under my fingernails. A drunkard was sleeping off his night, lying on a row of damaged plastic seats at the end of the car. He was dead to the world. I felt more or less the same heaviness. I hadn’t yet recovered my bearing since that previous day of physical and mental pain when we went to get our HIV tests. I still remembered that feeling of helplessness and abandonment. Guilt and the fear of losing him had strangled me. And that feeling was always there in a corner of my mind ready to attack again. I worried that he would leave me and I would be alone as before, and it would be my fault entirely. He would disappear just the way I felt my creativity slowly dying. I was stuck on that train, rocked by the movement, incapable of any reaction. I felt as comatose as the lonesome boozer. In the penumbra of the wagon, reinforced by flashing neon lights, I was looking for my own glow.The subway doors slammed after a ring to silence the people remaining on the platform and locked me in this prison of glass and scrap metal. A woman sat down in front of me with her two daughters, little twin sisters whose feet dangled above the filthy floor. They were the portrait of their mother. The girls played together. They pointed fingers at me, and I realized I still had dry clay under my ear. They communicated in a strange language, whispering and waving. They were evolving in their own world, leaving others behind.Those twins were like the two different women who lived inside of me. They fed each other and couldn’t live without one another—one strong and attractive, the other weak, lonely and scared. They had come alive under Tom’s caresses. They thrived because of his eyes on me and the desire and the pleasure that he sowed in me. I couldn’t control either of them. They turned me mad. I felt I’d become schizophrenic in a way. And my only cure was also the cause of it. Like this subway train, I moved into a labyrinth of tunnels under the surface.And yet, there was also third woman in me, the mother: elder, more experienced. The woman I was before and I could no longer find. She was a well-known artist and an independent woman. I created this person alone, without help from anyone and I could always rely on her. This admired and respected sculptor—the one Tom met at the beginning—had currently lost her way. Which one of my inner selves was he attracted to? What did he see in me? Did he even know who I had become and that I was scared? Did he realize how much I needed him? Did he understand that I love him? I had vainly tried to tell him that simple sentence that no one ever told me: “I love you.” But I lost my balance and I was drowning in my own dark mind. I had to get out of my head and put my thoughts on hold; they were hurting me badly.Sixteen stops after St. Christopher Sheridan Square, the sliding doors opened so I could rush out into the air. I hurried toward the campus to find the visual arts auditorium, the seat of my earlier studies.Tom wasn’t expecting me. I didn’t want to appear like some suspicious wife, spying on him. Hopefully he’d be happy to see me, and it would be a nice surprise. The sandwiches and beers bought at the corner market would serve as an improvised picnic. I wanted to play the carefree and romantic girlfriend but it did me no good. I just needed to feel him close to me and to draw strength from his strength. I needed his smile to lift and make me feel lighter.Students strolled between summer lectures as I walked briskly across campus. The sun beat down on the asphalt, and the grass in front of the main building was completely brown. The sight of the neoclassical pavilions pulled me back to another time. Modern New York was far away, and memories of me as a dynamic and curious student came to my mind. I ambled on the same paths as in my previous life, slaloming between the grass stalls and the diverse halls toward Dodge Hall on Broadway. This red brick building housed the department of visual arts, among others. I proudly climbed the few stairs, welcomed by columns of gray stone. I walked with my head high. I was no longer a student, but a famous artist who would exhibit at the MoMA in a couple of days. I felt a bit nostalgic, but above all so very eager to see the teacher I would have once dreamed of having.The doors of the conference room on the second floor were closed and dim light prevailed. I pushed through the doors and sat quietly in the background without being noticed. Even before I could see him, I felt his presence. His energy radiated throughout the classroom. And I, more than anyone, was able to feel it. My body shivered and my heartbeat accelerated. I caught wind of his fragrance that came in waves, a perfume of cedar, spices and citrus that comprised the smell of his skin. He was there somewhere in the dark.A slide of Gustav Klimt’s painting gave the title of today’s class; while Tom’s deep voice filled the auditorium to announce his presentation: “Klimt and Women.” A small bright light flashed on the desk, illuminating his notes. But the most brilliant light of all came from his face and his smile. Gray glasses emphasized his eyes and accentuated his professorial appearance. He had removed his jacket and rolled the sleeves of his white shirt up above the elbows. His tie was carelessly loosened and he looked so relaxed and manly. When I saw him, I crossed my legs and leaned into the back of my seat. His presence was absolute. It excited me and reassured me at the same time. He took the frame of his glasses in his slender fingers to adjust them on his nose and began:“You can’t imagine Klimt without women, as offerings to his art. By the way, who is able to live without them? A journalist wrote in 1912, ‘… Standing silently in front of his easel… He was surrounded by mysterious naked women who spent their days wandering through the room, to stretch or laze—ready to pose at the slightest wish of the Master to sketch a position or a movement.’”He finished his sentence, biting his lips and moistening them with his tongue. I heard a little sigh three rows below me. Yet, I stayed focused on the speaker who continued and gestured at the transparency:“This painting dated 1901 is called ‘Judith I’ or ‘Judith and the Head of Holofernes.’ It embodies the femme fatale who leads men to their doom. The woman who inspired this beauty is Adele Bloch-Bauer, a demoiselle of the Viennese high bourgeoisie. She might have maintained a relationship of 12 years with the painter, while he kept other mistresses.”“While he was seeing other chicks?” said a young man, chuckling out loud.“Yes.” Tom smiled, “Klimt was a disciple of Free Love as described by the Austrian psychoanalyst Otto Gross. His vision of femaleness was singular for his time. He pictured a modern woman, full of life and energy. He placed her in the shade and in the past to sublimate her. Chic clothes and even nudity became prevalent and evoked a heroine of yesterday.”He drew close to the image and underlined some details to support his arguments. The golden and purplish light of the slide created a colorful sculpture on his white shirt. His refined gestures set an extra softness to this masterpiece. New images of Klimt paintings with rich or poor, known or unknown women, processed—The Water Serpents, The Maiden, Danaë, other Portraits of Adele Bloch Bauer or the Lady with Hat and Feather Boa… —He commented on each work describing each girl and their relationship with the painter.Students regularly interrupted him with questions or suggestive comments. But they were not rude or bored. Instead, Tom captivated his audience; his English accent defined and emphasized his speech. He answered inquiries joyfully with great detail and laughed at any jokes. He spoke of Klimt’s sexuality with openness. Each student’s question was a mark of attention in which he delighted. He was comfortable, light and playful.“This is—The Kiss.” he said, “It is the most famous Klimt artwork and clearly shows his rigor on ornamentation. Here, the man is a stand-in for the painter himself, with his face hidden. He appears here with Emily Flöge. This masterpiece is his vision of eternal love.”“So that’s promising!” said a smitten female voice.“It depends on what you wish darling.” he said, looking toward a girl in the first row. “Here, Klimt had no intention of showing passion or ecstasy, but a tender embrace and the perfect intimacy of this couple.” He concluded, smiling mischievously without ever taking his eyes away from her.He paused and brought two fingers to his lips before drawing the class’s attention to the symbolic and geometric elements.For an hour he flirted freely with female students and challenged males on their ambitions with women, laughing and testing. His spectators were spellbound. He was so mesmerizing and exciting. His little game of seduction didn’t bother me at all. He took such pleasure in it, and this made him even more bewitching. That was how I loved him. I liked the idea that he was a walking fantasy for his students, since for me he was a reality. He was mine!At the end of his class, the auditorium lights came back on and Tom eyed the crowd to give some late advice to his students. He directed his gaze at each of them, one by one. He said he hoped they were inspired by these paintings and they’d be diligent with their studies. There was laughter at this, and sighs from the women and also perhaps from one or two of the young men.His eyes fell on me sitting at the end of the last row. His face brightened with a wide joyful grin, and his blue irises beamed with happiness behind their portholes. So he added to the departing class:“I’m afraid I won’t be available for office visits today. I have an important business appointment.” he said with a nod for me.I heard grumbles as a group of disappointed girls passed by me. I remained in my chair to contemplate the meticulous way he gathered his things and tidied books into his backpack. Then he climbed the steps with his graceful long legs and his nonchalant gait. I raised a paper bag in front of me.“Are you hungry, Professor?”He offered a hand to help me up and put his arm around my waist, kissing my neck.“For you, Heaven, always!”I laughed and followed him into his study. I didn’t really have a choice; he literally dragged me by the hand.“Ta-Dah! Welcome to my very own space.” he proudly said, after closing the door, and turning around to pull me into his outstretched arms.“It hasn’t changed much.” I said, acting unimpressed.“Right, I forgot for a moment that you studied here for your MFA. This was the office of the previous chairman. Did you visit here often?”“Maybe!” I smirked.“Ah… And was my predecessor a good-looking man?”“Maybe!”“Better than me?” he wondered a little worried.“I never fantasized about him, if that’s what you mean.”“And are you fantasizing now?” he asked, his face lively again.“Maybe!” I said, pinching my lips.“Perfect! We are going to have dessert first!” he exclaimed, placing the paper bag on the bookshelf before pulling me against him and rubbing his mouth on my neck.My hands escaped my control and rambled on his muscular arms up to his shoulders. I let my head sink backwards, closing my eyes. I offered my throat to him fully. I felt my desire grow.“You still have clay on your neck and in your hair, and I find that very arousing.” he said.Fortunately he didn’t mind, because I made no effort to make up or dress when I left home like a gale. He delicately brushed my lips with his, as he pushed me against his desk and lifted me to sit on it. We tipped with this subtle labial contact, our bodies magnetic, ready to unite. I felt the pressure of his erection against my belly. He lifted the gray T-shirt over my head and contemplated my naked chest. I hadn’t taken time to put a bra on. My breasts were briefly caressed by cool air, and then enveloped in the warmth of his greedy mouth.My hands flat behind me on the table, I allowed myself to savor every lick. I was going to go under. He grabbed the waist of my black linen trousers and slid them down my legs. Next he did the same with my lace panties and pocketed them, like a trophy. He stood between my legs spreading my thighs with his knees, but he remained fully dressed. His nails traveled my upward along my spine giving me chills. I undid the knot of his tie and opened the buttons of his shirt. My hands lingered on every muscle. His chest heaved with each laborious breath. My kisses lingered on his intoxicating skin. He let himself be overwhelmed by the feeling and moaned.All of a sudden, he swept everything off his table and laid me leisurely on the desk. He grasped my wrists to tilt them over my head before kissing my mouth. His tongue took possession of my flesh and my soul. Yet, I had no idea how much! He found the tie left on the table and stroked my body with the fabric. The ribbon of silk paraded around my legs, brushing my offered pussy, up to my breasts and my arms. While lying on me, he tenderly held my arms and fastened the tie around my wrists.“Now, Heaven, you are mine. You are my prisoner and I will punish you with pleasure.”Kinky! But I had no objection. I welcomed this with a groan of anticipation. Leaning on his elbow, he lightly applied a series of kisses on my eyelids, my nose and, at last, my mouth. His fingers wandered down to my belly, then between my legs. They surrounded my clitoris gently, pulling delicately at it. He turned my head to meet his gaze. His eyes were clouded by desire. He tickled me softly, too softly.“What do you want? You’ll have to tell me, since your hands are tied and you can’t show me…” he whispered in a low, conspiratorial voice.“You, always!”“Me? You should be more specific. What … do … you … want: my mouth, my fingers or my cock? Where and how?”I didn’t take time to think. “I want your fingers in my pussy!”“Are you certain?” he asked, continuing to stroke my clitoris with the same pondering pace.“Hmm, hmm.” I stammered hoisting my hips up to make his hand slip lower.He stopped short and withdrew his fingers.“Shh, sweet naughty girl! I am in charge, I will decide. You’d better not cheat. Say it once more, what … do … you … want?”He caressed my lips with his fingers, the same fingers soaked by my desire.“Your fingers in me … please!” I begged.“When?”“Now!” I cried.“That’s my Anna-Lisa, so passionate and craving.”He thrust one finger into me and gently curled it along my inner wall. He pulled it away and replaced it even slower.“More!” I pleaded, “More fingers, harder, faster … please!”“You are a fast learner, Heaven. I like that!” he said with a dominating gaze.He penetrated me, this time with two fingers, and launched an intense back-and-forth movement. He could feel the pressure rising in me and my body starting to shake. My eyes, constantly maintaining his gaze, were about to close. He paused:“Do you seriously think that I would let you come so easily? I’ll tell you when you have my permission.”I whimpered because I needed so much more. He got up and stood between my open legs.“What do you need, now?” he scanned me up and down.“You. I want to feel you in me. I want your cock in me.”“Oh Heaven, with pleasure!” he smiled.He unbuttoned his pants and pulled them down his thighs, then followed with his boxer shorts revealing his beautiful cock, ready for me. From behind his glasses, he stared at me with lust, motionless.“Right now … please!” I demanded.He placed his hands on my hips and tugged me closer to slide in me slowly. But after only one push he stopped moving. He bent over my chest to take a breast in his mouth. My body arched, I tried to stir under him. I surrounded his head with my tied arms.“Shh, shh, little gourmand!” he said as I settled my hands back on the desk. He rose and retracted entirely.“So?” he asked“Again, your cock, more, please.”He plunged into me with more strength and then completely pulled out. Pleased with himself, he eyed me with mock disdain, stroking my clit with the tip of his penis.“What! Is that all?” he asked with a hint of frustration.“No! More! Don’t stop, fuck me!”He buried himself in me once more and stopped.“You didn’t say…”“Please!” I finished.“There you go…”He kept on this time, with constant and determined movements. His tempo quickened and my pelvis instinctively obeyed each thrust. My pleasure intensified, it grew even more powerful than a few minutes ago. All at once, he stopped everything again.“Nooooooo, not yet…” I wept.“Remember who commands. And yet I thirst for something else.”He leaned to cover me and he cupped a breast in the palm of his hand, fondled it smoothly. He nibbled, pinched and bit my hard nipple. I tightened my legs around his waist, to make him understand that I needed something else, that I wanted something more. However the pleasure he gave me was amazing, and I began to moan his name.“Tom…”“Yes, louder!”“Tom!”“When I’ve heard it enough, I’ll give you your release … eventually.”“Tom… Tom… Tom… Professor… I… I want you.”I almost confessed to him my feelings, but I hushed up in time. I was afraid that everything would end.He smiled with his whole face, his navy gaze, piercing with lubricity, framed with glasses. He stood up and pushed my knees back to set my ankles on his shoulders before thrusting into me again. His cock filled me deeper, ever more vigorously, over and over again, in this ideal angle. My moans had turned into screams, and he growled like a contented tiger. I could see his face tense and his head rear back, revealing his chiseled neck and square jaw. At that moment, I couldn’t hold back my orgasm; ecstasy had spread throughout my whole body. I contracted around him violently in successive long waves. I exploded, propelling my heart, my mind and my soul to every corner of the room.This orgasm had swept everything away, my fears, my doubts and my discomfort. This orgasm had rebuilt my confidence in him, my safety and my love for him. He had taken possession of me, yet I already belonged to him.“What were we saying about your former teacher?” he laughed.

For two days he was taciturn and silent. I didn’t really know why. He was usually so responsive and talkative. But now he had put a distance, a noticeable one, despite his attempts to hide it behind his appetites. He was still caring and attentive. Maybe even more so, as his eagerness to show his desire was constant whenever we were together. He was more insistent and seemed to expect something more. Yet, in spite of every attention and the pleasure he gave me, a side of him was absent. There was something unspoken, something he couldn’t express.He held my hand tightly, as if I might escape him. He quietly watched the illuminated boutiques from the windows of our limousine as we rode up Sixth Avenue. His earnest expression made him look even more mysterious and seductive. He wore a sailor blue Burberry tuxedo with a black collar which increased his usual confidence. I would attend the opening of my exhibition at the MOMA accompanied by the most attractive man in the world. This, to me, was even more exciting than the privilege of my work being displayed in one of the most famous museums.I pretended not to be affected by this event; I didn’t want anything to interfere between us. Yet the reality of it had caught us up.A desperate Max had called a few nights ago. He intended to supervise the preparation of my exhibition by himself, but it turned out to be more laborious than expected. He needed my help to refine the staging and adjust the lights. The MOMA had uniform lighting to prevent any glaring distractions. But Max wanted to add discrete spotlights to emphasize some details. The time required for that work was much more than he’d estimated. So I had to help, quitting my workshop for two days and leaving Tom alone with his paintings.On the first evening of that set-up work, I returned home late and exhausted. I had found the table set with two cold plates and burned candles. Tom was lying in bed with his glasses on and a book open on his chest. His fist was closed like a sleeping baby. He had waited for me all night before falling into dreamland.Obviously, couple relationships weren’t my best skills. I should have called to tell him I was running late. I didn’t know he had cooked me a romantic dinner. Of course, with him, I should be ready for everything. I felt guilty and at the same time I was really happy. I had always thought of myself as pragmatic, but like every girl I melted in front of a romantic gesture.I lay down slowly to take away his book and marked the page before affectionately kissing him on his forehead, stroking his face. I brushed my lips tenderly on his closed eyelids and his nose, to the corner of his mouth. He didn’t move, but something told me he was awake. I whispered:“Gorgeous, I’m so sorry…”Did he pretend to ignore me to punish me for neglecting him? Soon I had my answer when a pair of strong arms surrounded me and his mouth landed on mine. The corner of his lips lifted in a smile:“Hello, Heaven, welcome home!”His embrace enveloped my heart and erased any tiredness from the day, washed away my doubts and my guilt. I tasted him; let him dissolve under my tongue, under my caresses, slowly. Our bodies mingled, our fingers intertwined to form more than one—a voluptuous ball of tenderness. We made love languidly with the adoration of our connected souls.The next morning I awoke still in his arms, to repeat the same type of day - without the dinner, but with the same warm and welcoming arms.Sitting comfortably in the limousine, these naughty memories launched quivers in my stomach, more impetuous than usual. I was anxious and I prayed for this evening to end. I didn’t like being the center of attention. But since I wore a gown lent by a major designer, I would get attention whether I wanted it or not. It was a long, black, silk dress with a V-neckline held by straps. The fabric was embossed with subtle reptilian scales. The cut was stylish and sexy with a glam rock side that matched my wild spirit, especially in these occasions. Still, I would have fancied a thousand times more a dreamy head-to-head with my lover rather than a pompous party. Perhaps I could have a little pre-taste and pull my gallant from his distant thoughts.“Gorgeous, I believe you forgot an accessory.” I blew into his ear.He stared at me quizzically. I looked up at him, falsely ingenuous, and pinched my bottom lip. I was definitely capable of anything with him. He inspired me to such boldness. His response turned into curiosity and excitement. His wide beaming smile betrayed his willingness. I reached his mouth with a finger to brush his lips and then idly down, gradually skimming his chest to his thighs. He dutifully followed my gesture and his attention redoubled when I left his body and carried my caresses over the silk of my dress, black as when we first met. My hands smoothed the silk scales along my legs. They sneaked under the fabric to tickle my inner thighs. I saw his irises darken and heard his breathing quicken. He bent to join his hands with mine. I shivered at his contact that strangely made my tender flesh burn like an inferno. His fingers had reached the heat of my folds already swollen with desire. He titillated me through the fabric of my panties while I turned to liquid. I pursed my mouth to attract a kiss.As our car shifted on to the 52nd, his groan rushed into me and his tongue took possession of mine. I allowed myself to enjoy his caresses, his kisses, his intoxicating smell and taste, and the softness of his skin blended with his masculine strength. Next, our vehicle made two final turns and slowed down. Tom was trying to clear a way with his fingers under the lace of my underwear, becoming increasingly impatient. I stopped his movements despite my frustration, fending him gently off. We had arrived. I caught the black lace thong and slid it down my legs. I pulled out one foot after the other, taking care that my killer heels didn’t tear it.“You forget an accessory for the pocket of your jacket.”Still panting, he picked the lace between his fingers and he found it wet from lust. He smiled satisfied and carried it under his nostrils. He sniffed my scent filled with pheromones and sex.“Heaven, you are mine!” he grinned with the corner of the lips. It sounded nearly like a warning.He folded the panty and slipped it into his chest pocket. We could just guess the fabric, but not the shape.In front of the MOMA, a red carpet was rolled out and some photographers awaited the guests. It was not as prestigious as a movie premier but the few flashes were more than respectable for an artistic exhibition. Max had planned it big. I already hated him for that. Tom got out of the car first, and naturally he extended his hand to help me out. I had barely set a foot outside when I heard reporters shouting my name. Tom offered me his arm and whispered:“Heaven, you’re drop-dead gorgeous. You’re going to be sensational.”I encouraged myself to smile and stay natural. I was a little embarrassed, but the pictures that would be published in testimony had to represent a radiant artist proud of her work, and not a savage woman, mad about her date who, under it all, wasn’t wearing any panties. Yes, I was a fool! I did my best to shorten the photo shooting session and joined Max, who waited with his nose crushed against the glass door of the museum. The lobby was empty; only a few straggling guests headed for the elevators.“Good evening, sweeties! You are beautiful tonight.” Max greeted us taking me in his arms. “Are you ready my Darling? Do you remember the rules? Relax, smile and don’t attack anybody. Beware of drinks and be polite with reporters.” he reminded me once we were inside.“Yes, Daddy! Of course, Daddy! Max, I’m a big girl, you know. Make sure they ask smart questions and I’ll dazzle them with my repartee.” I replied sarcastically.Tom ran a hand across my back and gave his brightest smile to Max:“She will be perfect, don’t worry, I will have an eye on her.”“Thank God!” said Max.“Call me Tom, please!”They both laughed, but I didn’t. I was so nervous. I dreaded the opening of the doors. Tom leaned toward my ear:“Just chill out. You know this place well by now. And if you need to get anything back, you know where to find it.” he murmured suggestively while patting his suit pocket.My stomach twisted at the thought. He wasn’t helping.The sliding doors opened on a blank lit space filled with people crowded around glasses of champagne. Applause rang out and the museum manager came to me with a friendly greeting. In the center of the hall sat my sculpture, the same one in front of which I had met Tom that fateful first night at Max’s party— another torrid memory. On the back wall was my name in large black Helvetica lettering, featured in the title of the exhibition: “Anna-Lisa S. — Retrospective of a Woman.” It was so strange, and also so close to what I had experienced these past few weeks. I was seized with a slight dizziness. If these people only knew that I couldn’t create anymore. If they only realized that I felt like a fraud!Max and the director encircled me and almost literally pushed me into the crowd to meet my first admirer: a critic, a gallery owner, a collector or a journalist? I didn’t have a clue. Tom watched me getting away, unable to keep hold of me. Helen Drescher, Max’s sister, escorted him.Max dragged me into each room to meet many people. Tom and Helen followed us from afar. She introduced her new professor to her acquaintances. I had more difficulty than usual concentrating on the conversation. I constantly looked for Tom to see if he was watching me. Whenever our eyes met, I remembered that I wasn’t wearing anything under my dress and the longing in his icy eyes excited me. I got together with some artists, friends who’d made the effort to come. The conversation was easier with them because we spoke the same language. Then I had the chance to meet J.R., a young French photographer. Styled with his eternal hat and his Italian playboy look, he seemed very comfortable. I had the opportunity to chatter out a few words of Moliere that I remembered. He suggested taking pictures of my future masterpieces. He wanted to project them on the walls of New York. A flattering proposal, but in view of my current ability to create, I wasn’t confident about another collaboration.I carried on with my obstacle course listening to overrated compliments when Tom interrupted us:“Max, may I borrow Anna-Lisa for a few minutes?” he asked.“Yes, of course, she clearly deserves a little break. Be good!” said Max with a mischievous grin.Tom grabbed my arm and led me to the famous black curtain in the hall.“Tom, this is not the moment!” I ribbed, seeing the dark velvet in front of me.He tightened his grip on my arm and pulled me unceremoniously onward.“Follow me!” he ordered.His grip was starting to hurt, and his attitude revealed something else. He walked briskly, his face masked with exasperation. He plucked the curtain aside and went on to the hidden emergency exit. He pulled the door open effortlessly and I had no choice but to follow him into the stairwell. The door suddenly slammed behind us and the noise of the party stopped. Silence echoed in the white concrete space. He broke it, almost screaming:“What are you doing exactly?”“What are you talking about?” I said, surprised.“What do I mean? Don’t play innocent! You are flirting with every man who chats with you!” he shouted.“Not at all, I am only trying to be polite.” I said incredulously.“That’s it, take me for a prat! And this French lad, this artist, he didn’t try to seduce you perhaps? And you didn’t answer him all smiles?”“Wait, I just found his conversation more interesting and less boring than others. But he didn’t make any advances on me.”“Anna-Lisa, you’re really naive. You’re the star of the evening. The men undress you with their gaze because you are so amazing. I heard that guy telling his buddy that he would take you behind the black curtain and make you taste his dick.” said Tom furious.“Oh, that J.R. is a hypocrite! Surely you must know that I’m not interested!” I tried to defend myself,“No. I don’t exactly know! You haven’t spoken to me at all since we got here. And before tonight, I didn’t see you for almost two days. You let me down to go to God knows where: simper before the manager of the MOMA, maybe?”“You’re kidding me!” I lashed out, exasperated. “I’m not the one who goes out to teach lessons and flirt with all his students. It isn’t I that invites them into my office to answer their questions.”“That’s not the same thing!”“Oh great, I fell on the king of bad faith. Sure, it’s not the same. I hate being the center of attention. You know than! And now you’re blaming me. While, apparently, you do like that a lot. Tell me, did you like being my plus-one, tonight? Doesn’t that make you happy? Dating an artist flatters your ego. What are you waiting for precisely? That I’ll further your career or that I’ll let you fuck me whenever little Tommy wants to?”Fury spread over me, driving me to say things that I would certainly regret. Tears burned my eyes, but I was holding them back not wanting to give up, too proud. He had a flush of anger and keep on exploding.“You are the nymphomaniac who wants me, again and again. You need me, admit it. You snuggle in my arms when things go wrong, when you’re afraid or when you don’t speak. I am always there for you.”“You don’t tell me anything either. Oh yes, you can talk and your intellectual conversations are captivating, but you say nothing personal about yourself. And when I have to work for two insignificant days, you set this imperceptible distance. The only contact we have is when you want to touch me. Yes, you can please me, but you are blind. You didn’t even notice that I’m desperate not being able to create and think. I am only able to dream about you, nothing else but you.”“Do you mean I am distracting you and we should stop having sex?” he said cynically.“Whatever! You understand nothing. I am choking. This situation is impossible. I don’t know where I stand. I am losing my mind. I feel like I’m drowning.” Tears of rage rose in my eyes.“What do you want? That I leave you? That I run away? Sometimes I feel that you are doing everything to make me go. You dredge other men to rebuff me. You behave like a whore. It’s unfair to blame me for your inability to create. I admire you. I love you. I need you. Anna-Lisa, I love you enough to die for you and you push me away.” He shouted with fierceness and venom.He loved me? How could he declare such a thing at such a time? This avowal completely destabilized me. He confessed it, yelling and insulting me, when I had been trying to express it for days. And I so longed to hear it, but not like that! I got even angrier, my body tensed and I wanted to slap him. But he stood at a safe distance and I could find no other way than to throw one of my shoes, which he dodged. Spitefully, I flung the other at him, which barely missed head and hit the wall behind him.“You are such a jerk! Why do you think I gave you my panties? Do you imagine I’d offer them to anybody? Do you really think I would prefer to pass them to this French guy? Damn! I am yours, Tom! Why do you think I keep trying when I’m sinking artistically? Who do you think I am waiting for all day long, with no way to cope, alone in my studio? I don’t try to push you away. I am endlessly trying to please you, to seduce you. I love you, silly…”I couldn’t talk anymore, I was drained. He stared at me without moving. His face was still red with rage, his veins bulging. He was astonished:“You are saying you love me. Are you sure? Prove it to me, Heaven!”Instinctively, I shrugged off the straps of my dress, which slid inertly to the ground, revealing my naked body. I found myself standing in the cold stairwell in front of the man I craved. My skin shivered with anticipation:“You say you need me and you love me. Fuck me then! I belong to you.” I implored him, offered.He rushed on me and flattened my stomach against the wall. He locked my right hand behind my back with a firm hold and I felt his robust frame compressed against mine. His stiff cock nudged into the flesh of my butt, and the coldness of the concrete bristled my nipples. The contrast between his warmth and the freshness of the stone wall was mesmerizing. My legs trembled; my whole body ached for him.His lips crashed down on my neck, possessing me. This was not a simple kiss, but a way to claim me, to brand their dominion over my sensitive skin. My head swayed and he demanded his prey, devouring me with licks and teeth. I closed my eyes to experience the bewitching contrast between the hotness of his ample and inflamed frame, and the coolness of the stone. The scent of his cologne was transfixing, paralyzing me. I slipped lazily between his hands, which engulfed my breasts and kneaded my belly. The friction of his tuxedo on my sensitized skin ignited every inch of my body, sending waves of exquisite impatience through me. His fingers slid into my swollen slit. He pulled me against him and stole a groan from me.I placed my palms on the wall for balance and I spread my legs pressing my pelvis back on his erection, to urge him on. He continued to rouse my clitoris with his fingers and created a path to my already wet entrance, which was begging for him. He growled in my ear:“You are mine, mine alone, do you understand?”As approbation, I moaned. I registered that he hastily unzipped his fly with one hand. The hand that had just left my breast, a breast he pinched to inflict an unbearable pleasure. I then felt an absence even more painful.He dipped his cock between my butt and caressed every curve of my tender skin until he reached the welcoming entrance of my pussy. He filled me with a single thrust, harsh and deep, stretching my walls with delight. Each jolt, each movement tightened me close to him, and each time my chest was crushed against the concrete wall. Each stroke tickled every nerve ending and triggered floods of ecstasy that overflowed like a tsunami in me. It was a demonstration of anger and passion. He claimed my body; he won my mind as a conquering warrior. He owned me with every back and forth, causing me pleasure, creating an indescribable bond between us. His muscles tensed, and he clung to me, sealing his mouth on my shoulder. His one hand on my chest, the other with fingers still around my clitoris, tortured me. This propelled me, moaning, onto the stone wall. Each bang hammered my raptured flesh. The beats produced by these shocks stunned me. I burst in an intense orgasm, against the wall. My legs staggered but his body weight supported me. In time with me, he unleashed inside me with a visceral growl. I melted into him, leaning into him, bathed in the bliss we shared, by this violent and voracious reconciliation. His face was buried in my shoulder while his breathing calmed. My body didn’t belong to me anymore and I had sold him my soul.“I love you, Tom.” I whispered, worn out.“I love you, Anna-Lisa.” he sighed. 



Sex on the Beach
Chapter Summary
Tension and lack of communication are rising between Anna-Lisa and Tom. Will a romantic weekend in the Hamptons help then to solve their problems?
Chapter Notes
WARNINGS/TRIGGERS/AUTHOR NOTES: sex on the beach.NOTES/ADVERTISEMENTS: I hope the contrast between this very cheesy moment and her feelings is clear enough. Thanks to my beta-reader @quoting-shakespeare-to-ducks. Copyright - 00062229-1



I was wearing my sculptor clothes, a simple tank top and gray linen pants, but had no intent to work. For some time I hadn’t even been trying, preferring to escape reality and to dream about something else. I settled comfortably on Moroccan cushions that served as a sofa. The window was wide open as I listened to the noises of the street, the honk of the taxis, the merchants shouting in their shops and the delivery trucks with exotically accented drivers. Outside, New York was alive and I felt home. A fan refreshed the room, pulling in the welcomed summery air. The smell of hot pizzas and cupcakes mingled with the heated asphalt.Sitting cross-legged, I listened to the music of James Blake in the background—a honey voice, an English voice. It echoed my English reading, an old edition of Pride and Prejudice borrowed from Tom’s bookshelves. The story was familiar after seeing many film adaptations, but I’d never considered reading the book. Was this an attempt to decipher my own British man? Maybe. Since the opening of my exhibition, his presence had become invasive.At first, I adored his messages on my phone and especially his endless sexting. Not to mention the phone calls to check on how I was feeling, and telling me unflinchingly how much he loved me. But lately, this wasn’t sweet at all anymore. His calls were starting to feel like an inquisition. He always wanted to know where I was, with whom, and what I was doing. His gestures and attention were increasingly possessive. He was overbearing and stifling; and I needed to breathe.I knew he was trying to comfort me and encourage me to start sculpting again, but he was clumsy. His support had turned into a pressure I didn’t know how to handle.Attempting to immerse myself in my book, I was unstrung to see my mobile lighting up and vibrating again. On one previous occasion, I hadn’t even responded. Now, I was crumbling under even more anxious and insistent messages. His last call was 30 minutes ago. He’d asked what he could bring to eat, so I knew he’d be back soon. I was torn between wanting to feel him with me and the need to be alone and quiet.The elevator announced Tom's arrival, but there was no usual happy song to accompany him. He entered the loft and dropped his backpack down along with bags of groceries and a mound of mail on the kitchen table. He collapsed into a chair and intoned a discreet “hello.” No questions, no starting conversation, he just remained silent with his nose in a letter he’d opened. He was acting curious, almost as taciturn as Darcy, but I was actually relieved that he didn’t say more. I answered with another droopy “hello” and tried to continue reading. Dismally, I realized I’d been reading the same sentence over and over again. Why should he ask how my morning went? He already knew. He’d been calling every hour!I got up from my fleecy sofa and moved to the refrigerator to get a bottle of water. I placed one near his hand and was rewarded by only a crude “thank you,” he didn’t even raise his head. Never mind, I didn’t especially want to talk, because his silent presence was almost oppressive. I grabbed the paper bags and put our dinner in the fridge.“I went to my flat to collect my mail.” he said in a mournful voice.“Ah…” I replied.I returned to sit in my corner and quietly took my book in hand, watching him discreetly. He slid a letter back in its envelope and hid it inside the jacket hanging on the back of the chair. Then, he pushed the other correspondence away with a sigh. He slumped in his seat expanding his legs under the whole table. He contemplated me with a pensive look.“Are you hungry?” he asked.“Not really,” I said, eyes set on my pages.“Neither am I. We can wait.” he sighed, “You didn’t work today?”“No!” I replied crossly.“Do you need me to help you?” he said softly.“No!” I said, even more irritated.I didn’t lift my eyes to him. I hoped he’d comprehend that I didn’t want to talk. I was hoping he’d step down, otherwise we would repeat the same deaf discussion, and ultimately fight. And obviously, we would then make love, clinging to each other in a desperate attempt to forgive and retain this mysterious thing that was about to escape us.He paused for a moment and said:“Helen offered to lend me her Hampton house for the weekend. I believe it would be a nice change from here. What do you think?”“Why not. It’s a nice property along the beach. Max brought me there a couple of years ago.”“Max and Helen seem to have benefited from their art business.”“Max is a self-made man, and he is awfully successful. He has a real talent for identifying artists. Helen married a banker that her brother introduced to her, as well as being a Dean at Colombia.”“She doesn’t seem happily wedded, though. I believe she’s making advances at me.”What was he trying to do exactly? Checking if I was as jealous as he? This wasn’t the case.“What? You don’t even react? Doesn’t that affect you?” he asked, a bit annoyed.Finally, I eyed him scornfully.“Honestly, you don’t hate her attention and you even feel flattered about it. However, I could cut her heart out with a spoon, if it is any comfort to you. Although Max might resent me a little.”He forced a lifeless laugh.“Yes, well, that would be a bit extreme… So you trust me?”“Yes absolutely. Don’t you?” I said, defying him.“Yes, of course!”Liar, I thought. He quickly created a diversion.“Pack your bags. We are leaving as soon as I find a car.”“You could ask Max. I’m certain you would adore driving his convertible Jaguar!”“Oh gosh! I have always dreamed about that.” he grinned at last,” Are you sure he’ll hand it over for a few days?”“I hope so, he has often lent it to me.”“Oh! I can imagine you behind the wheel, pedal to the metal. Wild!” he said in a wink.All of a sudden I forgot every tension. I gave Max’s phone number to Tom. After Tom had convinced him, and Max understood that we didn’t want him and his new beau to accompany us, the case was settled.Two hours later, I felt like Thelma and Louise sitting in Max’s brand new car. The radio roaring, sunglasses on, Tom sang an old Will Smith tune. I harmonized the chorus, wearing my own glasses, along with an unnecessary scarf around my neck—just to see it flying freely in the breeze. It had been quite some time since the mood was so light between us. It was a breath of air that we both needed. His awkward silence was replaced by his melodious laugh.The sun was high in the sky, and Manhattan buildings rapidly gave way to Brooklyn pavilions and then to Long Island villas. The Sunrise Highway on State Road 27 was uncrowded. Travelers were already ahead of us, or they were waiting for the weekend to go. The landscape was less green than in spring, because the sweltering summer burned the vegetation. But the ocean, greenish blue, was lost in the horizon on both our sides, reflecting the bright sun. This road trip was like two hours of full relaxation. I took advantage of the speed of the car, raising my hands in the air. A sign of freedom that made him laugh out loud.Helen’s second home wasn’t a small fisherman’s cottage, but a huge property just outside Sag Harbor. It had its own private beach along Long Beach. The view on the Fisher Port, filled by the yacht club’s boats, was implacable. The house possessed an oversized garden, many terraces and a swimming pool next to the sea. This mansion could have belonged to Gatsby with its private pier.When Tom parked the Jaguar in the drive, his mouth fell open in admiration. After verifying we were in the right place, he enjoyed himself like a kid at the arrival of the ice cream truck in the street. He marveled and lifted me in his arms, spinning with delight. I gave up. This weekend was undeniably romantic. Thank you, Helen!Inside, his joy was in no way deflated. The designer-decorated house provided a vast kitchen, a living room larger than my own loft, and a gigantic bay window overlooking the beach, punctuated by white columns. Helen had managed to create a warm and modern atmosphere in this enormous neoclassical space. The contrast was brilliant. Its luxury was elegant yet not ostentatious. The building consisted of ten bedrooms and nearly as many bathrooms.“Do you want to take the tour?” I asked.“You’re kidding! I’m dying to see everything! Where will we sleep?”“In my favorite room, guess which one.”He dumped our few bags near the stairs, and pulled me by the hand to leap up the monumental central staircase. We discovered the rooms one after the other, all flawlessly decorated in different shades. They were cozy in their own ways. The last one, at the end of the hall, was smaller but had a tiny private balcony facing west to the sunset. It was impeccably white like a little cocoon: a nest of cotton, woven linen and fur, with lovely antique furniture and a king-size bed overfilled with pillows.“This is your favorite room!” he grinned proudly.“How did you guess?”“That’s the color you use in your sculpting, and it has your sweetness. And perhaps the smile you made when I opened the door was more than helpful.”“Cheater!” I teased, jumping on the bedspread with outstretched arms. He imitated me, and the elastic mattress made me bounce. We both lay back, and fawned over the beautifully molded ceiling and the massive suspended fan.“This house is paradise.” he said.“Yes. Helen was sweet to lend it to you. You’re a lucky bastard.” I said with innuendo in my voice.He didn’t stress that out and preferred to kiss me gingerly:“You are my Haven.”I let myself go under that exquisite kiss, under the way he soothed me, and showed me that he loved me even when I broke apart. I needed nothing else at the moment. But something held me back, though. I was simply not ready. Instead, I suggested he save his energy to go fill the pantry and visit the village. I already knew he’d enjoy its jovial and charming atmosphere.We played tourists walking hand in hand. We traveled around the harbor, admiring the main street shops still held by locals, rather than by stylish brands. The scent of iodine, sand and summer flowers infused the village. We ate an ice cream on Havens Beach, another paradise, forgetting reality, lulled by the water; a typical moony holiday in a bubble outside the City.After a stint at The American Hotel to collect our dinner for the night, and a stop at the grocery store to load our shopping bags, we dropped in at a renowned wine shop. The wine-seller was a handsome young man who helpfully advised me on different wines. He was friendly and cute. Tom didn’t waste any time to come closer and wrap his arm around my waist to mark his possession. While we tidied away our purchases in the car’s trunk, the grocery bags and the two white bottles of Chablis that we’d just bought, he asked my opinion about the shop assistant. I replied that I had found him very gay, which seemed to reassure him. The Jaguar transported us home. Even the wealthy residents and visitors of Sag Harbor peered at this new car model with envy.We set the table on the terraces along the beach. Tom busied himself in the house searching for god-knows-what. I placed the starter and the main course on plates, and I popped out the appropriate dishes. Tom intermittently reappeared in the kitchen, to carry something to the terrace. He proudly returned to tell me that everything was ready, and suggested I put on a dress for the occasion.I had remembered to pack sensual lingerie, but not necessarily a sexy little black dress. But I had to smile when I discovered that Tom had slipped one in my bag at the last moment. I freshened up briskly and put on my lace panties and the very well-chosen dress. I ambled down the paved path leading to the beach. The sun was sinking under the horizon. I saw the table had been set with a white tablecloth and candlesticks in the middle. All the candles of the house had been buried in the sand or placed on the terrace around the table. Normally I would have found it too-much, but since it was him, I melted. I let myself get caught up with the Romanticism. He rejoined me with lobster corn chowder in bowls. He had switched his blue linen shirt to a cream Henley polo. His jacket was suspended on a chair, marking his place.The dinner was utterly perfect. The soup was delicious and the wine at the exact temperature. Our fingers were immovably entwined across the table, and the candles were reflected in his icy-blue eyes. I couldn’t stop staring at him. The conversation was outgoing. The main dish - steamed blue crabs - were true treats, not to mention the chocolate cheesecake which was better than sex. There was a spoon battle to steal an extra bite on the other plate. I tried to distract him with moans of lust, but when it came to chocolate he seriously knew how to defend his interests.The second bottle of white wine was uncorked and we pleasantly let ourselves get tipsy.“Who said anything about heaven?” I giggled.“Hehehe, I’m not sure that Adam and Eve had chocolate.”“My god, this must have been hell!” I laughed.Being with him was so agreeable without the worry, without the fear, and without questions. Alcohol helped and so did the easy-going atmosphere. Nothing other than us counted.“We should go swimming.” I suggested, throwing off my stilettos into the sand. I stepped back toward the waves watching him defiantly.“I haven’t a swimming costume.” he said.“Adam didn’t, either. Come on!” I said, slipping off my dress on the beach.He tossed his shoes off and ran after me. My pale skin glowed under the rising moon, set off by the lack lace of my underwear let my milky flesh glimpse. Laughing, he tried to catch me, even though removing his polo and his pants proved more difficult than expected and that slowed him. I provoked him, smirking, removing my bra and challenged him to come and get me. He was still on the sand when I already had my feet in the water. I leaned forward to jump out of my panties which I threw behind me, looking at him over my shoulder. He grabbed and sniffed them. He imitated my gestures, and his boxer shorts landed just next to my panties on the sand. With his long and athletic legs, he easily caught up to me in the ocean and pulled me into his arms. His hands surrounded me as he lifted me against his back. He kissed my neck carrying me away in the waves that almost submerged us.Deeper in the sea, he flung me in the water, laughing heartily. I swam back splashing. He drifted to me, with a false-threatening face and he dived under. The water was pitch-dark and appeared bottomless, I wasn’t able to see him and I expected him to touch me or to emerge somewhere around me. Yet, nothing happened and time was everlasting. I screamed his name, but no answer. I panicked for a few seconds. Then with relief, I felt his hands stroke up my legs and my back, and his mouth rushing on my belly and between my breasts out of the water. His smiling face came up to my height when I fell on him trying to drown his head under the sea. However he was bigger and stronger than me. So, I was only clinging on his shoulders, legs around his waist. He held me firmly against him. I could already feel his erection onto my belly and I immediately burned to surrender.My mouth took possession of his. The alcohol made me audacious, and my problems no longer existed. My body endured the same need, the same uncontrollable attraction. Our kisses captured every feeling, every moment of sharing. They knew how to trigger this desire so sweet and familiar. They knew how to communicate all this love that we couldn’t otherwise express. His tongue welcomed me, enveloped me, as he closed his grip on me, to keep me, to take me. The taste of salt mingled with that hint of chocolate and Chablis.The waves hauled down on our entwined bodies, rocking us. We were unbalanced by the strength of the ocean. Lingering on my mouth, Tom brought me to the shore. He drifted with difficulty, waves slowing his progression. Water dripped off of our skin. Our lips parted briefly to passionately kiss each other on the cheeks, chins, and necks in a frantic combat of kisses. Longing made us gasp. He moaned and sniggered with pleasure into my ear. Suddenly, we found ourselves on the sand with the back and forth of water caressing our legs. He used his body to protect me from the downfall, so I was lying on him. He fondled my back and my butt, trapping me against him. My fingers ran through his wet hair and my lips brushed his neck, launching quivers under my touch. Salt blended with the enchanting taste of his skin.Between my legs the heat increased. His cock hardened, and the smallest movement tickled my sensitive flesh. I swayed my hips leisurely along his shaft and I rubbed my clitoris, moaning in his mouth. Thousands of feelings converged in me, and I could tell that he felt the same because his abs vibrated under me and he moaned. He placed his forehead on mine, and stared at me through his long eyelashes, his eyes half-closed.“Tom, I love you.” I whispered.“I love you, Haven. My Anna-Lisa.” he huffed.I lay carefully to languidly slide his cock inside me. Feeling his member filling this hollowness in me, retaining this contact that left an absence whenever he went away me, and rediscovering this intense caress initiated a spasm of pleasure and I moaned. He held his breath before retrieving my mouth. I started an erotic and undulating return fare. The tip of my breasts stroked his chest at every delicate move. His torso heaved close to me. My whole body was subjugated to incessant caresses, from water, from the crisp air of the night, from his skin, from his kisses and his cock buried in me.“I love watching you take your pleasure.” he told me, gently guiding me to sit on him.He gazed at me while leaning back on the sand, gradually moving his hands to cup my breasts. The moon highlighted my curves with its subtle light, and my swollen breasts were irresistible for him. He stroked them, rubbing his thumb over my nipples. I rolled my hips more eagerly, seeking my pleasure again and again, faster and deeper. The shock of our flesh echoed our moans and the rumbling waves.My ecstasy was growing and I felt him on the verge of his release. But I wanted more, I needed more. I motioned him to sit up and he held me locked up into his arms. Our bodies were so close, merging at each hip movement. Our mouths devoured and I clenched at him. Our bodies danced in this slinky pace, sitting together in the sand, becoming one. We were wrapped in this urgency. Our faces sunk in each others’ necks in this wave that washed over us, this orgasm that plunged us into the abyss, trembling and panting, united.We stayed motionless for a few minutes, our breaths quietened. A feeling of completeness bathed us into oblivion and consciousness of ourselves.Suddenly, he rolled us around on the beach, chortling. Sand tickled me all over, but I didn’t care, I was with him. We couldn’t see much by the faint moonlight, yet we had to find our clothes scattered on the dunes. This was a funny tracking game. Afterward, we met under the outdoor shower to wash away the salt and the sand. He clutched me in his arms again and I leaned my back against him, leaving access for his kisses to my nape. The night was getting cold and I started to shiver. He became worried and wrapped his jacket around my shoulders to keep me warm. We ran, soaked, to the house. He rushed inside to find dry towels and I waited, freezing on the terrace.When I put my hands in his jacket pocket to snuggle myself in, I dug up the mail he had put there earlier in the day. The envelope was rather large, with an embossed, good quality paper. The stamp was from the UK - quite a hefty mail to fly over the ocean. I recalled his taut face and his mysterious silence of the late morning and I couldn’t restrain my curiosity. I didn’t have the right to read his correspondence; I was invading his privacy but it was stronger than me. The envelope held an invitation engraved in gothic letter: Jane Katherine A. and Luke Alexander Charles W. announced their wedding in Westminster Abbey in one month. Why didn’t he tell me? Was he ashamed? A handwritten letter dropped out of the cardboard and whirled to the floor. I picked it up and once more my interest was bigger than my discretion. A pretty girly handwriting greeted Tom and began an apology.Tom came back with fluffy towels and found me looking at his mail. He snatched the paper.“Give me that! It’s mine!” he stated.Sadly I already read the whole letter. I had forgotten my foray into his life, and anger had possessed me.“What is it?” I cried.“That’s none of your business!”“What do you mean? Your ex-fiancée is about to marry your best friend? And it doesn’t concern me? You want me to trust you, that I confide in you my fears and my secrets, and you didn’t tell me you were once engaged to another girl. How many things are you hiding? How many things did you lie about?” I shouted.“I’ve never lied to you. I thought you trusted me.” he gulped with frustration.“Trust you! How do you want me to fully believe in you, if you keep things from me.”“Anna-Lisa, I love you and I don’t want to lose you.” he pleaded.“Tom… I love you, and it’s freaking me out to lose you too… But… I don’t know… You lie to me, you harass me on the phone, you don’t talk to me, you play with me, and I don’t know what game. I can’t anymore, Tom. I need you and I am not able to reach you.”“Do you think it’s easy to get you? You tell me nothing. I never know what you have in your head. I can’t understand you. I have no idea who you are.” he shouted.I didn’t figure out what to answer. I knew he was right. I couldn’t reveal myself. Anyway, his words were painful. Even though I had made so much effort, I had the impression that he had managed to break me. I had tried so hard to give him something, to offer myself entirely. Yet I had failed. I handed him his jacket and I seized a towel that I draped around me. I raced to the bedroom and slammed and locked the door.A while later I heard Tom tap at the door.“Anna-Lisa, please let me in. Haven…”I recognized his pleadings; he once wept them behind another door. I shouted at him to leave me. But he continued.“Anna-Lisa, I love you. I’m sorry, I didn’t want to hurt you.”I didn’t open. Lying on my bed, staring into the void, I heard him lean against the wood and the beam of light under the door showed his shadow. He kept talking to me in a calm tone, begging me to listen. I didn’t want to, but I clearly tuned into his voice and I understood every word. He spent the night outside, revealing me everything I wished to know about his life, his past love stories, the betrayal of his fiancée with his best friend, and his consuming passion for me.At the first hour of the morning, I opened the door at last. Exhausted, we lay on the bed in each other arms and we fell asleep for the rest of the day. I knew that once again I would forgive him and I would sink even deeper into my doubts and fears.

The first autumn rain battered the windows of my studio. It echoed in the room. Consequently I woke up in a deserted bed; the other side was heatless. His sports shorts and T-shirt were still folded on the shelf and his sneakers settled in their proper location. For a moment I had a sinking feeling. Finally, I heard a torrent tumbling against the glass pane of the shower. He wasn’t running outside. He was getting ready to leave for Columbia U to deliver his lecture. When I saw him I was a bit relieved, but still discomforted.Water flowed over his skin and his muscular body, yet his movements were sluggish. His features were tense and he looked tired. I studied him, curled up in the sheets, with this odd void that dug in my stomach. This void was bruising and oppressive.Our romantic weekend didn’t have the desired effect. After our sleepless night of explanations, we couldn’t loosen up. I had heard him but didn’t know how to answer. I felt this chapter still wasn’t closed. We decided to return New York earlier than planned. Ultimately, this weekend had been gloomy; we spent it locked in my studio under the rain. We clung to one another without really talking and unable to detach. Establishing a distance had allowed a rift to set up between us, and we held on to each other so we wouldn’t fall in. Our moves were tender, but also careful. Each embrace was thought-out and desperate.Now I understood his jealousy and his fear of being betrayed again. I shared this freakish fret of abandonment for other reasons. But I didn’t know how to ease this pain. So far, only his presence had managed to soothe me.He came out of the shower and wrapped himself in a dry towel, heading to the sink intending to shave. Then he noticed me peering at him and timidly smiled in the mirror. He walked slowly towards me and lay down on the sheets. He brushed a lock of hair from my forehead and placed it behind my ear. He caressed my face with his fingertips.“Good Morning, Haven.” he said tenderly.“Good Morning, Gorgeous.” I said, following our ritual. But my smile didn’t sparkle as usual, and neither did his.His presence was so intense it filled the whole the space, creeping into me as a need, a drug, a snake. He annihilated any form of reasoning and consistency. I pulled him against me, my lips on his, like a junkie injecting her fix, in an act of absolute deprival and dementia. He didn't balk and spun over me with the same urgency, the same need—the need to be close to me, be with me. His tongue found mine and claimed it frantically. I moaned, forsaking myself without the will to resist.He bit my chin, and then his head drifted down my body. He buried his nose in my flesh and indulged himself with my fragrance, my taste, and the delicacy of my skin. My back arched under the sensation of his beard on me. The pleasure would erase the sadness, fill the abyss and at last allow me to live again. My drug—him—always gave me this ecstasy.Tom whipped off the sheets that winded up over me and burrowed his face into my belly and between my legs. He nibbled the flesh of my thighs, thrusting his fingers into my hips. My pussy almost pulsed, offered to his touch. He ran his tongue along my slit from the bottom up and I closed my fists on the white sheets. He clutched at my clitoris with his entire mouth and bred voluptuous waves that slinked through my spine. His stubbly beard heated the skin of my thighs with excitation. Two fingers were shoved into me, designing vivid and repetitive circles. Instinctively, I raised my pelvis to anchor to his lips, moaning and begging him to continue. My leg muscles trembled uncontrollably and I straightened my knees, gasping as I reached my orgasm.He suddenly brought himself up and rudely lay back down on top of me. I could taste my latent aroma in his thirsty kisses. He gripped my breasts with urgent strength. I was his toy, he owned me.Then, sitting back on his heels, he slid my body against him so my hips met up to his crotch. He grabbed my ankles and placed my feet on his chest. So I balanced there while his long and hard cock plunged into me with vigor. He fucked me eagerly and fiercely. I felt life pouring into me, a towering vertigo close to torture. Our movements weren’t devoted; our exchange was animal and brutal. We were both seeking to steal our own pleasure, drowning in sensation. This touch was neither salving, nor comforting. It was a battle in which we sank into oblivion.Each jolt hit my sensitive point. I pushed my feet into his torso and contracted my muscles before another orgasm. I screamed and groaned with delight. His face tensed, his jaw jutting forward. We didn’t call out each other’s names. We shared nothing. This was only a kind of crime, knocking down to feel and forgive, if it was even possible.After a feral and impressive climax, we found ourselves leaning side by side to let our breaths slow. Then without a word, he walked to the washstand to shave. I put on a large T-shirt and, I dragged myself to the kitchen.“Do you want to eat breakfast?” I asked.“No thank you, I’ll just grab a coffee.”This was a job in my line. I served up some toast with cheese. I made his latte and a black coffee for me. Once he was clean-shaven, elegantly suited, and his hair impeccable, he came to take his coffee mug. He drank it in one go, without even sitting down. Next he leaned over me and kissed my forehead.“Have a good day, Haven.”“Have a good day, Gorgeous.” I replied in a monotone.Hastily, he fled the loft without another word.Once alone, my thoughts began to wander aimlessly, swamped in my madness. I loved him so passionately, loved him to death. The butterflies in my stomach were eating me from the inside. Yet I felt so far from him. I couldn’t understand him and he seemed just as lost. I didn’t always understand myself either. Today, I expected the hours that I would spend waiting for him to be even longer and cruel than usual.My phone rang, interrupting my ramblings. I wondered if might be Tom caught up in his infidelity obsessions, but the screen displayed the name of Max.“Good morning, darling, how are you? Did you have a nice weekend in the Hamptons?” asked Max with his familiar playfulness and his usual way of bombarding me with questions.“Hello, Max! I’m fine, thank you, and yes this weekend was pleasant. Thanks again for loaning us your car, Tom enjoyed it a lot.” I said softly.“You sound tired. I guess I woke you up.”“Yes … but I’m glad to hear you, so it doesn’t matter.” I lied, except that I was really happy to talk to him. I could tell I missed Max had missed me.“Perfect! I have a busy day to organize, so I’m calling you early. I was hoping to meet you retrieve my new ‘precious’—my Jaguar. I’m warning you, though! If she has a single scratch, your man had better run fast to save his balls!”I laughed, “He runs every day in the Park, and so unless you climbed back on your treadmill, you can always try to catch up with him.”“So that’s the secret of his athletic body. Lucky girl!”I giggled again, but there was something fake in my voice.“Since I’m coming to your place, I’ll happily take a look at your work over a coffee.”“I don’t think I should show you our latest work. I would prefer that Tom be here, too.”In my anxiety, I was forced to lie shamelessly. I threw out the first excuse that came to mind. Max was my best friend, but also my agent. How could I tell him that I just couldn’t create any more?“Yes, you’re right. So I think I should take you out to a restaurant in my Jaguar. I could stop and grab you later in the morning, so at least we can spend time together. I don’t get to see you since Tom monopolizes all of your time. When he returns early afternoon, the three of us could examine your creation together.”“Tom works until tonight … and I really don’t want to go out.”“Stop being such a toad. If Tom isn’t available, I could still bring takeaways to you at home.”“Uh … In that case, I think I prefer eating out.”Whatever happens, Max absolutely must not see the studio.“OK then! Sorry, I have another call. I’ll pick you up around noon.”Max hung up and I realized that he would definitely find a way to have the last word. He would try to enter, his curiosity would prevail. I had to find a solution, at all costs. I changed my T-shirt and slipped into the linen pants I wore all week. I set my iPod on shuffle mode and turned the volume up. I fetched my sculpting tools. I had meticulously cleaned and tidied them every day, if nothing else. I displayed them loosely at the center of the table, and told myself “Just let yourself go, you have to get there.”I started to randomly combine my different clays. I added too much water at first, and the mass had no consistency. Next I introduced too much powder to dry it and it became brittle and grainy. I couldn’t even build my base. My hands moved independently. I let the block escape many times. The mud between my fingers evoked nothing.The simple touch of kneading used to bring me joy, but no more. At one time, my instinct and mind traveled and a sculpture would rise up effortlessly. I could blend memories, feelings and inspirations. Images used to appear in my head and my hands would recreate them in three dimensions guided by the softness and flexibility of the clay.That magic didn’t happen today. No sensations were satisfactory. I felt only emptiness, loss, frustration and desolation. I wasn’t myself. Although I tended to let my fantasy ramble, it returned always to Tom: his smile, his skin and his eyes on me.In despair, I decided to carve his profile from memory. I knew his body by heart. I had to start over several times to shape some semblance of a head. My fingers dug into this abrasive clay, so far from the softness of his skin. I tried to reproduce the bridge of his nose and his eyebrow. My instinctive physical memory of the mechanics of sculpture failed me. In spite of all this, I did successfully sculpt something, but it bore no resemblance to Tom.Desperation sank in and tears came without warning. I wasn’t going to achieve my task. I had to relax and breathe. I stopped working. I got some water, but couldn’t drink it. My sobs were too strong. I shook while holding the glass. I tried to draw a breath at the window, without luck. I attempted to sing Billie Holiday lyrics—“In My Solitude”—again without success. The water was impossible to swallow; too many tears. As a last resort I opened the medicine cabinet and found a box of Xanax®. I immediately took two pills. Afterwards, I screamed with all my energy to stop my crying fit.Cole Porter and his "Boston Beans which even do it" reminded me of my childhood and my little brother—Jesse—who liked this song. “Come on, you can make it! You carved Tom. The man who takes the whole space in your heart.” I returned to my position and carried on slowly. This time, the similarity was better, but there was something morbid in his features. There was no essence, no light. I was creating a death mask.Out of the blue, I remembered Jesse’s image in his coffin. I grew despondent. My tears mingled with panic: of Max knowing my failure, of Tom abandoning me, of feeling rejected by the people I loved, and at the end, of killing Tom who would rejoin Jesse in his grave. A child’s lifeless face and grainy profile were superimposed under my fingertips. The devoted gaze of Tom, the one he turned on me, dazzling and bewitching… this look faded.I reached for the glass of water to try to calm down, but it slipped from my fingers, fell to the ground and broke. I collapsed on the floor and howled in distress. My tears redoubled. I grabbed the crystal pieces in my hands and held them firmly. I cut my flesh but the injury and the blood that flowed did nothing to dull my pain.A zombie took my place, a moving body with an incoherent mind. I saw my mother’s bleed out in the car accident. My mom, whom I could never convinced to love me. I thought of my absent father. I imagined myself as this child seeking to satisfy everyone, to be loved and to be forgiven for not saving her brother. I was a poisoner. Tom would also perish from my venom—my love. This love had already wiped out the artist in me. I was emptied out and my mind clenched. A tiny hand, a single gesture and I could help it to fly, to be free.I walked to my bed loft, mechanically pushed by grief and absence. I had no idea of the time that elapsed. I had been a fool, my behavior irreparable. I felt myself float out of my body, away from my sculpture and away from Tom. I dreamt about Max’s voice in the street as I slumped down on my mattress, among boxes of medicine, the empty bloodstained tube of Xanax® falling from my hand. I listened one last time to the chorus of “Dying Slowly Is Better Than Killing Myself” by Tindersticks, before losing consciousness and leaving my world. to be continued....

PART 2
Tom 
Every underground in the world is similar; its operation, its colours, its stations and even its passengers. But always, it characterizes the heart of the city. It throbs imperceptibly at a different beat. It breathes an atmosphere that makes it unique and pulls you in another world every time. Tourists are alike, travellers dress as everywhere else, with identical distractions: listening to music through headphones, reading a book or a newspaper, fighting sleep or giving in to it, playing on their phone or having unnecessary conversations. The accents from Queens or Brooklyn reminded me that I wasn’t in London anymore, so did the New York Times. The grumble was significantly different. Even the smell meant that I was far from home.I was standing amidst an evening crowd in a nipped tube. I held the iron pole, my laptop under my arm. People were just as packed as in England. Pushchairs also pranged into my calves, not to mention brollies dripping on my trousers.In fact, I had just wrapped a day of conferences to prepare for the new academic year. I was patiently waiting for the 22-minute journey to end, to meet Anna-Lisa in her studio, again. I was a bit worried to find her. The weekend wasn’t as delightful as expected. I had a strange feeling; like I failed, like I had fallen short. I knew this was an irrational feeling. But somewhere deep inside me, I knew she needed me. When I thought about her, which happened at every moment, her eyes haunted and implored me.Since the first day we met in front of this delicate sculpture of her, broken, she had erased other girls from my memory. I longed to mend that riven statue, to reconstruct that woman.Those “others” who crossed my path, so kittenish, moody and girlish, had become so bland compared to that woman. I was bewitched by her silver-blue eyes, her elegance and her harmonious gestures. I immediately wanted to know everything about this complex but natural woman; so fragile and strong, light and deep, cheerful and blue. She was totally sublime in her femininity and in her contradictions.Consequently she became my obsession. She took over the space in my mind, over my reopened scars. The more my love for her grew, boundless, the more she escaped me. I resisted all day to the need to call and hear her voice, and calm my fears. I offered her a few hours of room and freedom. I craved for her, but worry of being abandoned increased over time. This impersonal train was carrying me to her, yet my thoughts never left her.At first, it was my body that yearned for her, a primary male sexual temptation. I was sure that would pass and I would grow tired, as usual. But immediately, her presence had a deeper meaning.There was a morning, a specific time when I woke up by her side. For several days I’d kept my clobber at her studio. I opened my eyes early, just before her. She was dead asleep and curled into a ball, her face a few inches from mine. She clutched her pillow with one clenched fist as if to hold on to her dreams. Her other hand unwarily lay flat on my chest, right over my heart. She was peaceful and beautiful. She truly looked like all the angels at once, altogether my heaven. That was the day I became fully aware of it, but I had probably loved her for a long time. I felt my heart swell and tears come to my eyes. I was relieved that she was in the land of Nod. Was it my male pride or my inability to reveal myself? The only way to be free from this emotion was to devour her, to taste her lips, to hold her, to get drunk on her skin and her scent.That morning was the first time I wanted to make love to her and show her how I felt without telling her anything. I drew near her little by little; my fingers brushed her short red hair behind her ear. I fondled the nape of her neck, so exquisite and perfect - the elegant and majestic nape that I adored. She calmly opened her eyes, and indulged under my kisses stroking her lush lips. My tongue found hers and subtly played with her.She caressed my torso, her hand running a course along my ribs. The sensation of her sculptor’s fingers touching me with sweetness and agility unleashed me. Why did the least of her moves linger in my head, when usually it was only the sex that I remembered? Sex with others was a basic and pleasant intercourse that only satisfied my primal instincts. Yet with her, at that instant, I took the time to memorize everything: her shiny steel gaze, her plump lips, her voluptuous curves, and her full and soft breasts. I leisurely tried to trigger a chill on her skin and a sigh from her mouth.She pulled me against her with her whole body, so intensely that my arms wanted to lock her in. I rose to the occasion, my cock swelling, and the pressure became almost unbearable. I was pointed between her legs; the friction between my hardness and her tender skin was almost excruciating yet so exhilarating.When I stroked her bottom, she set her thighs around me, arching into the small of my body. My penis freely rubbed her pussy already so wet for me. Her warmth drove me to shift myself over her, to get myself between her legs. And then I sought her eyes; I could have stared into her soul for an eternity. I was so keen to be in her, so in need that she liberated me, she took me away. I repositioned my pelvis to guide my length along her slit. I found my way unassisted, pulled in by her moistness. I penetrated languidly, stealing a moan from her. She closed her eyes and her long eyelashes reminded me of her sleeping face.I moved my hips in snakelike circles, dancing with her. Her body answered each of my pulses, rubbing and gripping my member in a velvet vice. Waves of pleasure fell through me and spread down my spine. She shivered underneath me.She opened her eyes again, gazing at me with longing. Her blissful face tensed in ecstasy. She was divine. She moaned sweetly, her voice nearly chanting, and this melodious sound mingled with the quiet shock of our bodies thumping together. My hands lay on her chest, the part of her that I believed to prefer, until I discovered, in a heartbeat, that I loved all of her and all of her parts without exception.Her orgasm overtook her, she unravelled, her inner walls vibrated and contracted around my shaft. When her eyes lit up and she cried out my name, I recognized that familiar feeling inside me again. I honestly wanted this moment to last forever. I wished her and her entire body to know how much I adored her. This emotion intensified tenfold when I exploded in my turn, pouring into her, my muscles stiffened with lust, nourished by her voice whispering for me to come for her.In the aftershock of this memory, I stood holding onto the pole in this train, my knuckles whitening, with an embarrassing bulge in the trouser department. Mercifully, the rain had me wearing a trench coat, or else I would look like a pervert harassing women in the underground. At least I could keep my dignity, but I almost missed my station.The sun set very early that evening; September pruned the days. I pottered along the pavement at a hasty pace. Images of her body flashed in my mind, pulling me to her. But an anxiety also punched me forward. I still had a fear of her infidelity, of her breaking up with me. I understood that my need to possess her was a rage which consumed me, and that the idea of losing her had become unhealthy. This was suffocating for her, but I still processed it. I had turned into a greedy, angry and insanely jealous man. This was a side of me that I hadn’t known before. I’d always thought of myself as an affable and gentle artist.Her presence next to me while I painted had changed my art. Gradually, light blended with my instinctively blue colours. From now on, it stressed out every brushstroke by adding profoundness and dimension. Silver tints modified its skin. My paintings became outright, as flamboyant as Anna-Lisa, but also stormy and passionate as my life. Her radiance inspired me, draped me and boosted me. But to my shame, I had failed to see how my darkness had reached her.The loft’s windows were dark, it seemed lifeless. A sort of premonition tied my stomach in knots. From the lift cage I could hear no sound, none of the music that would normally play from her iPod. I opened the door with my key and found a lifeless room bathed in the twilight. I called out:“Haven, I’m home. Anna-Lisa? ”Yet only my voice reverberated in the room. Everything was absolutely spic-and-span. The kitchen was immaculate. The bed was made up in its white sheets. Straight away I noticed that her black leather jacket was missing from the hat stand next to the door, and half of the rack that served as a dresser was empty. Her shoes were gone. My belongings were still in their spots on quite deserted shelves. I ran to the bathroom sink and opened the cabinet. All of her toiletries had vanished. Only my towels hung from the rails. Her fragrance still filled the space, hiding a curious smell of bleach, but her perfume bottle was gone. I knew what that meant, although I didn’t want to believe it. I began to wander like a fool in the apartment searching for traces of her: no more phone, computer or iPod. Some books had disappeared. The refrigerator was neat and sparsely filled. Her atelier was glossy and impeccable: her instruments were cleaned, my brushes displayed by size, her clay bags stacked and my paint cans aligned.An artist had lived here, but there were none of her sculptures, none of my paintings. All that remained was one piece of wood that had been covered with evidence of our sexual activities. In the middle of the bureau a final and unknown masterpiece was left: a fragment of a nose and a brow bone engraved in white mud. I recognized these traits; this flake of me was all that remained of us, of me.Anger and pain assaulted me and reduced me to a miserable wounded animal destroying everything in his path. I tore down the worktop which shattered, the cans spun on the wooden floor and clay flew out of disembowelled bags. I rambled like a robot among cut-in-two brushes, and red paint expelling on the floor. I collapsed against the wall, sitting slumped on the ground. I began to scream her name, yelling my agony until my voice faded out. I banged my head against the wall as if to come back to reality, out of this nightmare. But this was happening. She was gone, she had left me. And now, I was like the fragment of a portrait, broken and in tears.

Like an idol surrounded by an aura of light, her eyes shone. The metallic cobalt of her irises speared me like a sword and penetrated my mind. Her face above me was sublime. Her plush mouth trembled and burned. I was dying to kiss her, to taste her.Her naked body swayed on mine, wrapped in a soft beam. Each motion of her hips was leisurely and lithe. In silence, she waved. Little by little, she sought her pleasure. Her hands on my chest caressed my breastbone. I stared at her in silent appeal, so excited. I wanted to hold her, but she was already escaping me. She evaporated into the luminescence. Her skin sparkling from lust dissolved in the air.She tilted her head back, her face radiant. Ecstasy transformed her into a work of art, and she became divine. She shivered. She offered her heavy breasts to my mouth. Her backbone and butt swung in a slow rhythm. I shuddered. I knew that I was sliding into her; that I was filling her, but I felt absolutely nothing. Everything around us was blurry, and seemed off kilter.“Just for a moment, I beg you, stay; stay in this place, and let me be inside you, transcending in silence.”I was ready to give her anything and so much more. But suddenly, she disappeared and left me alone in a void.I surfaced with the sheets glued to my skin; I was soaked from perspiration, freezing cold. Looking up, I searched for her eyes, her face, her short crisp red hair… there was nothing but the textured concrete ceiling above me, echoing the emptiness.Last night I had fallen asleep longing desperately for her scent on the mattress. To my dismay, the sheets had been cleaned and held no trace of her. And today the rain dashed against the windows of her dark and deserted workshop. I was now fully awake and aware of everything around me. She was present in every object, in every nook and in every mote of air. At that moment, it seemed my body could feel her at last; I could sense the fire of her fingers on my skin and my heart beating for her. Yet I held nothing. The passion of my waking dream was hollow as a devouring absence. I was pinned by the hope of seeing her again, of touching her again. I needed her to fill the hole her absence had created. I should never have met her; never have been lulled into her arms; never have come in her. This emptiness should have been enough. If only I didn’t need hope to hold on to.She was gone, yet I couldn’t believe it. She should have stayed with me. She needed me as much as I needed her. I had to find her; I didn’t know what else to do. I dialled her phone number for what seemed the thousandth time. And as every time before, the message came back that her line was no longer in service. Next, I called Max who also hadn’t picked up for the last four days.After first discovering her abandoned loft, I had gone to his home. I found his new boyfriend, Roberto, but Max was out. I’d tried other ways to track her down. I had wandered the streets, redoing the path from Washington Square Park to the cafes she habitually frequented. I had interviewed all the bakers, waiters and grocers in the area. I had disturbed the neighbours to inquire about her, but no one had seen her. I had visited all the nearest hospitals and clinics, receiving no satisfactory answer. In the emergency room of Mount Sinai Hospital, I got so carried away, so maddened that I had been restrained to a bed and pumped with sedatives. The psychiatrist they sent to help hadn’t even listened to me. The disappearance of Anna-Lisa didn’t trouble anyone but me. The drugs had their proper effect, and sleep pulled me down for the first time in 36 hours. The next morning, I was forced to use all of my acting skills to persuade the head of the department to let me out.Determined to sniff her out, I had moved ahead with my investigation. Max’s latest unanswered calls made me imagine all sorts of theories, each one crazier than the next. Altogether paranoid, barely shaved, scrappy-haired, and dressed in the same crumpled and dirty outfit for three days, I showed up at the 9th Police Precinct. With my deathly pale face, and barely out of a psychiatric ward, I was taken for a nutter. My story had no credibility. Apparently, an adult woman could disappear whenever she wanted, especially if she lived with a mentally ill man. I was lucky not to end up in a cell after my visa was checked. Fortunately, Helene - my boss - pleaded my case. The cops tossed me out the door without another thought. Furthermore, of course, Max still hadn’t responded.I returned to the studio and called Helene to thank her. I told her I’d be away from work for a few more days. According to her, she didn’t know where Max was, and apparently she didn’t worry about him or about my ‘artistically moody lover.’This morning, after my sweaty wake-up surrounded by Anna-Lisa absence, I searched for clues, aching for any answer. I pulled open the drawers, the dressers and dug through boxes looking for any object, message, paper or photo that could help me. I rifled through every book, peeked in each album cover, each shoe, and every pocket. Aside from an old grocery receipt and a tube of lip balm, I found nothing of importance. In a hatbox, I found pictures of her childhood: a portrait of her parents, a dozen pics of a sweet little redhead with wavy hair next to a blond and smiley lad; and finally the same girl with the same boy, but he was pale and bald and in a hospital bed. Some snaps with Max, at parties, in their respective lofts or in the Hampton were also packed with other images, like a dollish young woman with long hair among Columbia students, in known places with a lot of unknown faces. No address book. No name. No phone number of any relatives or close friends.After turning the apartment upside down, I fetched my laptop. On Google, I searched for any information on her: gallery owners, museum curators who might have met her, artists whose paths she had crossed, but none had spoken to her for months. Desperate, I tried once more to reach Max, our only mutual friend, without any success as always.In the end, I decided to go to Max’s. I would wait for him until his came home, hours and days if necessary. Although seriously damaged and broken, I caught the underground in my trench coat, still damp from the constant rainfall of this past week. The sky was gloomy as the night threatened to settle. I rang and knocked on the door of my agent’s luxurious loft in downtown Manhattan until somebody showed up. My impatience paid up when Max’s boyfriend, obviously bothered, opened. I had dealt with him before, when I’d come on Monday also searching for Anna-Lisa. At that time, he had harshly replied in his Mexican accent that his partner was out of town. He had almost slammed the door in my face. But this time, I wasn’t going to let him dismiss me so easily, I barked and gave him short shrift to enter. Maybe he was frightened or felt sorry for me, or my foot popped in the doorframe may have defeated him, but he finally let me come in. The young Adonis with frizzy brown hair and a tanned complexion said that Max would return from his trip later in the evening and that I could wait for him in the living-room.At first, I refused to sit down so I paced impatiently in the main room. I mechanically cast about for traces of her in every familiar place. The stand where her sculpture “The Broken Woman” previously rested was empty, the masterpiece still exhibited at MOMA for her retrospective. She had also disappeared from Max’s home. Her absence was just as evident. The sofa where we formerly had tea was empty. The loft was quiet except the muffled sounds of Roberto talking on the phone in another room.My curiosity and my inability to remain in place pushed me to explore the apartment more thoroughly. I discreetly opened each door. I found a fully equipped gym in which the young talent was chatting, staring out the window with a towel around his neck. He eyed me dismissively before carrying on his conversation. Across the hall, a huge modern bedroom was furnished in dark grey and black decor. The walls were painted in a gradient of ivory and silver, an elegant and manly luxury. A couple of warm and cosy guest rooms done up in shades of beige lined the hallway. An oversized kitchen bordered an ostentatious dining room with its monumental crystal chandelier. A maid was busy at the sink; she greeted me respectfully. The final room to investigate was the library. I didn’t dare enter, yet it intrigued me. I was afraid that Anna-Lisa’s image would haunt me, that the memory of our first moment would overwhelm me. For a fraction of a second, a flashback revealed her leaning against the wood desk in her silky long black dress. Her naked nape and elegant bare back gave her a regal glow. She had a subtle fragility unveiling a supreme grace. The desire and the fascination I felt then was now replaced by an intense pain that took my breath away.In a corner of the library a series of paintings were set along a wall: mine. They were carefully marked and wrapped in paper. All the paintings I had created, so inspired by her presence at my side, while I thought she was working. To be honest, I had been blind to her distress. Apparently someone had brought my artworks to Max’s house on the day of her disappearance. Standing there like a prat, I was puzzled. I didn’t know whether I should feel relieved or explode in anger. Max - that bastard - knew where she was. He had to know. I was convinced, determined to wait and make him confess.Back in the living-room, a coffee had been left for me on the small table. I didn’t notice who had brought it. Eventually, I allowed myself to collapse on the sofa and simply wait. I drank my cup in one draught, and without noticing it, I slowly dozed off. Exhaustion was stronger than caffeine.After a while, I felt a hand on my shoulder shaking me delicately. A low voice called my name. I opened my lids, and picked out the suntanned, hairless head of Max. He glared at me. Behind him, Helene watched me anxiously, clad in her strict doyenne’s tailoring.“He looks really awful!” she said to her brother.“Tom, wake up!” he repeated.“Max! Where. Is. She?” I exclaimed loudly as I regained consciousness.This startled Max; and Helene gave me a look of such pity that made me feel miserable. My appearance was as tattered as when I’d been summarily dismissed from the police station. But she still didn’t register the state of my disrepair. I stared at them dazed as I sank deeper into the cushions. Later, in a calmer tone, I repeated my question.“Max, where is Anna-Lisa?”“I don’t know…” he said, stilted.Helene sat down beside me, and put her hand on mine. I withdrew it straight away. I didn’t trust them. My paintings in the library proved that Max knew the truth, and the presence of his sister made her suspicious as well.“I swear, Tom. My brother isn’t aware of her location.”“I don’t believe you. You know what happened. You went to her apartment, Max…”The agent drew closer the window, his gazed fixed onto the immensity of the city as if to escape my accusations.“I told you, I don’t know where she is… The last time I saw her, she was fine, but she wanted to get away. Since then, I’ve had no contact…”“You’re lying, it’s impossible!” I shouted.“And yet, it is true. She begged me to let her go, alone. She promised she would send me an email to give me some news. I finally accepted. I had no other choice. I’m her best friend… I knew she needed it, it was the only solution…”“Why?” I choked.“Because she is in the same condition as you!” he said, turning to face me.“He has a point. You look like crap, my darling Tom. How long has it been since you took a shower or ate a proper meal? You look like you’ve been living on the streets.”I knew that Helene was right. But the responsibility for that belonged to Anna-Lisa; it was her absence that brought me to this state.“Max, I love her… I need her… I don’t want her to be that way because of me…” I said with tears in my eyes.Sorrow and exhaustion collapsed in on me. I didn’t understand why she wanted to leave me. I couldn’t imagine living without her, and that she could have the strength live without me.“Tom, she just needs time. If you love her, you must give that to her. You don’t have any other choice. Be patient, take care of yourself and keep on at all costs. Do it for her!”  Max said, conclusively.“That’s the best advice. First, I suggest you wash up, eat something and sleep. Come to your office tomorrow and prepare your lectures; and try not to be alone. Now I’m going to bring you home.” said Helene.“Max, when she gets in touch with you, will you tell me? Will you tell me how she is doing, and where she is?”“If she’ll allow it, yes…”But I understood that the battle was lost. He would stay loyal to her.“I’m sorry, Tom…”I stood up and walked towards the door, passing by him. Helene rushed to kiss her brother, and ran after me. She led me quietly to her car in front of the building, where her chauffeur was waiting.My head resting against the window, I watched the illuminated streets of Manhattan until my block appeared at the corner of a boulevard. Helene rummaged through her handbag, and she eventually broke the silence as I opened the door to leave. She handed me a business card.“My brother will never tell you a thing. Listen. I know a very effective private detective: my husband … well, whatever. Call him and tell him I sent you.”I watched the limousine glide away, my fingers grasping a white rectangle of paper; my first glimmer of hope.

Sitting in the corner, I slowly stirred my spoon in a small cup of espresso. It was dark and strong, almost too bitter for my taste. Actually, I wasn’t completely there, seated alone at a table in front of my beverage and a half-eaten French croissant. I was more interested in the distraction coming from the usual customers, a bunch of locals who had their daily “petit noir” before starting their work. They talked about the same endless topics: politics or last night’s soccer game and the victory of PSG: the Paris St-German football team. By now, I was familiar to the bartender. But he left me alone, knowing I would only watch from my viewpoint in the corner.For the past few weeks my days were roundly repetitive. I had secretly moved into Max’s loft in Montmartre, in Paris. Once I left the hospital—where I had awakened altogether stoned, with a violent headache and a burning stomach—I’d refused to face anybody, especially Tom. I knew he wouldn’t understand and, most of all, I was absolutely ashamed of myself. I begged Max to leave me alone, to let me die. Again. Yet, he wouldn’t abandon me. He insisted on helping, and after many arguments, I finally convinced him to send me away to a safe place. He suggested his spare flat in Paris, on the condition that I’d have regular consultation with a psychologist at the American Hospital in Neuilly. I accepted because I would be as far away from Tom as possible, although also closer to his old country of England. I didn’t know what I was expecting. I only wanted to forget everything: to forget my shame, to forget him and my feelings for him. Apparently this wasn’t as easy as I thought.Every day I got up late in the morning, in Max’s small loft of “Impasse de la Cité du Midi.” He bought this flat in this little street years ago, for his future artistic career as a retired agent, but he never used it. It was set into an antique building that served as an old public bath during the Belle Epoque. The baths and showers of Pigalle were now transformed into luxurious lofts. It was a tiny flat with a bedroom and a cosy living room with a classic bay window. The kitchen was so narrow that you could barely move. You could only pivot to open the cabinets one by one. The bathroom wasn’t much larger, but the shower was functional.Everything from the boxy flat to the paved, thin blind alley decorated with vines, trees and flowers came across like the flawless bohemian life of Montmartre. The leaves had turned yellow to bright red. The dim light of the autumn sun played with the warm hues sparkling through the remaining drops of last night’s rain. The area was quiet and protected from the crowd. I had only to walk 50 meters to be surrounded by tourists going to the Moulin Rouge and, to eye with curiosity the displays of Boulevard Clichy’s sex shops.I wrapped my cardigan around me, pulled up the collar and started a brisk hike, head low, ignoring the crowd. I wandered by Le Chat Noir Cabaret and went straight back to my morning corner in Café des Deux Moulins, Amélie’s café on Rue Lepic. There, I only wanted to fit in and disappear. I killed time and didn’t talk to anybody, so nobody caught my American accent. I tried to memorize new French words, generally understanding half of the animated discussions.Usually, after an hour, I would leave the café and continue climbing Rue Lepic. When the weather was fair I’d turn left to keep on the long run ending by the Vineyards. The grape harvest was over, but the red leaves remained a spot of colour on the hill. Today, the clouds covered the City, like a gray and sad hat that locked the smog over the buildings. For the beginning of November, the temperature was mild; yet as usual, I wasn’t in the mood for a long stroll. So I went for the little tour, to change my mind, to stop reliving what I left behind. I was desperately trying to catch the artsy spirit of Montmartre, as Max recommended it. I wandered the paved streets, climbed countless stairs, crossed the Moulin de la Galette on top of the hill, and walked Rue des Abbesses to the old art nouveau Parisian subway station. I proceeded to the Cathedral Sacré-Coeur to find the entrance thronged by tourists. Normally, the view was breath-taking; you could see the Eiffel Tower and Notre-Dame, but today a thick fog hid the wonders of Paris. Although this all seemed familiar now, I still felt like a foreigner. I strolled around the basilica—such a pure and white monument—to arrive at Place du Tertre, where artists stood with their paintings. Why did I always need to go there? Was I trying to get my creative abilities back? Was I searching for a specific blue painting or the graceful gesture of its painter? I only hoped to feel something: urgency, lack, agony or even joy. I just felt numb.Some weeks ago I had wanted to die. I don’t even remember why, exactly. Nowadays, I was barely surviving. I used to feel pain, fear and love. But now, I was an empty vessel, just lost. My brain seems to have stopped working even though I was no longer under medication.Rue Norvin was packed with visitors buying souvenirs. I walked through, and then ran past residential buildings to end up in front of the remains of Bateau-Lavoir, a former shelter for artists. Picasso, Modigliani, Matisse, Cocteau, Gertrude Stein and Apollinaire were all regulars there, and would end their nights at the nearby cabarets. I imagined their souls still haunted the place and that they would give me back my inspiration.I was like a ship without a captain. I had run into a tempest, but the skipper was tired and dismissive. I drifted on a calm sea, too afraid to sail again. Maybe the boat was adrift a long time ago, even when Tom was the wind in my sails. I didn’t lift the spinnaker. I was too terrified to move on. I was accustomed to being my own captain and couldn’t share the rudder; so used to sailing alone and didn’t know how to take on a passenger.I was exhausted and incoherent. I longed to hide deep in the hull of this ship, my little borrowed loft in the center of Paris. I walked straight down Montmartre to re-join Boulevard de Clichy. In only one U-turn I was home, safe from the crowd and the fog. Perhaps sleep would quiet my thoughts, and I’d forget my absence of feelings.The red trees of La Cité du Midi didn’t cheer me up. I ran straight into the bedroom. I quickly threw off my clothes and put on the largest T-shirt ever. Then I pulled the curtain down and curled into the soft-feathered quilt. It was so quiet and peaceful; the only sound was my breathing. I couldn’t tell it if was comforting or not. I was lonely. I couldn’t recall anymore if loneliness was what I wanted, what I needed, when I had tried to end myself.But I did remember Tom, coming back to my New York loft after each day at work. He always showed up smiley, beaming with happiness and the wish to take care of me, only. He carried groceries or takeaways for our lunches. While he stocked the fridge and chatted about his day, I’d lay onto his back, surrounding him with my arms, resting my head against his shoulder blades. His tangerine smell and the warmth of his body were the only things I needed to be content. This connection was the simplest, and the most exclusive gesture I was able to demonstrate.In my Parisian bed, I tried to remember him, to feel him close once more.He used to turn back to me, to take me into his arms. He would move his face against my neck, holding me firmly. We would stay tangled tight until I’d inevitably feel gentle kisses behind my earlobe. He whispered I-love-you and I melted, every time.Now, with the tips of my fingers, I struggled to recall his kisses on my skin. My hands traced the course of his lips, the touch of his fingers when he peeled me out of my clothes.
In the middle of my Manhattan kitchen, goose bumps propelled on my body, in expectation. My inner thighs became pleasantly hot and I waited for him yearningly. I begged to have him inside of me. My fingers expertly unbuttoned his white shirt, and then pulled down his pants and boxer shorts. In no time we were naked, our hands wandering over each other. We kissed hungrily, teased intensely, set each other on fire. He grabbed my butt, squeezed and pulled me towards him, carried me to the kitchen table with his fierce and virile grip behind my thighs. My legs widened to encircle his waist, feeling the tip of his cock hard and high against my belly. Our lips were sealed together, but our hands wandered freely, caressing and holding. I stroked his length into my palm making him groan into my mouth. He slid a finger around my clit, drawing waves of desire so artistically.
Under the sheets, in my bed, my own fingers tried to reconnect me to the feelings he’d given me. My eyes were closed, my body heated, my legs spread to welcome the pleasure, to bring back the sensation of him.
On the kitchen table I sat pulling him to me, moaning and pleading for more, guiding his penis to my entrance. I already knew what that would do to me. I just craved for him to fill me, to be in me, to claim me; to make me cry. And feel. And live, because I was his. I was ready for him, only him, every day, at every moment. He entered me slowly, lingeringly. I felt every inch, like time had stood still. Then, we began to sway together, setting our own pace. Our movements went deeper and faster. We were frantically pleasing each other, giving and taking limitlessly. There was no discomfort; nothing was dirty. There were only the two of us—a couple in love—letting our bodies speak for us.
I remembered these moments, they were vivid and clear. I could imagine his cock throbbing against my inner walls, our orgasm building and flowing in our bodies. But here, alone, in this foreign house, my body felt nothing. My fingers couldn’t ease my ache and the need that continued in my core. I was bare and damaged. Frustration, rage and weakness washed over me. My tears poured down. I cried until I didn’t suffer anymore, until sleep came and plunged my mind into oblivion.***About four hours later, I was awakened by my growling stomach. I hadn’t eaten anything since my morning croissant. At least my body was still functioning a bit. A voicemail from my shrink reminded me of my evening plans. I didn’t really want to go, but I was trapped by my psychologist and her mysterious power over me. I decided to go out and eat a Kebab, as they were very common in the neighbourhood. I fed myself in the middle of the streets. The sun was setting down and the streets began to clear. The tourists abandoned La Butte Montmartre to leave space for the night costumers of the sex shops.My belly full, my head tucked into my coat, I was ready to climb up to the vineyard. I would visit the “Lapin Agile,” to the shop of a ceramist. My analyst urged me to participate in the training of pottery and traditional Montmartre ceramic. I was terrified to lay my hands on clay again, scared of what I might feel, or not feel at all. I was nervous to meet new people, of their eyes on me, of what I might tell them. But I decided to take the risk.I could barely catch my breath when I arrived at a private villa in Rue Paul Féval. I was in a major city, but this looked like a lovely countryside house. I was greeted by a charming elder couple, baba cool French artists. This was my first authentic interaction with a human being since I moved here. Actually, it was exactly what I needed. I instantly felt better, almost as if I could put my past behind and step back for a couple of hours.I was led to the basement, where a big pottery oven heated the whole space: an ancient wine cellar carved directly in the rock. The room was cosy and brightly illuminated with candles here and there. The couple offered us tea or red wine to warm us up. A wide old wooden table was based in the center, allowing twelve students to gather around. A pile of wet terracotta waited to be shaped by twelve pairs of hands.I settled at the table surrounded mainly by women, except for two men who sat together at one corner. They were probably friends, while everyone else was strangers. We were taught how to build a small bowl with the vintage and basic fencing technique. It wasn’t fresh to me, of course. It was a simple and fast way to assemble a piece. But I took my time, trying to mingle with the mud. My mind was sometimes caught in observing my fellow students. Obviously, some people were born artists or already knew this technique, while others were true beginners. Even so, everyone seemed to enjoy crafting. They all talked about sensations they had lost since their childhood.One of the two guys was a lot of fun. He joked about his clumsiness or about other’s bizarre skills. He was especially glad of the presence of so many women around him. He razzed each of us and teased me about my singular accent. He flirted with his neighbour in a cavalier French way, like a rooster in a hen house. Indeed, she didn’t mind and rather appreciated his sense of humour.The second man seated next to him didn’t pay attention to his friend’s acting. He concentrated and really tried to agglomerate his rolls of terracotta. He raised his left eyebrow and pointed his tongue between his lips. He looked like a child, in spite of a few grey hairs.Next to him, the first guy and the girl next to him managed to create goofy objects together. They started to erect a huge penis like chortling kids. The rest of the students mostly simpered or didn’t care at all. That was so typically French.“Yeh, l’Américaine ! Veux-tu en voir une Française ?” he asked, “Look at this French one!”It wasn’t the first time in the evening he teased me, but I pretended that I didn’t understand. He proudly showed his masterpiece, holding it up with one hand. When he thought it was stable enough, he released his grip and the terracotta inevitably curved and pointed down. His neighbour burst into laughter, but I didn’t join in.“Manu, leave her in peace, she is not in the mood!” His friend said in French. They looked at me and went on in English, “Don’t pay attention to him, he’s just a bampot.”Immediately I recognized an evident Scottish accent in his pronunciation of As and Os.“Oh, you are Scottish!”“Yes, I am! And you are American!” he laughed, “Who would have imagined two outlanders in such a weird place?” he said with emphasis on weird. “You seem to be having as much trouble as I, with your bowl.”Indeed, I hadn’t made anything, only a few long sausages of mud. Observing his work, I noticed an odd shape with edges and humps all around… well it wasn’t really round. At least it was standing upright.“Sorry, but I wouldn’t call yours a bowl. At least you finished it.” I joked.“Apparently, I am a master in abstraction. It’s a concept. That’s my style!” he giggled.He stood up to bring his piece to the pottery oven. He would return to find it baked within a week. Without thinking, in less than five minutes, I managed to build an impeccably shaped mortar. I should have been proud of myself. But, although the bowl was perfectly shaped, it was also perfectly pointless. I was the last to finish, carrying my creation to the oven while everyone else was putting on their coats.“Eh, the American! What’s your name?” he yelled before leaving.“Anna-Lisa”“I am James! See you next week, Anna-Lisa.”“Yes, see you. James.”Into the darkness, I walked back home, free and alone. For the first time, I didn’t think about a tall blond Englishman, but a salt and pepper Scotsman with nice sunny-blue eyes and a childish grin…

Chapter Notes

Let’s talk about James. After several weeks in Paris, I had to face it, I was thinking less of Tom as I was spending more time with Scott. He was friendly and light-hearted; moreover he possessed a peachy sense of humor. In just a few pottery sessions, I was amazed by how easy it was to be at his side. The bond we began to share was obvious. Nevertheless we had set a boundary that we took care not to cross. This border was actually welcomed. I found it safer.
   As the only English-speaking classmates, we started to get to know each other pretty quickly. I enjoyed spending time with him and his roommate Manu after sessions; we used to get drinks at a local bar. Manu had a tendency to be surrounded by many girls, so James felt relieved by my presence. We even met outside classes to have a stroll in different districts of Paris, so my promenades became vaster than Montmartre. We wandered through various parks, “les Tuileries,” “Le Jardin du Luxembourg,” we visited “St-Germain,” “Le Louvre,” “Le Marais” and “Versailles.” He turned into my personal tour guide.   During our long sightseeing we talked about our private life. James recently moved to Paris and settled with his old buddy Manu. They met when they were teenagers participating in a summer soccer camp. They were both promised a career as professional soccer players. I say “soccer,” but I’ve had to adopt the appropriate word of “Football,” pronouncing it in a chanting Scottish accent. Unfortunately, Manu was severely injured and he had to give up his dream, yet James held on. Not long ago, he was playing in the Scottish Football League as a defender for the Celtics. He never managed to become an international football star, nevertheless he teamed in the biggest club in Scotland, a huge accomplishment. Crushingly, his life was shaken and his plans collapsed following a major heartache.
   Unlike me, he flew away and found shelter in Paris. After ten years of a happy marriage, which gave him an angelic five-year-old boy, he had to deal with the usual reproaches, remoteness and resentment. He had to face his wife who found comfort in other arms. The treachery was too heavy to bear, so he left her, his son and his job to regain his senses. For three months he slept in Manu’s spare room, a Spartan and impersonal bedroom in Ménilmontant.
   Unemployed and alone in Paris, we obviously had more things in common than just a language. He stayed there, with nowhere to go, and tried to reboot his life with renewed motivation. He was the one who had been betrayed, when I was the one who betrayed myself, who betrayed Tom. My lover wasn’t another person, but a box of downers. I seriously flirted with death, and I don’t even remember why.
   Like James, I wished nothing had happened, but it was impossible. For both of us, the scar was forever gaping and festering. We couldn’t speak about it. Nevertheless we understood one another and didn’t push each other to talk. When we felt the need to confide, we spoke indirectly, though our confidant nodded and read between the lines. This complicity was a blessing. We were each others breath of fresh air, each others chance. Even if I was seeing a psychiatrist, I needed a true friend. We kept ourselves occupied.
   We could count on Manu to entertain us. He generally came with a silly plan to meet new people and tried to hook James up with a nice girl. Manu was nothing like a seducer, but his love life was kind of complicated. This allowed us to mock him.
   In a few pottery sessions, Manu managed to date his table neighbor Nathalie, while also seeing the girl next to me, a brunette named Christine. Of course, screwing around with two women, especially in the same group, wasn’t his smartest move. One evening, he created havoc where catfights and smashed ceramics ensued. Manu and his dates were banned. James kept on attending though, probably because of me. All of this could sounds comedic, in reality we knew that Manu’s behavior was hiding a lot of loneliness. After all he was like us, just seeking a partner.
   Tonight, Manu’s plan was a cooking course, an ideal place for a romantic meeting and people simply searching to savor life. Tired of being the wingman, James asked me to accompany them. His friend was somewhat happy that he might be paired with a total stranger during the class, rather than with his pal.
   Paris was busy in the evening, leading us to change metro in “Le Chatelet”. The whole world seemed to live underground here. Everybody was running in endless tunnels to catch a RER or the subway. Line one was crowded and we had to wait for two different trains just to go two stations away.
 Manu booked a workshop in an atelier and chose to learn how to prepare a French delight: the macaroons. The first lieutenant of Pierre Hermé, the famous French Chef, instructed the class.
   The kitchen was hidden in a little street across Paris’s “Hotel de Ville”. It was modern and convenient, and the mood was lickerish with the walls covered with chocolate-brown wooden panels. Six slate worktops fronted the main cooking ensemble dedicated to the Chef. Manu ended up being coupled with a voluptuous blond woman, and James and I were sat at the last worktable in the back.
   “How’re your cooking skills, Yankee?” asked James.
   “Non-existent!” I claimed.
   “You mean, like when you are making the most perfect round bowl ever?” He teased.
   “No comparison. I can literally burn down the house.”
   “Jeez! You aren’t the ideal housewife!”
   I laughed, yet he didn’t know how true that is. My cooking was lame, but my coupling skills were worse. Nevertheless, I didn’t want to think about that today. I was just hoping to surround myself with sweetness and dive into a sea of cocoa and a world of candies.
   Displayed in front of us we had almonds, sugar, eggs, cream, chocolate, spices, food coloring, butter, honey, fruits, and every other delicacy you could dream of. The first step was to prepare the trickiest part of the macaroons: the shell, a mixture of egg whites, sugar and almond powder. The Chef introduced us progressively to the secrets of the French meringues. A subtle blend was a matter of size: the finer and lighter the powders were, the more regular the shells would be. James was whipping the egg whites with an electric whisk while I was drizzling in the cloudy sugar powder.
   “I like cooking pastry,” he said with a joyful smile. “It reminds me when my grandmother used to bake on Saturday. I religiously licked the leftovers directly from the pot at the end.”
   “I cooked with my mom too, when I was little, while my brother and father played baseball in the backyard. She made the best pecan pie ever, with maple syrup and cinnamon. Occasionally, we baked together afterwards…”
   “You mean after your bro died?”
   I nodded. I didn’t recall that baking pies with my mother was a tradition that survived Jesse. I couldn’t tell if that was a way to be occupied or an attempt to maintain a link that was falling apart.
   “Do you miss your brother?” he asked.
   “Yes, I do. Sometimes I wondered what he would do or what he would have become.”
   “What about your parents?”
   “I don’t know. I guess I miss them too … and your grandmother, do you miss her?”
   “Yes, a lot. She raised me and she never saw what kind of man and father I grew into. I tried to bake with my lad as well. You know, Christmas biscuits. We usually left a mess in the kitchen, and my wife got upset. But my boy could always calm her down, looking at her with his puppy eyes. He’s a real charmer.”
   “Like father, like son!”
   He laughed, but a shadow passed through his irides and disappeared as fast as it came.
   We had to check our French meringue. Was it firm enough? The test was quite simple, turning the bowl of beaten egg whites over someone’s head. Of course, James chose me, and I ran from him. We were about to start a chase around the worktop, when the Chef scolded us as if we were turbulent kids. Mixing the almond and remaining sugar powder with the meringue wasn’t that evident. The meringue should break a little but must stay cottony. Currently, talking about our memories was complicated, so we chose to keep on working. Shaping the shells with a pastry bag required concentration. They needed to be fully round and all the same size. I noticed James sticking out his tongue and I tried to do an impression of him.
   “Yay! Those balls are perrrrfect!” I joked.
   “Nay! Yank! Beware of your sarcasm. We Scotts know how to and will hit back.”
   “Right! And I’m the twisted one!”
   Five minutes later, we were stuck behind the oven staring at the window like we were watching a movie. We were checking and encouraging the egg mixture to get nice golden colors, and be fairly bloated with a regular shape. My plate was forming well, but James’ burst into little mushroom-like bubbles. I was smirking ironically when his face became gloomy. He looked so miserable, that was really cute.
   “What did you say? You’re a master in abstraction!” I chuckled.
   “Yay! Freedom is the key!” he smiled.
   “Let’s see if you can create original ‘free’ flavors.” Declared the Chef  while passing by.
   He placed a hand on James’ shoulder and led him back to his spot, giving him an old whiskey bottle.
   “I found this old dame in the back of the kitchen, maybe you could make your own Scottish macaroons.” Suggested the Chef.
   James winked at me with a big bright smile. We served up a range of bowls with white-chocolate ganache in which we could have any spices or tastes we imagined. A drop of whiskey and bourbon vanilla would certainly make a fabulous stuffing for the Scottish delights. We had a lot of fun creating our blends. We were regularly spying on Manu and the lovely Blondie who were also being very playful. They both were greedily dipping their fingers in the rich mixtures suggestively. Manu was incorrigible.
   We concocted four different macaroons and decorated them with a piece of gold or silver foil on top. We were finishing licking the remaining of the whiskey vanilla cream, when Manu proposed to keep the night going in a wine bar in Montmartre. Being slightly tipsy, I couldn’t resist.
   As it was the 3rd Thursday of November, every restaurant was serving “Beaujolais nouveau”. This wine produced in the French region of Beaujolais was available just next its vinification. It was a tradition that filled all of the French pubs. “Au Rendez-Vous des Amis” was a typical bistro in “Rue Gabrielle.” Only a couple of glasses and we were all bursting into tears from laughing so hard. Manu was putting on a show, and his complicity with his old buddy was touching. James followed his jokes by adding juicy remarks. Their early football adventures were hilarious to listen to. During that evening I forgot everything. I was transported into another world where nothing from my past existed. Alcohol and good company were delectable antidotes, well I hoped so…
   Only ten minutes of walking separated me from my loft, but James insisted on escorting me in the middle of the night. A young woman alone in Parisian streets is not wise. We strolled down the hills using the interminable stairs. They still had their unique charm even on this cold November night, especially because we were quite intoxicated. We arrived totally frozen in front of my building. I couldn’t resist asking him to come in and have a coffee or a last drink. It wasn’t that innocent, I truly appreciated James. He was funny and kind of sexy. I felt relaxed with him.
   A bottle of whiskey and Russian vodka were hidden in the cupboard. We sat next to each other on the sofa, sipping our drinks and keeping up our joyful discussion. He was telling me silly stories about his time with the Celtics. He had read in a paper that eating pineapple could improve the taste of the sperm. This was already laughable, especially under the influence. However I cracked up when the whole team decided to snack on pineapple all day long, so half of them caught gastric problems due to the acidity. They lost the incoming match because of that stupid report. James, who was afraid of being blamed, threw the magazine into the toilets that consequently ran out of order. In conclusion, the coach suspended him for the following game.
   It was obvious that we were getting along pretty warmly and that didn’t bother either of us. We were slowly sinking into the couch. My head took place in the pocket of his shoulder and his arm contained me. Our laughs became feeble and our talks more intimate. I giggled lightly, catching his blue eyes. Little by little, as if this was the most natural thing in the world, we held hands and caressed each other wrists. I felt his sweet lips brushing my eyelashes and my nose, before carefully landing on my mouth. The sensation was very pleasant. I was crawling into his arms. His warm hands cradled me so tenderly. He kissed the corner of my mouth and licked my pulpy lips with the tip of his tongue so gingerly. We were suspended in that delicious moment when we ceased moving, understanding the impossibility of carrying on.
   “Sorry, I can’t…” he whispered.
   “No, I am sorry. It’s not you, it’s me…”
   “Listen. We both know. You still love him, don’t you? I might still love her too.”
   “Perhaps… But this is a mistake.” I said pointing us.
   “Yes. We might need it or want it, yet I would feel like I’m straying. She cheated on me first, I know, but it’s not the right payback.” He said, with sorrow in his eyes.
   “I suppose. I like that you are that kind of man—with honor and values. However, I don’t know how to forget Tom, even if I want to. I would enjoy keeping you as a friend.” I answered to comfort him.
   “I’m considering you as my best friend lately. I can tell you things I can’t even tell Manu.” He paused for a second and went on, “I received a letter from her, yesterday. It was the divorce papers and a strange handwritten note, a sort of ultimatum.”
   “I’m so sad for you. What did it reveal?” I cautiously asked.
   “She said that she’s nearly four months pregnant and she doesn’t know who’s the genitor. She will have an amniocentesis this week to check the health of the baby, and meanwhile she will do a paternity test. I might be the father.”
   His head drooped on the back of the sofa. He stared at the ceiling, and his tears flew down. I felt helpless and ashamed of my own little incoherent issues. I took his hand into mine and squeezed it firmly. For a while we talked about him, his wife, his fatherhood and feelings for his five-year son, that he missed him, that he might neglect a potential child. I let him sleep on the convertible and I went to bed in my room. I was just wrapped in a blanket when I heard heavy snoring on the other side of the door. Alcohol certainly pumped up the volume. He deserved to peacefully rest after so much pain.
   The day had been full of laughter and joy, but now was like every night, suffering and sobbing in my bed. As charming as this man could be, God, I craved Tom so much, his face when he slept and his adorable noises and snoring when he was deep into his dreams, serene as a baby. I also yearned for his gaze, the intensity when he looked at me and was able to make me surrender to his will. He owned me completely. He could make me do powerful and forbidden things because I needed to prove him that I belonged to him. I trusted him, I would have followed him to the edge, to my limit.
   I recalled when he stopped talking abruptly, and during this silence only one look, one soft smirk, or one suggestive gesture of his finger asking me to come closer, was enough to be under his command. He sat on a chair, his legs deployed on either side. His pants were already too tight for him as I walked in front of him and leaned against the kitchen table. I was too far for him to touch me. I knew what he expected. I could read his desire in his eyes. It was like an energy overflowing from his body. Gradually, I peeled my clothes off, one by one, throwing them in his direction. He caught every article in his hands. His glanced never moved, it was fixed on me. He didn’t smile, his jaws were locked, so serious, but his chest was breathing heavily. He grabbed my wet panties, smelling them, scraping the silk between his fingers.
   I stood naked in front of him expecting a movement, a sign. He fondled me with his eyes as he whispered between his teeth:
   “Caress yourself. Show me where you want to be touched. How you want to be pleased.”
   I closed my eyes and rub my breasts with the tips of my fingers, languidly brushing the soft skin until my nipples reacted. My hands wandered down, causing goosebumps.
   “Keep your eyes open, Heaven, look at me.” He ordered, “Sit on the table, right there on the edge. Show me how much you want me.”
   I obeyed without contradicting him. Yes, I burned for him, although I wanted that moment of pure surrender even more. I could feel my pussy pulsating, needing what I was about to do, wishing to listen to his low voice guiding me. I spread my legs, laying my feet on the chairs next to me as I waited…
   “Heaven, you are so beautiful. Keep on touching yourself until you cum, for me.”
   A bulge was pressuring his crotch. I could clearly see the outline of his cock under the fabric. He fidgeted enough to free himself from the strain in a short instant. However, he continued to scan me, enveloping me entirely in his will. How could he stay so earnest?
   One of my hands caressed my thighs, moving up to my center. The other cupped my breast. With two fingers, I started to rub my clitoris gently. Only a little curl and I was moaning, so close.
   “Cum for me, Heaven.” He sighed, “I know that you ache for it, that you yearn for me.”
   My hand lingered on my pussy, stirring and drawing tantalizing circles, faster and faster, my fingers sliding from my slit to my swollen button. I saw his mouth pinch as tension grew in him, and my orgasm rushed on me, hard, my vagina tightened in successive waves. He moaned and licked his lips from this view.That was so dirty, but so wonderful. I stared at him satisfied of the effect I had on him.
   “Come closer.” He ordered his eyes shinier than ever.
   He didn’t need to ask twice. I was on my knees unbuttoning his jeans within no time. His cocked popped out of his fly, long and hard, pointing in the air.
   “Just wait, Heaven. I want you on your fourth and holding on for me.”
   He stood up in front of me and pushed the chair away. I then saw my reflection into the tall bathroom mirror. He wholly undressed. I checked him out, agonizing desperately to have his cock in my mouth, his cock that was just there above me, almost in reach. He moved behind me and I contemplated him bowing down on his knees.
   “Spread your legs wider, Heaven.” He whispered into my ears.
   I could feel his body leaning on my back, his thighs between mine, and his length between my butt cheeks gliding forward to my wet pussy. He found his balance, on one hand to my right, and enclosed his left arm around my breasts, clamping my nipples. My body fit perfectly under him, our reflection was exquisite and exciting.
   Suddenly he plunged his cock into me, deep. I pleaded for more at the first stroke.
   “God, you feel so wet, so smooth. Heaven you are mine.”
   “Yes, Tom. Oh yes!” I wept.
   Again, he pushed in harder and pulled me even closer to him. He kissed my nape hungrily. My fingers entwined with his on the floor. He rubbed his body against my back with every shove. The ecstasy built sharply in me, deep in me. His stiff cock pounded into me while he intensified the pace. He smelled like sex, tangerine, and spices. His teeth clamped down on my shoulder as I cried out my pleasure loudly. I noticed in the mirror that his jaws tensed as his was forcing his way between my inner walls that clenched around him with undulation. He plunged into me over and over before he poured his wet warmth in me, his breath stopped as he roared. We both cried when I reached another orgasm, even stronger than the one I just received.
   He surrounded me with his arms and held me against him as he sat up on his heels. I was still impaled by his member. I needed more and I began to sway my hips. As he watched us in the mirror, he whispered into my ear once more:
 “Oh Heaven, I love you so much.”
   The loud snoring behind the door broke my memory. I realized that despite my recollections being vivid, I didn’t feel anything. I was just empty, frustrated, and alone. The handsome guy next door wasn’t whom I needed. I swept my tears away, and I called upon sleep.***
   In the following morning, I had no way of knowing that somewhere in the Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport, Tom was standing across the border with his English passport in hand. Max was still in the wait line, reserved for the non-European citizens… To be continued…

TOMAll the hard work I did these past few years was beginning to pay back. Every one of my expectations was becoming a reality. In just a few months, Max revealed himself as an exceptional agent, and my career as a painter launched in no time. I attended countless meetings with journalists, gallery owners, and prestigious art collectors. Helen hired an assistant for me so I could keep teaching in Columbia and take days off for my promotion as the promising new talent in the New-York art world. Max brought me to every event where he was chuffed to introduce me. He was also excited that I was successful. I grew to be charming and easy-going, even though my beard had grown back and I hadn’t gotten a proper haircut in ages.In only two months, I was offered many interesting opportunities to put on an exhibition. Max didn’t rush to accept the earliest proposition. He waited a bit until he accepted the most incredible proposal ever. The Pompidou Centre in Paris would endorse a contemporary artist who had never been exposed before in “L’Espace 315” for the first time. This room was reserved for the younger generation of international artists. This was a tremendous honour. I was fully aware of my luck. So far, Max had created a buzz around me and only professionals were allowed to see my painting. The critics were unanimous when it came to predicting my dazzling career. The public would admire my work at Beaubourg for the first time ever.All of this hustle and bustle, the meetings, and the conception of the exposition kept me busy for the entire autumn. I didn’t save any time for me or for strolling in Manhattan Streets and enjoying the colour and the legendary mood of New York at this season. I was thankful to be overbooked and I tried to savour my activities, to experience every moment as a true exhilarating gift. I hoped to be quite occupied so I would feel less empty, less lonely. I had no one to share those moments with. I never stopped thinking about Anna-Lisa for one second, but I just pretended that I didn't My career was bliss, but my love life was a disaster.I recruited Helen’s private detective, but he turned up as bodger. He found nothing on her whereabouts. I ceased to pay him as soon as I perceived his pointlessness. I could only wait for Max to inform me if anything awful happened.Nonetheless, Max didn’t buy my false easiness about her disappearance. He was the first person who discovered my paintings. He could tell that my art became sadder and darker. My radiant blues were converted into gloomier shades. I added a lot of black and some green furies, like a mischievous glow, mysterious and threatening. I ended up portraying every emotion, from the purest and most joyful to the deepest and most tormented ones with the same intensity. This palette was described as captivating and exhaustive.Here I am now, in Paris, the city of lovers, for one week. Max and I spent days nailing the last details of the show. On Saturday, I was the main attraction of the opening night. Journalists were welcomed to the party. Max took care to invite both of my parents, their current partners, and my sisters with their families. That evening certainly was the most rewarding instant of my life. It felt wonderful to have my beloved ones around me. They shared my success, and I was moved by their pride. My very intuitive mother sensed that something was wrong. In the middle of that crowd I couldn’t confide her that the woman of my life had gone missing. Could she see the adverts about my show in papers? Did she watch my interviews on TV? Would she come and visit? I had no idea. I only hoped this could reach her because she was in each creation. My feelings for her perspired out of every canvas, every trace of my brush.Max sold all the pictures and filled an order list to keep me occupied for the whole year. So overall, I had a gratifying evening and made the most of each minute.Today was my final day in Paris. I choose to spend it at Beaubourg, and not in the city. What is the point at walking the Champs-Elysée alone? I hide myself among visitors and listen to their comments. I was kind of surprised about them. I expected people to hate my art, remain silent, or not comprehend it. However they all expressed something relevant. They were each touched in the most peculiar way, everyone by a specific aspect that spoke to their personality. It was striking to learn the secret power I had. I was so overwhelmed. This was amazing! I was flying high until I hit the ground loud and clear. A guest compared my work with Anna-Lisa’s sculptures. They had got parallel vivid emotions. I received this remark as a dagger in the heart.Then Max and I ordered a drink at the restaurant George to spare the remaining hours in Paris before our flight back. From our table set on the terrace we admired the view of the Parisian roofs. Dismally, we were interrupted by the rain which started to come down like cats and dogs. We passed some time in the museum art library and two shops: the first on the ground floor and the second on the balcony. From this promontory, I could look at the viewers while Max bought a vase for his sister. The rain brought more visitors, and the main lobby was becoming packed. I observed the people who exited “L’Espace 315” and tried to decipher their thoughts about what they had seen.There, I saw her! She appeared like a ghost, like a mirage in the desert, somewhat unexpected. Yet, she was real, she was here. Her ginger hair was unkempt and longer, but her creamy skin and her sharp blue eyes sparkled even in the distance. She came across as gaunt, and mirthless. I wanted to scream and run to her, when I noticed him. A man was talking to her at her side. She answered drawing intriguing signs in the air. Her gesture had always been so graceful and fluid. With this guy, she seemed accomplice and concentrated on her topic. My knuckles tightened and bleached on the balcony fence, and I felt swallowed by the enormous space, the outlines of the concrete architecture went blurred. My heart and breathing stopped and I thought I was falling.Max brought me back as he put a hand on my shoulder.“Darling, leave her where she is!” he said.“No, Max, I can’t.” I shouted and started to run toward the exit.I heard him mumble a “Jeez!” I reached the escalator, pushed people on the edge to make way, and leapt down the stairs. I chased the couple who went outside under the rain. When I managed to stand at the bottom of Beaubourg Esplanade, I was only able to see a layer of umbrellas crossing each other path randomly. No sign of her, but she must be there. I screamed her name desperately, but no one paid attention other than some surprised people near me.Max overtook me and pulled me closer to the wall under the external corridor to find shelter.“She is in Paris, she has been all along. But I couldn’t tell you. I expected her to come to your opening yesterday, so you could talk, make peace… Well, I don’t know what I really expected. I’m sorry Tom.” said a pitiful Max.“Who is this guy?” I asked angrily. I didn’t mind Max’s lies and secrets. I could only picture them, her with another man. I was burning and devastated inside.“I have no idea. She doesn’t talk to me. I barely receive news. He’s probably just a friend. I am sure she is still in love with you. Just let her go! Give her time.”“How could you even know if she stays silent!” I yelled at him.“Because she wrote it!”Max took an envelope out of his jacket and handed it to me.“It’s addressed to me!” I noted.“Yes. She left it before leaving, but I couldn’t give it to you. I was afraid you would be destroyed too, that you would try to commit irrevocable things. So if you love her, please let her go!” cried Max, “I only wished to protect both of you.”I didn’t understand anything. Max forced me to read the letter. 
“My Gorgeous Tom,

 At that moment, facing this white page, I still don’t know how to express myself. I am lost. I don’t know who I am or where I stand. I don’t remember how to have a coherent thought anymore. I don’t know how you could understand this.

 The only thing I am sure of is my love for you. I love your body and soul. I crave you. I am mad about you.

 But this love is consuming me. It’s killing me. And I know I might hurt you back. I might even kill you. I will lose you as I lost my mind and my ability to create.

 I hoped you could save me. I clung on to you like a fool, but how could you rescue me when I can’t help myself?

 Nowadays, I am incapable to live with you and incapable to live without you. Now, I will set you free. I am leaving this world…

 Please forgive me. I’ll love you endlessly!

 Anna-Lisa.”
 I hold these few words in my shaking hands. I couldn’t believe what I had just read. I wasn’t able to process this. How was I supposed to react? Do I have to cry, to shout, to be angry, to panic, to run after her?“Max, what does it mean?” I asked baffled.“On the day she disappeared, I found her lying unconscious on her bed. She had ingested a bottle of pills. I immediately called an ambulance. Later, I discovered this message for you.”“Why didn’t you tell me? Why did you hide her? Why did you hide this from me?” I cried out.“I didn’t know what to do. I was scared. Maybe I even was a bit jealous and angry. At first I held you responsible. She wrote you a message, but nothing for me. She tried to kill herself because she fell in love with you. I wanted to punish you. Nevertheless, I finally figured out that you weren’t the problem. She needed help. She needed to go away and find her own way back. Now, if this way leads back to you, so be it. You are two marvelous people, and you deserve to be happy. I guess her path is just more tortuous than yours.”“Oh Max, I often sensed that something was going wrong. I tried so many times to figure out what it was, why she was so fragile. I attempted to reach her, to fix her. But she never let me come near her.”“I know her enough to say that she wanted you to be close, but she simply didn’t learn how to.”“Max, she is not dead! What is she doing?”“She lives in Paris, I lend her a small flat I own in Montmartre. I take care of her in distance. She goes to see a therapist I recommended, and I make sure she doesn’t miss any appointments.”“That’s good. But who is the lad who was with her today?”“I told you before, I honestly don’t know. I think he’s just a recent acquaintance.”I looked into my agent’s eyes. I saw his sadness, his worries. Every feeling for her was carved into his feature. He suffered so much for her and had to notice her destroying herself, partly because of me. Those emotions stabbed me. I ached to witness his pain, I ached imagining her suffering so deeply that she wanted to die. I wished I could run to her, hold her in my arms and soothe her. I would tell her I love her and everything would be fine from now on. It wasn’t a good idea though. Max was right, she needed time. I was powerless. It was painful to only have hope to rely on. It hurt to realize it might be already too late, that she might have found comfort into someone else.“OK Max, let’s go and catch our plane.” I said.Max gently patted me on the back.“I am so sorry, Darling…” he answered.Just like that, in a fraction of time, I decided to let her go, because I understood that was the best thing to do and because I loved her enough to let her live, enough to free her. *** We were above the Ocean, and everybody was resting during the night fly to New York. I was the only one awake. I used to sleep like a baby on planes, but not that night. The thought of Anna-Lisa and that man going out of my exhibition was haunting me.Did he make her smile with her whole face like when we had danced in the streets of NYC? Is he capable of making that little frown of tension disappear? Did he know how she drank her coffee, how she ate a Danish roll patiently so her pleasure could last? Did he tell her how much he loved her by laying his forehead on hers? Did he show her what she meant to him, how much he craved her, that he wanted her soul, her heart, and her body? Did he communicate with her in silence? Did he get her troubles, her fears? Could he soothe her just with the warmth of his body? Did he trigger goosebumps on her skin when he grazed her hands? Was he able to make her melt each time he whispered into her ears? Did he provoke a moan when he kissed her neck? Could he dissolve her in his arms when he held her? Did he know that she liked to be tenderly kissed, only lips brushing, their tongues slowly twining into a more passionate kiss? Was he able to make her wet, just with a look and a smirk saying that he wanted more, that he loved her? Did he caress her breasts softly, delicately before she pleaded for more, before he sucked it, nibbled it, until she dug her nails into his hair? Did he discover that unique point, this muscle near her belly button, this nerve that reacted to a simple touch launching her skin into quills that breezed under his finger? Did he cause her eyelids closed and her head switched back when he clamped her hips and pressed his erection against her thighs? Did he make her stop breathing every time he slid the palm of his hand between her legs? Could he claim her with his fingers fondling her nape?I was dying imagining her with him, that she let somebody else get so close to her. I knew I was the only man who made her cry for pleasure the way she did. Only “I” understood which button to push, how much pressure to apply to turn her into a beggar who needed me to please her with one finger between her legs, me to tease her pussy, and me to torture her until she came, until she circled me in her arms and hurriedly undressed me. God, I remembered her dark blue eyes misted with devotion which memorized each of my muscles, each of my freckles, like she owned me, and she did! She climbed on me, pressing her breasts against my torso. She grabbed my butt pulling me avidly against her, her leg around my waist and her heal in my back. I knew how wet and ready she was. How she was agonizing to have me taking the lead. She would surrender to me. She would let me penetrate her, body and soul. I made each push expressing what I felt: passion, desire, and worship. My whole body lived for her, vibrated for her. I was telling her all this with my hands, my eyes, my lips, and my cock. Every deep caress was a blessing we shared. Her heat and her tight inner muscles jailed me in her. Each of our moans was an “I love you,” each of our cries was a “you are mine, I am yours.” Her sweet smell, a mesmerizing fragrance of sex and lust, used to drive me into oblivion. She was the only one, during every heartbeat of this connection, and even after.Our ecstasy was the most compelling force on Earth. It was stronger than winning a battle. It was mightier than any war. It wasn’t just pleasure, it was a communion, a celebration, a promise of eternal love. The aftermath was the most dovelike prayer in Heaven. It was more precious than a childhood memory. It was more delicate than any dream.She was mine, she couldn’t be his in anyway. I knew I had tainted her for every other man. I didn’t take any pride. I was terribly sorry and low. I had to let her go, but would she ever be free? I had to do that for her, because I loved her, yet my heart was about to stop beating. I ached, but I couldn’t help to keep hoping…Him … he could go to hell!

Anna-Lisa
Christmas decorations started to infuse the window shops and the streets. Paris city hall was generous with their amount of ornaments. Every avenue was sumptuously illuminated with modern strings of fairy lights between each tree and building. The vibe was magical. The “Boulevard Clichy” wasn’t outdone. My neighbor, in our little impasse, started to bring to life their windows and porches with Merry Christmas accessories. The colors of autumn were long gone and the winter’s shades, darker and cooler, needed to be perked up.Those grey colors should have shown my latest mood, but for the first time in a while I was feeling light. It was even probably the first moment in my life that I let myself be infected by the holiday spirit. Something happened that transformed me. Yet, I wasn’t conscious of it until that moment. I didn’t know the precise event that turned me, but I could remember when it started.It happened on a rainy Sunday afternoon, on the last weekend of November. I was visiting the “Beaubourg Museum” with James. Since our “almost” romantic night, our relationship had changed. We spent more time together as real friends. That day, I had the courage to see Tom’s exhibition. I surprisingly noticed he was invited to expose there. I was so proud of him. In the meantime, I was seriously frightened to have a look at his art, so I hesitated to enter. James's presence comforted me and he stayed close to me in silence while I lived through Tom’s paintings—a hell of an emotional ride. There’s no word to describe my feelings. I was happy and sad, excited and hurt. As soon as we came out of “L’Espace 315”, James grounded me with his canny comments on the paintings. With his subtle kindness, he allowed me to express myself without pushing. I recalled trying to tell him before about me and Tom, but I couldn’t give the whole truth, my deepest secrets. I was expecting he would find out without unveiling me. I was starting to comprehend that, I also realized that I acted the same way with Tom.James and I spent the rest of Sunday and most of the night together. Finally, I told him everything about my love story, my childhood, my lack of creativity, my angst, and my hopes. He listened scrupulously. We talked as well about his situation, his wife and his own expectations. Once more, he slept—and snored—on my sofa. I went to bed peacefully with the sensation of having a brother in the nearest room. I wasn’t alone anymore.On the next day, I consulted my therapist and she aided me in understanding a few things. I never thought that a stranger would be able to help me out. My artwork has always been my only cure. Right after my appointment I opened the clay bags that Max bought and hid in the closet. It wasn’t my usual material, but the same kind of terracotta we worked at my pottery class, a sort of porcelain, white, delicate and ready to be used. When I experienced it under my fingers, I felt its sweetness. I remembered how to mold, to carve, to mix, and to build structures. The gestures were natural and so releasing.For three days, I practically locked myself up in Max’s loft. Once my first sculpture was finished, I wrapped it in a towel, put it into a box, and walked straight to the villa of my hippie pottery teachers. These friendly freewheelers were so eager to lend me their oven that they left me a key. Then, I repeated the same ritual with the next workpiece. While a sculpture was baking, I shaped another one at home. I fed myself with only milk and kornflex® at any hours of the day, and I napped mostly on the sofa, rarely in my bed.When the doorbell rang, my hands were dirty. My clothes were dusted with dry white clay and I had mud in my hair and behind my ears. I opened the door with my elbow to let James come in with cups of coffee and cinnamon rolls from the Starbucks of “Place Clichy.”“Good morning, Yankee! Are you repainting the walls?” he pointed to my stained T-shirt.I grabbed the mug and rushed hungrily towards the Danish rolls as he teased.“You’re Welcome!”“Thank you!” I mumbled with my mouthful and grinned.He wandered slowly into the apartment. And in the atelier behind the canopy windows set in the living room, he noticed the worktop loaded with masterpieces. I was very productive. The sculptures were mainly small in size, but the shapes were innovative, more abstract and adventurous as I became used to sculpting. Their energy was palpable, as they seemed to be in perpetual movement. My pure and delicate style created lighter specimens, coupled with a revived strength.“Wow, they’re amazing! I like them. I see you didn’t stay quiet.”I grinned, “Oh thank you. It’s a first attempt. Some deserve to get bigger. I have tons of ideas to use new materials.”He sat on the sofa and I jumped next to him and sat cross-legged, my bare feet under my thighs. I glanced at the brown paper bag and saw that there was only one cinnamon roll left.“Hey! That’s mine,” shouted James.“Oh sorry. I’m starving. I didn’t eat anything of substance for a while. Maybe I should order Chinese.”“Anna-Lisa!” He laughed, “It’s 10 in the morning.”“Oh Jeez, I lost perception of time.”I peered at him with puppy eyes and he conceded.“OK, you can have mine, greedy girl.”I shoveled a large bite of the roll into my mouth and licked my sticky fingers, even though they were disgustingly mixed with clay.“It’s great to see that you enjoyed yourself a little. You didn’t seem alive lately, so I am glad to witness you murdering this roll with so much haste.”“Those are delicious!”I tried to articulate while eating. I finished the last pastry in less than a minute.“Well, James, you probably didn’t come to feed me or accuse me of a filthy crime. What brought you here?”“Actually, I need your help. My wife sent me the results of the paternity test and I don’t want to be alone.”“How does it sound?”He held me a sealed envelope.“I don’t know, I haven’t opened it yet.”“I get the picture! Do you have any idea what the outcome might be?”“No, not any. Apparently we have the same probability to be the genitor.”“What has the other guy said?”“This knobhead! He gave her two choices, either she’ll get an abortion or he’ll leave her and won’t have anything to do with the baby. I guess he’s praying that I am the father.”“Nice! And you, what do you wish?”“I don’t know.” He answered stroking his face with his hands.“Let me summarize the situation,” I spoke warily, “On one side, you could let her raise the baby alone, like a single mother who already takes care of your son. You could let her juggle two kids and a job, while you stay here living the high life with Manu in Paris. Which means, sleeping in a tiny impersonal room listening to your buddy’s sexual feats with the blonde from the cooking class through the paper thin walls.”“Presented like that, you don’t give me a lot of alternatives. And frankly, I never saw Manu as hooked by a girl. It might be the one. Perhaps, it’s the moment to let them have a bit an intimacy.”“Well, I may have tainted the situation in black a little. Your second choice might not be that easy either. You go to your wife. And start to forgive each other. You forget what happened and raise the baby. You could ask for help, try couples therapy and rebuild a home. I know you miss both of them. She is evidently not shutting the door. Do you believe you could do that?”“I think so…”“James? Don’t tell me that’s not what you really want, what’s your heart calls you to do.”He paused and declared, “Yes, of course, it is!”“If this letter reveals that this baby isn’t yours, will that change anything?”“No … no, I truly want my family back and I would be glad to welcome a newborn with it.”“That’s what I guessed. Now, should I open the envelope or will you?”“Give me this damn test!”He caught the letter and stared at me. Defiant, he tore the paper into little confetti. I lift my coffee up and exclaimed.“Congratulations, Daddy! Today we should plan a proper party to celebrate your brand new life before you leave Paris.”“Hey, Yankee! I am not leaving this city without you!”“No way! I won’t go to England with you!” I claimed shocked.“Of course not!” He chortled, “Your presence won’t help me to reunite with my wife! However, I am serious, you are going home too. You are going back to New York.”He had a fair point. At one time I would have to make a decision. When James wouldn’t be in Paris anymore, I would be alone again. This idea was totally scary and, I wasn’t ready to admit it.“I don’t know.” I said looking away.“You are very intuitive about the others, but about you, you have progress to make. Maybe you should start to whoop it up. You are merely contemplating while your own life goes by, like a simple spectator. Perhaps you should stop being afraid and travel back to Tom, because you still love him.”“How could you be so sure?”“It’s so obvious. Look at your sculpture,” he giggled and walked into my atelier. “Look at those, can’t you see? Every creation is a mirror of one of his paintings. It’s the same movement, the same depth. You echoed each of them. If you bring those to the Pompidou center and they display them aside his canvas, they will just fit. It’s incredible that you aren’t even aware of this.”“James, it’s too late… What I have done makes a return impossible.”“Maybe not. You should talk to him and explain him everything you mentioned about your anxiety, about your family, and you. Tell him you loved him and you forever do. That you were scared and that you still are. But give him a chance. You have to live for yourself, for him. You have too much positive stuff to offer, so much love to share. I am going to build a new family, anyhow you should begin to create one for you, with Tom, and even your agent Max. From now on, don’t forget that you are loved and that you have a family abroad. You will have to visit your godson.”“My goddaughter!” I joked and push him with my shoulder. “I’ll think about it. That’s all I can promise for now.”“You’d better, because I am going to buy bottles of champagne that we’ll drink for our goodbye party.”I wasn’t sure about my decision yet, although I motivated him to plan this future reception. I needed to keep him talking lightly and delay the moment when I will be lonely again.***A few hours later, the sun was already down. The warm light of the Christmas fuzz formed a reassuring glow on the walls. I woke up on the sofa wrapped like an imperial nem into a blanket. James left a note on the coffee table.
“Hello Yankee, 

 I filled your fridge with some food. I bought my Eurostar ticket to London and called my wife. She’s waiting for me this weekend. I will talk to you later! 

 XOXO

 James”
I couldn’t help smiling. However, I only needed to weep. I just had the most vivid dream. Every impression remained alive in my cells. Each emotion swirled like waves on me, one after the other, and left me to drown. They were powerful. I finally burst into tears, tired and unbelieving. It wasn’t just a dream, but a memory of me, living and breathing in Tom’s arms, feeling everything over.First it came as a mist and, music lost faraway in my mind. Little by little, I was able to hear him. I recognize his low voice whispering my favorite song— “My Funny Valentine”—into my ears. His deep tone was mesmerizing. I registered his warmth surrounding me. His body heat was soothing. In his arms I sensed peace. I surrendered.We were dancing in my loft. The sunset lights of New York irradiated a sweet orange and pinky shade. The outlines of things were blurred. My nose leaned on his neck and filled itself with his joyful fragrance. He smelled like cinnamon, tangerine, and wood. I started to be hungry for him and I knew that in less than no time I would be greedy and savage. However I remained close to him, my breasts against his chest, my hands around his shoulders, and my lips brushing the skin of his neck. I tasted this vein, the one that appeared every time he was taut. I could feel this tension, an excitation growing into his cells. His burning impatience was an unimaginable stamina. I could live internally as long as this spunkiness solaced my mind.We swayed tenderly, suspended in time. I was treasured and so was he. Our hands started to prove it. Our kisses caused pleasure and need. We wanted more. I perceived that my body missed his. That an absence, a void, was pleading to be filled. I ached for him. He gradually began to undress me. He peeled the straps of my tank top on the side, each motion was followed by licks on my skin. His touch was like a feather. His kisses were like rain drops. I felt fever and quills. I moaned his name, breaking the silence left after the end of our song. He gently lowered me on the mattress, cupping my face with his hand. He bent and searched for something in my eyes. The flat was getting darker. His piercing cerulean eyes were my anchors. He must have found desire in my gaze because he shifted to stand up at the end of the bed and removed his T-shirt and pants. He played a tantalizing game. I lay motionless and scanned his phenomenal silhouette, his muscles chiseled into marble, his V-line of a Greek statue, his Apollo’s arms and his long and endless athletic legs. I was proud—proud to be with this man; so beautiful, so adorable, and smart. He loved me. I was stunned but so light-hearted. Viewing him quickly created lust. Hotness invaded my body. My muscles tightened with need. I desired him so intensely that nothing else existed. The way he watched me with gluttony, with an indescribable urgency, made me angry. Because he wasn’t there with me yet, he wasn’t touching me, kissing me, penetrating me. I pleaded him silently with my entire body. He could read my soul so he was aware of it.He knelt between my legs, caressed my thighs, brushed his fingers on my soaked lace panties. He pulled them off. I discerned the fresh air breezing on my pussy. I felt unveiled, revealed. He embraced my waist and lifted me to rest on his lap.Entwined closely into each other we found our speed sitting together. We encircled our legs, our arms around us, holding tightly to each other. We lived and breathed for each other like we were the only soul in the world. This connection was obvious and unbreakable. This moment was just made for us, for this ultimate passion, for our perfect love. We knew our orgasm would explode and throw our feeling around us, which would mean that our bodies would have to be separated. So, we made it last as long as we could.The silence gave room for another kind of music: moans, whispered names and I-love-you, the clapping of my butt on his balls and, the wet sounds of his length sliding in me. His cock repetitively pounded my G-point. My inner walls squeezed and fully enfolded him. Our bodies tensed as we felt ecstasy. We cried and our voices echoed in the loft until silence took place letting our halting breath calm down.A moment after, lying into the pocket of his shoulder, my fingers played with his chest hair, my nostrils inhaled his intense smell, and I fought this blink of melancholia, lazily kissing his neck. My hands searched for his cock. I was about to beg for an encore.Knocked down by this memorable dream, I was puzzled to have forgotten all my sensations. Why did I cut myself from experiences like those? I aspired to feel that all the time. So I knew what I had to do. Deep inside my decision was made.Basically I figured out two possibilities. First—the dark option—I could stay in Paris, alone. Start to drink to forget my despair. Soon, I would be remembered as the artist with a brilliant but brief shooting star career who was discovered by a neighbor, lying in her Parisian loft, bathing in her own vomit until it stifled her to death. Or, with the other option, I could start to savor my existence once and for all, go back to New York and reconquer Tom. Perhaps it might be too late, but I had to tell him what I felt. I had to strip myself naked, not literally, I had previously done that, I had to disclose my mind. I needed to tell him I trusted him, for real, not only with words. I might have to beg him to forgive me. I wished him to grasp that I would stop loving him like a soldier at war against my fears of an ending who would destroy us. However, I would love him, cherish him like an architect building bridges, brick by brick, with infinite patience.My plan wasn’t really clear. But I was courageous enough to put that into action, to go back to New York and challenge Tom. To be continued...

Anna-Lisa
The sun was languidly lurking behind the skyscrapers. Today it hadn’t been radiant enough to warm up the ground as snow overlaid the streets and hadn’t even melted a little. Furthermore, the night would be quite frosty, then the sidewalks would be transformed into skating rinks.As I was completely freezing, I wrapped myself into a long woolen coat and added knitted gloves and a scarf. Only the top of my ears cropped out, yet my nose was well protected. I felt like a snowman in an haute-couture dress.Again, Max had organized a most original party, one of his crazy ideas, which would lure a vast mob in spite of the winter weather. One week after New-Year’s Eve, this exceptional event was set for Max’s benefactors, his favorite clients, and family and friends. It was Max’s way to keep on celebrating the launch of Tom’s dazzling career after his success in Paris. I could admit that I was truly proud and excited for him. Despite the fact that I hated parties, Max and I estimated this could be a good opportunity to approach Tom safely. Honestly I was really nervous, so scared that I was drained of adrenaline. I was shaking, even my bones were cold. However that wouldn’t stop me and I could rely on Max to help me. With his support, I was able to come back to New York peacefully. He settled everything, so I got quietly ready for my plan. On my side, I only had to take care of my speech and my outfit. I rehearsed my lines for weeks, writing countless versions in my head. I tried on several different evening gowns. Finally, I choose a vintage Chanel black dress. An old model would hopefully bring me luck, like at our first meeting. Yet, just picking a cocktail dress for an outdoor reception in early January was a nightmare alone. The only thing I couldn’t predict was Tom’s reaction. As my name wasn’t registered on the official guest list, he wasn’t expecting me and, I doubted that Max informed him about my comeback. I could sense that my agent was almost as anxious as I was, which wasn’t reassuring.At the entrance of the building, I could see the unusual lights on the roof, a sign that the mood was put on. The doorman pointed the way to the elevator, a path that I—that we—previously walked on. A couple was waiting for the lift. They recognized me instantly. Agatha, the trendy gallery owner of Soho, was wearing an expensive black mink coat and was escorted by her latest boyfriend, a younger stud than the Wall Street millionaire she used to date. She kissed me on both cheeks, as I had plague and added a noisy “smmmush.” She complimented me on my look and my new fancy haircut. My hair was indeed longer with extra cupper waves. Her man was slightly more reserved, I would say a tad embarrassed. I recalled meeting him a couple of times in the past, as Roberto was Max’s former lover some months ago. Nothing in that world could surprise me anymore, especially not Max’s tolerance about his love affairs. In fact, Max likely didn’t even care to meet him that night. At the moment, what I liked about Agatha, was that she could never stop babbling. As I had nothing to tell her, I was able to remain silent and no awkward blank could be heard.The doors opened to a crowded roof top. The view was as always outstanding. The Empire State building flashed with the Christmas lighting. At each corner of the roof, a giant brazier warmed the public who danced to the music of a French DJ to overcome the chilliness. In the middle, a counter bar was chiseled in a large block of ice, lit up with blue and purple LED, offered luxurious champagnes, quirky winter cocktails, eggnog, spicy warm wine, Irish coffee, and hot creamy cocoa. We were welcomed by a cup of this chocolate mixture with a hint of cinnamon and coconut and a generous drop of rum. A melted hot chocolate fountain attracted other greedy guests with its marshmallows and fruits. These comforting winter fragrances weren’t able to make me forget this summer night when Tom and I had sex on this specific roof. He was so stunning and dauntless. He was the man I fell for.Yet, I couldn’t find Max or Tom. They would certainly be chitchatting somewhere and Max was praising Tom’s talent. I firmly hold my hot cup with my hands and sipped the cocoa softly.Large paintings were displayed at strategic points, where light spots reinforced their colors. I stayed speechless in front of one. It was bigger than what Tom usually does, but they were obviously his. I identified his typical brush strokes. However, the shades were darker, a lot of blacks and navy blues. The strokes were murkier, so angry and incredibly tragic. The normal shinier blues were mostly absent. Only a few touches emerged like the last hopes were about to disappear and leave only grief and emptiness. Those were his most heartbreaking works ever. I could feel how much I wounded him. I crushed him. At that moment, I ached for him and loved him even more. Altogether, I acknowledged that reconquering him might be harder than I expected. What I inflicted myself with was horrible, but I didn’t think that it would be even worse for him. I couldn’t figure if he would be able to forgive me, or if I could forgive myself.A muffled vibration in my pocket interrupted my reflection, a message popped up. Perhaps Max texted to tell me where to find him. However, my cell phone showed that James sent a picture. I opened the attachment and discovered a sonogram. A fetus the size of a small melon was sucking his thumb. Nevertheless, I could discern the outline of a cute tiny face with a minuscule baby’s nose. James had added, “Congratulations Yankee! This is your future Goddaughter. Her mother and she are going well, but my son was quite disappointed to receive a little sister. When I told him that girls can play football too, he got thrilled. The whole family is looking forward to meeting you. XO. James. PS: break a leg!”Those few words brought me a smile and encouraged me to keep on. Since James moved back to London, we often chatted through Skype®. I had been able to greet the entire family on screen. His son was more adorable and chicky that I had expected, and his wife was truly friendly.I started to appreciate this new impression of belonging to a clan. I also began to remember my childhood and asserted that I used to have a real family, too. My parents didn’t want to let me down. They did the best they could to raise and care for me despite their own sorrow. Although, they suffered as much as I did, they didn’t stop trying. Maybe they weren’t perfect and made many mistakes, but I wasn’t responsible for their failures. Nowadays they are gone, yet I didn’t have to stay alone. I was allowed to love and be loved. And from now on I would focus on that.Out of the corner of my eye I glimpsed Agatha walking towards me so I discretely moved to the next display. Into a glass box, a split little clay sculpture was laid out. The fragment of Tom’s profile I carved that infamous day, that lethal day. The statue was divided in two, like an artifact found on an archeology site, a proof of a longtime past. Just beside it, a woman’s silhouette was sketched with a brush. This single blue line was briskly cut, an incomplete gesture, two damaged people watching in different directions. During this exhibition, Tom decided to publicly expose his scars, so everyone could witness his destroyed soul. It came across as an accusation. I felt guilty, bleak, and I wished to escape.Suddenly my neck sensed a sort of electricity, a well-know magnetized presence. I raised my chin to discover two piercing blue eyes peering at me from the fence of the roof. His hair was longer and his beard was scruffy. His gaze was like a drafty wind. Tom was tracking me. I could only see his harsh sight like I was watching through a tunnel. He stared motionless, with a stony stare. I never caught this expression on him before. It wasn’t his ritual playful mischievousness, but anger, hate and worst: contempt. I stood there empty, with the sensation that my body was collapsing into million pieces and I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t look away. I didn’t even notice that Max was at my side, stroking my back.“Darling, he doesn’t want to see or talk to you. Maybe, you should go back home. I am so sorry.” Max said painfully.Completely stoned, I shadowed Max to the way out. I wasn’t able to speak. I wasn’t able to cry or scream. I was simply haunted by his eyes. My agent called his chauffeur and asked to wait for me in his car in front of the building. He attempted to cheer me up.“At least you didn’t upset anybody with your famous sarcasm tonight!”It definitely felt flat. I didn’t react. I couldn’t even assimilate the venue around me.“Let me guide her, Max.” Said a sharp voice.Tom grabbed my arm forcefully and pushed me carelessly into the elevator. Then he motioned Max to stay out.“Did you come here to find a place high enough to jump and succeed to kill you this time?” he said intimidating. Once more, he eyed me with the same angry face, clenched jaws and pursed lips.“I’m sorry.” I murmured rubbing my sore arms.At that instant, my will abandoned me, and I searched to hide. I moved back in a corner and looked down.“I shouldn’t have come.” I whispered.I sensed him approaching little by little and his thumb went fondling my cheek gently.“Oh… Anna-Lisa!” he sighed.I was too scared to bare his look, yet he wiped away my falling tears. His face drew closer as he hankered to smell my hair. His presence and his touch made me shiver. I closed my eyes when his lips reached mine, tenderly at first. I could taste whiskey in his kiss blended with the salty flavor of my tears. He was trembling too. I could tell that he was sobbing as well. However, I didn’t want to break that moment, so I took everything he gave me. Eagerly, his athletic body pressed on mine, tossing me against the thin partition of the elevator car. He pushed the “stop” button, which ceased its motion in a jolt. His kisses went deeper. His tongue was avid. His desire was urgent and he kneaded my flesh in a hurry. He opened my coat and squeezed my breasts with needy hands. I had lost my mind at the first brush from his lips, so my body didn’t control itself under his demanding touch. I couldn’t breathe. I grasped his shoulders and clenched to him. He pulled my dress up on my waist and tore my panties away. The lace unraveled and my skin endured a burn. This torture was sweet. I tightened in anticipation. I could feel his hard cock bulging against my thighs as he hungrily kept on kissing me. He pined me on the wall, his hand around my neck. His other hand opened his fly, and my leg circled his hips to draw him closer. I moaned, but I was jailed by his mouth. He penetrated me ragingly. He didn’t bother about hurting me, yet I needed him so badly that I couldn’t care less. He rocked in me, fast and hefty. Each back and forth was a claim, a punishment and a pleasure. It was a battle and we surrendered. He buried his nose into my hair, and his tears mingled with mine on my skin. He was halting. His cock was like a sword dragging my belly. My back scratched the walls at every movement. He came quick and strong, roaring into my ears. My orgasm surged to me. I taut and we both stood immobile.Afterwards, he didn’t look at me. He didn’t say anything. He just switched the elevator on and, he turned away. He properly put his shirt in his pants and closed his zipper off. I arranged myself the best I could. I had to kneel to fetch my panties left on the floor. As the doors opened, I heard his hostile voice declare,“You should go away and don’t come back. I don’t want to see you anymore.”It felt like a bullet in my heart. It stopped beating and exploded in my chest. It numbed me. I exited the lift senseless. The doors closed behind me, and I was left alone with my tears.***
Tom
Rather squiffy and exhausted, I scarpered the junket very late. I was frustrated and bitter. I was upset with her, but with me too. How could I have been so weak? I couldn’t figure out what happened. Surely, I wanted to punish her, however, when I saw her so fragile in that lift that I desired only to console her, to cherish her. Yet, this was hopeless. We had been only able to share agony. And now I was only twinging, of course.Max had kept me company for a while. We had just silently stared at the view, drinking whiskey, freezing in our jackets. I knew he invited her without telling me, but I didn’t have enough strength to blame him. I could perceive he was sorry and chagrined too. Weeks ago, I took the decision to let her go and I was still trying to get on. I had to stick to that. I wasn’t ready for her yet.When I reached my floor, I yawned and dragged my feet into the corridor. I only dreamt of slumping on my bed, sleeping and forgetting. Nonetheless, I was surprised to notice a package behind my door. Someone was kipping on the mat. It wasn’t a random homeless, but Anna-Lisa. My heart started to bump rapidly. I bent over to carefully wake her up. She was wearing the same dress as during the party. She might have waited for me all night. She looked at me and barely articulated,“Hello!”I caught her puffy red eyes. She clearly had endlessly wept.“Hello, Anna-Lisa.”Whatever she looked like, I found her so stunning. I knew I wouldn’t be able to forget her and I would for sure keep those eyes in my mind forever. I could see a growing tear, when she figured out I was standing next to her.I offered my hand and invited her inside. She walked timidly into my flat. I caught her delicate figure and her milky skin as on the verge of evaporating. She appeared so frail. My chest cramped. I leaned onto the wall to gain balance. She wandered to the window, and the rising sun revealed the flames in her hair. I intended to walk towards her, but she waved me to stop.“Tom, please stay where you are, or I would be wimpy and fall into your arms. I need to speak to you. Would you agree to listen without interrupting me, please?”“OK. I am too tired to fight anyway.”She turned her back to me and she sighed.“I don’t know where to start. I have rehearsed this a thousand times, but everything is so messed up… Do you remember ‘The broken woman,’ my sculpture at Max’s loft?”“Whom in front of we met? Of course, I do.”“Did you know at that time it was a self-portrait? This name suited better than I imagined. I was this woman, shattered in a hundred fragments that managed to hang on together. God only knows how! You came into my life like a wrecking ball and everything changed. I am sure you sensed my fragility. Without a doubt, you attempted to rescue and love me. And, yes, I needed it. I wished you could have been my savior. I believed in you. Unfortunately every part of me was scattered all over.”I meant to apologize. That it wasn’t my intention, but she didn’t give me the time and continued.“I lost myself, lost my sanity. I loved you so much, more than myself. You made me feel alive. You made me feel safe and in peace. Nevertheless, I was so scared when you were away. I was afraid of everything. I lost control and all went blur.”“Is that why you wanted to die? Because of me?”She eyed me with tears rolling down.“Oh no! It wasn’t your fault, you did nothing wrong. I was terrified to lose you. I worshipped you. Somehow it was easier to stop feeling anything, how I used to my whole life. Death seemed to be the only solution for an insane fraction of second. I never wanted to hurt anyone but me. I never imagined you would suffer that much. I know you did, I could read it in your paintings. I am sorry. I don’t know if you could forgive me one day, or even if I would. I merit all the pain you would make me endure. I deserve your punishment and rejection.”“Please forgive me. I didn’t mean to be that ghastly.”I was lying though. I had wanted to rebuff her. I had needed her to pay. I had been in need of revenge because I was disgruntled. I didn’t want her to win and capitulate so readily. I still wished to be unshakeable. Yet, I was watching her angelic body and listen to her vulnerable voice that I began to doubt.“You were allowed to harm me. I know it’s probably too late to tell you this. I should have explained what I was enduring when you were by my side. I should have trusted you more. I might have thought that you would understand me; that you would read through me, but you couldn’t. I didn’t let you come near. I was just hoping you would rush through the doors, yet the barrier was too high, nobody could. I have learned that the only person who could glue the pieces is myself. At the end, you made me realize how much I was broken. Today I have the craft to rebuild my life. I regret that I loved you for the wrong reason.”“I am glad you are alive and that you are doing better.” I said with disillusionment. She loved me, a past tense.“When I was in Paris, I missed your presence and your ability to soothe me. However I discovered something else. Not once, you deserted my head. I missed so much more of you. First your smile, the one you granted me in the morning and made me believe in a good day. The bright smile you threw to everyone when you laugh or when you enjoy what you are doing. The kinky grin that rose when you flirt and you are proud of your cocky self. I also yearned for the way you looked at me, with your intense blue eyes, that I believed to be the only breathing person in the world. This look you offered to everyone you talk to, giving your complete attention as if they are the only human being whom counted. I longed for your never-ending gabbling, when you weigh every word as it could change the course of the Sun. How your thoughts crossed your face and your eyes, as you took your time caressing your lips and chin with your fingers. I craved your stamina, this confidence that shined from your body. It used to reassure me, to turn me on. Although, it is greater than that, you are spreading joy with each of your movements, this vitality contaminates everybody around. I missed this fuse of sweetness and verve, your generosity, your intellect. I missed your laugh…”“Shit, you had me at hello” I cut her off and sent the kind of naughty grin she mentioned.“Oh come on, Tom! We aren't in a movie. I’m serious.” She said pretty shortly.“I’m aware of this.” I giggled and ran to her. I seized her face in my hands and tried to read her eyes. “Heaven, do you still love me?” “Yes, I do! Dummy.” She sighed and hit my shoulder. “Will you be able to forgive me some day?” She asked, pleading.“I already have, Heaven. I love you too. I always have and always will.”I kissed her madly, when she hemmed and hawed in my mouth.“Would you support me while I fix myself? Will you let me confide in you and listen to me when needed? Things may change, will you be patient?”“Now you are the talkative one. First let me show you how much I love you and shut up, will you?”“Just one last thing: I love you, Gorgeous!”And that easily, I took her back into my life and into my arms. I kissed her wildly, like a lion licking his prey. I know she would eternally be mine, because nature bought us together. It was always obvious, infinite forces created our souls to be together. The ancient animal spirit in me could only adore her. The beast in me could only love her forcefully. I would relish her body and mind like a starving creature. I would honour her like her absolute slave. She would be my gentle and mighty woman until the end of time.

This mid summer in New York, the atmosphere was sort of awkward, a strange mixture from touristic pressure and expectations. The heat increased rapidly and everyone was looking for a couple of weeks of vacation and quitting a sultry Manhattan.I wasn’t spared and unfortunately I was kept busy by the last aspects of my next exhibition. Sorry, I should have said our exhibition. Indeed, for the first time, after many years of work side-by-side, in the same atelier, we would at last present our art together. Creating so closely transformed our artwork in a giant mutual playground. Every masterpiece echoed, talked, or set a debate. Presently, we would show this publicly.Art magazines often compared his paintings with my sculptures when the gossip media commented the relationship of two of the most rewarded and famous artists of the 21st century. Nevertheless, no museum had been lucky enough to reunite our work.Since January, Agatha had opened a gallery in Soho that she owned with Helen Dresher. In no time, it became the artsiest place in town. Of course, she was harassing us to make her the honor to host “The Couple,” as we were called. We couldn’t refuse, as Helen was deeply involved. More than just the sister of my agent, she was now entitled to be my boss. Last year, I finally considered sharing Tom’s Chair at Columbia. I discovered that I was strangely very good at teaching. I wallowed in helping people to explore new perspectives and learning to create out of their comfort zone. This position allowed me to be autonomous and offered Tom more freedom on his own.On a ladder, a technician was taking order to install the lightening. He followed my instructions on where and how to appropriately point the light spots on a sculpture — “The Content Woman”— portraying a girl’s face in an explicit blissful moment, a mat and smooth white silk porcelain, altogether fragile and unfailing: a part of me, of Paris, and Tom.Behind the glass door the silhouette of Tom emerged. Trimmed blonde hair and thick gray glasses framed his cerulean eyes. He was wearing his old navy slacks and his comfy sporty blue shirt, and he was almost as tall as the door. He was still the same man I fell in love with years ago. He opened the window, just enough to let two pairs of short legs run through. I heard the sounds of four flip-flop shoes clapping on the marble floor with a hasty rhythm.“Mommy!”In due course, I noticed two little frizzy blonde girls racing towards me. They wore matching summer dresses, one pink and the other purple. Their angelic faces looked exactly like their dad, with big dreamy aquamarine eyes and bright smiles. Thankfully, I recalled having given birth to those kids, because I was sometimes searching for my contribution. Maybe I brought them their obsession for fancy shoes as today their sandals were covered with sparkly butterflies. For weeks they begged to wear them.I bowed down to kiss my flawless bundles of joy. Ella and Louise hugged me firmly. They gave the sweetest kisses in the whole universe, not quite as delicious as their father’s, only wetter and stickier. God, they smelled divine, probably the candy-like shampoo they adored. It was an appropriate moment for the technician to have a coffee break, so he went to get his pack of cigarettes, when Ella said,“Hello! Who are you?”“Me?” He asked amused, “’I’m Mike. I am fixing the light for your mother.”“OK!” said Louise.Definitely, I had bold little women. I had to admit that, once again, this side came from their dad.Max was having a phone conversation in another room, but hearing the melodious voices of the twins was all he needed to appear.“My Ladybugs!” He shouted, standing in the door frame with welcoming wide arms.“Uncle Max!” they both screamed.Their ponytails galloped in the air when they joyfully rushed to him. They somehow managed to wave Mike goodbye and say a brief, “bye!” Running, one more thing they had in common with Tom. They probably grew from all four directly to sprinting, and you could call yourself lucky if they sped in the same direction.I was relishing the view of my two babies climbing Max like a tree. He was chunky enough to lift them both in his arms. When I spotted Tom smiling at me, patiently waiting until I would pay attention to him.“Good afternoon, Gorgeous!” I said brushing my thumb on his jaw, and kissed him.“Good afternoon, Heaven!” He murmured while lingering on my mouth. “I figured that if I bring the girls here, Uncle Max may agree to babysit. I know he can’t resist them.”“Oh really? Is that the only thing your creative mind figured out?”“Heheheh, if my inventive mind recalls, we met precisely six years ago tonight. So I thought that Max could put the girls to bed, in their own rooms. Then, he could sleep in the spear room of our flat while we borrowed his loft and its fantastic library!” He winked.Gently, he placed his hands on my waist and drew me closer. I fondled his chest with my palms.“Tom, you’re just a naughty sex god! On my side, I’ll let you arrange this with Max. And don’t forget you have to convince David as well.”“David! He proposed to cook us a meal and leave us to join Max in our apartment.” He proudly grinned.I teased, “So, everything is already planned! I should have expected that. You’re more a mischief god, after all!”A lot of events happened these past six years. When he accepted me in his life again, everything seemed possible. It was a whole new adventure where passion would ultimately give place to habits and daily routine — something way more challenging. Altogether, being a couple wasn’t easy. I had made a lot of progress by admitting my fears, willing to trust and rely on him. Initially, we decided to go slow and take care of the issues as they’d come. Yet, our personal needs weren’t based on the same speed. Anyhow, Tom kept his promises, he listened and gave me time to adapt and catch him. We communicated a lot, and in all likelihood, I became the most talkative. This only detail might have made the whole difference. Occasionally he got frustrated, claiming he wasn’t able to carry all of my problems, so I let him have time and space for him. I could also be the patient one. We always found a way to reach each other and remained a united couple.On my side, a therapist in New York supported me. I could traverse my own path. I didn’t confine anything to my lover. I preferred to license a professional to do his job. There were things that a stranger could bring me that Tom shouldn’t and vice versa — actually more vice versa, thankfully. I was also stronger and more independent. So, on his side, Tom had to learn to be less possessive and jealous. However he was still excited that I proved to him that I was only his. At the end, my depression faded. I didn’t know if it would come back one day. I was only sure that I wouldn’t be alone to face it. I could count on my man to uphold me. I got tremendously less anxious, but most of all, I was laughing every day. I was infected by Tom’s absolute positivity. He gave me hopes and brought me thrills. He simply made me parade with a juvenile grin.As an artist, I didn’t lose any of my sensitivity. I wasn’t this damaged and melancholic artist anymore. My recovered stamina opened new horizons to my creativity. I explored more territories about me, about my partner, and about a life that I never experienced before. I found out unknown aspects of me. Although fragility remained, my art became more audacious, more vivid. My career took a fresh start and this was positive for everyone.While we gradually came closer and mightier together, everybody’s life changed. We were invited to two weddings and no funeral, yet a divorce, as well as a christening. There was an indubitable fact, I never liked parties, but not as much as I hated wedding ceremonies. I usually got bored, felt obliged to have fun, and to skim over the artificial romantic fluffs I ended up grumpy and drunk on a chair. Of course, when James called upon us for his second wedding with his wife, I wasn’t really keen to go. However, Tom and I traveled to his hometown of London and that was a memorable trip. He organized a complete sightseeing of the city, showing us his favorite places. I met a few of his old friends, who retold jokes on Tom’s misspent youth. But most of all, I met his family. His sisters were adorable and we had a blast during a woman-only shopping day. They chose clothes for me that their brother might like. There was no doubt they knew his soft spot for cleavages. I got fond of his parents too. His mom tried to teach me how to bake Tom’s favorite pudding. In less than no time I gave up, especially after having a bite of it. I was such a terrible cook and Diane was a goddess in the Kitchen. And like that, my family increased. I would have more people to love and who loved me back that I could have ever dreamt to.James’s wedding was simple and lovely. Against all odds, I enjoyed it. We danced, we laughed heartily, and we sang at the karaoke—Tom sang and I acted as the background singer. My man was able to change the most sluggish tradition into the most meaningful moment. Just watching James’s expression when he saw his bride walking down the isle brought me to tears.That wasn’t as intense as the Christening of my Goddaughter, Lily, three weeks after the wedding. When I held this beautiful little doll in my arms, when she grabbed my finger in her tiny hands, and she stared at me with her huge dark eyes, I realized I would remain related to this small human being forever. This afternoon James’ son was also overjoyed to have found a mate to play football, so Tom recovered his five year old self. I also remembered him cradling Lily, and whispering a lullaby to her to make her sleep later that evening. I was aware of his effect on me, but this moment was absolutely marvelous. I nearly wanted to have kids with this man, and yet I got scared. From now on, having Lily in London gave us plenty of excuses to travel back and visit Tom’s family.The second wedding came much as a surprise. For a long time Max wasn’t hanging out with his usual young tanned body build stallions that we honestly thought he was single. Some weeks after Helen had celebrated her divorce in a trendy restaurant in Lower East Side, we were invited for dinner in Max’s loft. He explained that he needed us to be probers for one of his buddies. Max was helping a Chef to launch his business, a delicatessen and caterer shop. The first bombshell was Helen plus-one whom she introduced as her new girl friend: Agatha. This coming out was unexpected for everyone, including for the couple, who discovered their attraction for the same sex only recently.However, the dinner was delicious, David concocted us a fabulous meal, the kind you would wake up in the middle of the night and eat all of the leftovers, if Tom didn’t previously feast on everything. He asked for a second plate from the starter to the dessert. The conversation was light and amusing, so my usual bad mood was left behind and I appreciated being surrounded and partying. I was well used to catching Tom or Max disapprovingly eyeing when I was about to throw sarcasm, but here they didn’t need to. It wasn’t uncommon to see Tom finishing my sentence, adding humor of his own. In reality, I was able to do the same with him. This was a game between us. That evening, neither Tom nor I could find anything witty to answer Max’s announcement. He and David would get married.David wasn’t like Max’s habitual crushes. Like him, he was around 50, with salt and pepper hair. Although he had a je-ne-sais-quoi that made him charming, he wasn’t a top model. He was rather slim and average sized. The two men were secretly dating each other for a while and they decided to settle down, an enormous step for Max.That’s how Tom and I sat in the second weeding. And that time, I awaited it. I was delighted to see my friend so radiant. I romantically danced with my man and I could tell that Tom totally got under my skin to the point that he changed me. Strangely this reception didn’t push us to get married. Tom joked about the fact that I could be able to say “No” just to avoid being the center of attention of a cheesy ceremony — according to me. So I dared him, just to check. So he promised that one day he would propose, when I least expected it. I am still waiting. But this became a private joke that we repeated for years, imagining every crazier scenarios: in a taxi, in the rain, on Christmas Eve, and various other special and hopefully not too phony moments. We never found the opportunity, because other great events happened. Our career took a major turn and we became the parents of incredible twins, a blessing and another unexpected turn—yes, these days it is still likely to forget your pill.On this six-year anniversary, we were looking forward to having a bit of intimacy tonight. Ella and Louise ran in front of Max who came back while we were kissing.“Please, Get a room!” teased Max. “Does the cutest couple have everything sealed everything in the gallery? Shall we leave?”“Don’t worry Max, we have time before the opening night.” I specified.“Great! So what about us all having ice cream right now?” suggested Max.The two strident and deafening voices that yelled were sufficient to accept his proposition, as if we had any other choice. On New York heated pavement Max walked in front of us with each girl hanging on his arms. They pleaded Uncle Max to swing them. Hand in hand, Tom and I observed the bouncing trio with ecstatic beams. Watching this tall and completely bald guy playing under the sun with these two blondes wearing heart-shaped sunglasses made me think of shiny Mr. Proper with Shirley-Temple-like twins.“Tom? Do you remember the piece of art that Max ordered for “Venice Biennale”?”“Yes, I do. That was six years ago, on our second meeting.” He winked.“Well, we never did it!”“Are you kidding? We produced our masterpieces four years ago and they came in a pair. Look at the two perfect angels over there.”“You’re so right! I don’t know if we could do something that perfect again. But, Gorgeous, I don’t have anything against training…”“Oh Heaven, who’s the horniest now?” he said giving me a peck on the neck.I carefully watched our children giggling, so alive and happy, that I knew I wouldn’t change any moment of my life.
