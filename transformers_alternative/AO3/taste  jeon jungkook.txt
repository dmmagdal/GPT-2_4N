Bright yellow-orange spills scattered onto the dimly-light canvas called the sky; soft clouds moving so slowly that one would not even notice, unless they hadn't taken their eyes off from the glossy sky.And that was exactly what Jeon Jungkook was up to, leaning against the railing of the balcony. Donning his uniform with a big smile on his face, he couldn't help but feel excited about what was about to happen next.That was, until light from the sun - which he hadn't even noticed rising - hits the grumpy boy who is lying on the floor, asleep in his sleeping bag.Correction; he was sleeping."Close the fucking balcony, dammit." Min Yoongi's voice calls out, taking the other boy off guard. Closing the door and stepping inside quickly, Jungkook has a little grin on his face as he glances across the room. All his other band mates, who promised to attend his high school entrance ceremony, were all crashing on the sofa, the mattresses, and one was even content with just a blanket and pillow- Jung Hoseok.He felt overwhelmed as he got down the staircase, off to take the van to school. He was early; hell, he was half an hour early, but he loved the yellow blazer that came along as part of the uniform. It had been a dream for him, to be able to attend School of Performing Arts in Seoul... And knowing that his "hyungs" decided to stay after a long concert just so they could attend his ceremony...That was why Jungkook had a big smile on his face even before the cameraman begins to shoot the day, to upload it for the fans that they were gaining more and more with every passing day.   The rest of the members of BTS - a Korean pop boy band that had recently formed and was gaining popularity - lazily get themselves up, getting ready to head to Jungkook's big day."I can't feel my eyes." Jin yawns, while Jimin stretches a little. They would give anything for more sleep, and yet, they all dragged themselves up to hurry to head off to entrance ceremony.As expected, multiple fans of the group were aware of this, and they had to go through a lot of photo shoots before they could filter their way through the crowds, and onto the balcony of the main hall."Look, there's Jungkook!" Taehyung notices, when the younger boy turns around and glances secretly at where the commotion was happening."Look at him being so small and cute!" Rapmon has to say  making Hoseok grin wide as he sings out an excited 'Jungkookie!!'The members of BTS were so close with each other; They loved each other so much, and even though Jungkook was too embarrassed to turn around to look at where the others were at and asking him to talk to his friends, he was so happy.A little shy, too, when he notices some of the girls whisper and glance at him. He felt a little out of place, but happy, nonetheless.   a   /   n   ;    this     book     is     dedicated     for     the     love     of     my     life   ,     kety    .

As the years passed by, Jungkook felt less and less excited for school.Of course, he was happy that he could practice his dance skills and train his signing, at school too.But he would much rather graduate as soon as possible instead, and be able to go on tour and not feel tied down to his grades being affected.Language class was the one he hated the most... And as he tied his shoelaces and boards the car waiting for him, he wishes that this semester - his final one - would end soon."Jungkook! Haven't seen you since last semester ended," A friend greets, "Except for on TV!"The boy laughs a little, taking the many, many pieces of paper and notes in his locker and stuffing it in his bag. Along with being in a world famous boy band came the responsibility of handling that fame, as well.For Jungkook, he liked getting the letters. Even though he conversed with his friends occasionally, he found it more interesting to clear his mind and come up with potential lyrics or tunes he could make songs for. And when his friends would talk about girls and games - if it wasn't overwatch - he would read what he received and smile, sometimes even writing thank you notes in response, if it was signed.When morning assembly was over, he and his friends hurried to language class, which regretfully was on first period.Jungkook sits on the second row, taking his books out as he notices a girl coming up to the table he was at.It was [Last name] [First name], and when she asks if she could join him, Jungkook nods instantly. From the past three semesters, he had learned that [Name] was good at language and writing lyrics, even though she had a lot of difficulties when it came to dancing.Both Jungkook and [Name] were quiet people, so they didn't talk a lot. In fact, all they did were exchanging names, and even when they were assigned a reading task, they didn't talk much. [Name] picks out her Korean dictionary and the two are able to finish their work in a flash.I guess this class will be easier now, with (Name). The boy thinks, as he glances at the girl. She was looking up something on her phone, and as usual, he rummages through his bag and takes out some letters he had received.The third note he picks is unsigned, and when he opens the sheet of paper, he is shocked to see that it was lyrics to a song.Not a full song, but half of it, from what he could tell. Having read to the bottom, Jungkook notices a small note at the end."Please give this to Suga-shi."Now, it wasn't the first time when Jungkook was requested to be the messenger to deliver something to one of his band mates. But he would always politely decline, as his groupmates had asked him to do so.But this time...He quickly puts the note in the side pocket of his backpack.He couldn't wait to show it to Yoongi.   "It wasn't signed either," Jungkook explains, as he sits with his friends and ate noodles with them.Yoongi looks as if he had just woken up from a nap. Rubbing his eyes with the back of his palms, he scans the writing a little."I like how punk it is. Whoever wrote this definitely learned you enough." Namjoon has to say, taking a sip of his chicken soup."Yeah, well. Later." The note is carelessly stuffed into his back pocket, and Yoongi sits down at the table to start eating.Jungkook feels a little distressed that Namjoon was the only one who liked the song as much as he did.   Days later, Jungkook walks into the studio to see Jimin and Hoseok hitting pens on the coffee table and making tunes. Meanwhile, Yoongi sits between them, mumbling something."What are you doing?" The boy wants to know, walking up to the three. Yoongi continues what he was on with, and it takes a while for Jungkook to realise that the lyrics he was singing - or rapping, to be accurate - was the one he himself had handed over to Yoongi."This is actually fucking good." He has to comment. "Jungkook,  find out who wrote this, please.""But it wasn't signed...""Damn."The conversation ended there, and the rest of the group walks in. Breakfast today was a treat by Jin, and after an energetic meal, Suga offers the high schooler a lift."If you find out who wrote it  let me know." Yoongi requests."Of course."Jungkook follows his usual routine, taking out the letters from his locker and hurrying to class. As soon as he gets seated, he greets [Name] and then proceeds to see what he had received today.Luckily, he was a little early to class so the teacher wasn't present yet."[Name], what are you listening to?" A friend stands in front of her, and the boy watches the way the pink-haired friend of her's unplugs her headphones, making music fill the class.[Name] hurries to get the volume down, successfully turning it off before the teacher shows up....... But fails in hiding the fact that she was listening to a song by BTS.How ironic it was, that what Jungkook heard was his own lines from the song."[Name], are you an ARMY?" He asks with a little smile. He then notices the wallpaper on her phone, and seeing that it was a picture of him makes his eyes widen."Y-Yes." She frantically thought of ways to explain the situation, but coming clean seemed like the only option."I love BTS. I've been a fan since you guys first started out." [Name] admits, turning a little red before she spoke next. "You're my... My... Bias wrecker."This makes Jungkook laugh a little, his set of teeth showing and making a couple girls at the back gasp."Then, the Bias is...?""... Yoongi-shi."The dreamy expression on her face makes Jungkook laugh yet again. It always amused him, every ARMY he met never failed to amuse him.And he was always so surprised and thankful for the endless support."I wrote a bit of a song, for him, a week ago. You probably threw that in the trash along with everything else you get, right? It must be really hard to be famous, huh..."Jungkook freezes in his spot."Wait. You wrote it, [Name]? You're the writer of 'taste'?""Yes " She says. "It was me."

Jungkook could barely hide how excited he was. He wanted to dance around in joy, but that didn't seem appropriate for now.Maybe he'd do that later...Meanwhile, as he bubbled inside with excitement, the teacher steps in, making the students fall silent and making [Name] turn back to the lesson instead.He could barely hold in how much he wanted to tell Yoongi that he found who wrote the song for him.Yoongi would be so proud, and happy, Jungkook just knew it.Stuffing they letters in his bag, the boy opens his notebook and begins immersing himself into the lesson.At least, he tried to.But all he wanted to do was to ask [Name] all the questions that were squirming in his mind.As soon as the bell rings, Jungkook has packed all of his books and is ready to step outside.When he glances at [Name], she silently packs her belongings. With two of his friends, Jungkook steps outside the classroom, to head downstairs.He enjoyed dance classes, but apparently, [Name] didn't seem too good at it.She shows up a little later to class, and Jungkook sidles up to her and asks if she would mind being his partner for the day."You could ask anyone in the class. Why are you asking me?" [Name] asks, causing the boy to part his lips as he thought of a proper answer."Well...""There are prettier girls in here, who want to dance with you." She adds, pointing at one girl at the corner, who had kept her gaze on him for the entirety of the class.There wasn't any point in trying to hide anything, that Jungkook knew."I read your note and gave it to Yoongi-shi " He whispers."Oh."Three choreographers were in charge of dance class, and one of them steps in front of the small self-built stage to start warm-ups."Sooo?" The boy asks, tilting his head to a side. A little smile forms on [Name]'s face at that; Jungkook was undeniably adorable."So what?" She asks.Jungkook blinks in surprise at her response. He expected her to be excited at that news. He even thought that she might ask him to get Yoongi to meet with her.But she didn't, and after her struggles with class, she is about to leave when Jungkook manages to poke her shoulder again."Yes?""You won't ask me what Yoongi-shi thought about your song?""Yeah, because he might have thought it was shit. I'd rather not know what he had to say, instead."[Name] had a point, even the boy had to agree. But one would usually not think that far ahead, so Jungkook found himself blinking a couple times, watching her figure disappear along with the others in class.   Yoongi was just as excited about [Name] as Jungkook had been.Had been. Right now, he wasn't sure how to feel anymore. He had on a scowl on his face when he got out of class, and Jimin was the one who offered to treat him to "make Jungkookie feel better", is what he said.But he doubted that he would feel better."[Name]. That's a beautiful name. Do you think she'll let me use the lyrics for my mixtape album?"The younger boy shrugs in response, taking out the letters he had with him, some of them which he didn't get the time to finish reading earlier today."Our little maknae sure has a lot of admirers, eh?" Taehyung has to say, taking a sip of his soda. "Ehehe, it's not like that!""He's so talented, so of course it's like that." Jin has to add, making Jungkook shake his head and laugh a little. As he scrolled through the notes in hand, he comes across a familiar looking writing.He freezes as soon as his eyes land on the title."Yoongi-shi, it's..."At the mention of his name, Yoongi lifts his arm from over his face, turning to look at what Jungkook is handing to him. Blinking in confusion, there is a little pout on his face when he squints at the note handed."She wrote the other part for me..."Hoseok is peering over Yoongi's shoulder, his eyes wide as he reads the lyrics written on it. When he begins mumbling under his breath, Jungkook knew exactly what was running on the older boy's mind."I want to meet her.""Ufufu? You want to lift your lazy ass up to actually do something?" Namjoon wants to know, dodging the foot that Yoongi kicks out towards him."Maybe you can meet up with her when you're free." Jimin offers, in advice, while Jungkook only shrugs. This makes Yoongi squint his eyes at the other male."When the hell am I free?"Hoseok has a good time laughing while the baseless chatter among the group continued.   "I want to be a composer. I don't really like my voice, and you can totally see where my dancing skills lie at." [Name] shares with Jungkook, in class the next day."Plus. I'm very lazy, so I'd rather write something while lying on bed."Jungkook laughs a little at what she had to say. She didn't speak a lot, but she was fun to be with. And the fact that he wasn't much of a speaker himself made the before-class greet the only time they even chatted.There were instances when he wasn't sure what he should say to her, and whenever a situation like that occurred, Jungkook brings of Yoongi, which immediately makes her smile."He wants to meet you, [Name]. What do you think?"This makes [Name] almost break the pencil she had in hand."Bias-nim wants to meet me?"Jungkook displays his set of bunny teeth in amusement. He knew that [Name] was a fangirl, and although he wasn't fond of excessive obsessing, he found it a little funny when he had earlier seen her squeal with her friend as she "discovered the perfect wallpaper of Yoongi-shi".Looks like he wasn't going to be her wallpaper any longer."Yes. You wrote part two, and he was very excited.""Wow."Jungkook was starting to get more and more confused about [Name]. She was a huge fangirl, but why wasn't she trying to get ways of meeting with her idols?"[Name], do you not want to meet him?""Of course I want to meet him! He is the love of my life, but..." Her voice trails off a little, and Jungkook watches the way she mumbles with her fingers. "But I can't.""Can't?""I'll make a fool out of myself. I don't want to embarrass myself in front of my bias." She explains. Jungkook's mouth forms a little 'o' as he nods his head with realisation."Well, I don't think Yoongi-shi is the type to judge that way. Besides, he really wants you to meet him."[Name] bites her lower lip in response, a little smile intact on her face.Jungkook couldn't understand why he felt so uneasy about the situation. Was it because Yoongi would be upset if he didn't manage to convince [Name] to meet him?Whatever it was, he was a little glad when she shakes her head.Jungkook shudders at what Yoongi's reaction would be.

"She said no?"The high-schooler nods in response, later that day. Yoongi looks disappointed, but that was all he did; sinking onto the sofa and letting out a deep breath."Did she say no to me using her lyrics?""Uh not really, just the not meeting part.""Dammit." The 23-year-old responds with a little grunt. Jungkook watches him crossing his arm on his chest, letting out a huff of air. Winter was coming soon, and the boy had fished out his favourite coat from one of his suitcases back at home. What he loved the most was the pocket inside, which was made out of soft wool.He sinks his hands deep into the pockets, smiling a little at the warmth.And when Jin calls everyone for dinner, Jungkook hurriedly stands up; taking large steps and walking away from Yoongi as fast as he could.Something was definitely up with him.   "What's your favourite song of ours, [Name]?"The girl raises an eyebrow, looking at Jungkook as if she thought he was crazy.He was, but not to the extent she probably thought he was."That's like asking to choose between water and air," She has to say, raising a finger. "I can't choose a specific one."Jungkook laughs at the analogy she had used to express that situation. The Korean dictionary that was placed in between the two was flipped open, ready to be used. Jungkook was starting to get used to being in the group that finished first, instead of last, like the past semester. He felt glad that [Name] took the initiative and asked him to be her partner.He was slowly starting to get used to waving a little hello to her every day, listening to what she had to say, and watch her slideshow of wallpapers, all of which featured his hyung.It was a little funny for him to see someone he was learning well, being such a huge fan of someone he had known for so long. He would laugh it off when she would play music in between classes.She thought he didn't hear, but her earphones were deceiving her big time.He heard, all right."Don't you get tired of listening to our music all the time?""If I could make music as amazing as you do, I wouldn't stop listening to it." [Name] says a witty response, and once again, Jungkook finds himself grinning, with his big smile plastered on.Jungkook also finds it hilarious, the look on [Name]'s face as she pouts during dance class. Even though she knew exactly what her steps were, her body wouldn't cooperate, and a sour expression is visible clearly on her face. This makes him wonder when on earth he started paying so much attention to other things in class. He really needed to handle the lyrics situation already. He found that he didn't really mind things the way it was, and he even offers [Name] a few minutes of separate practice after everyone else leaves.He felt a little embarrassed when he notices a few girls in class glancing at him in suspicion when the two stay back."Jungkook, how do you feel about being called 'Kookie'?"The boy was not expecting a question like that, so he raises an eyebrow, leaning against the wall a little. He takes a few seconds to consider what to say, while he watched [Name] tie her shoelaces."They say it matches my face. I don't really have an opinion, I'm okay with it." He lets her know.[Name] has a big grin on her face as she excuses herself for a minute. She runs to where her bag was lying on the floor, and pulls out a little packet."Catch!"A startled Jungkook manages to grab the packet, and when he does, [Name] appears in front of him, trying her hardest not to burst out laughing."It's a sugar cookie. Or should I say... Suga Kookie?""Oh, [Name]." He laughs, tearing one corner of the packet and biting into the cookie.It made Jungkook realise that all he and [Name] ever talked about were baseless things like this.Twenty minutes later, the two are dressed back into the uniforms. Since they were going together, Jungkook quietly lets [Name] know that he will see her out at the gate.It was the least he could do, after all, since he couldn't even give her a lift.As expected, the van is waiting for him to board it and rush to the studio. As he walked to the gate beside [Name], he realises that he missed walking a lot. In fact, wherever he wanted to go, he had a van or a limo with him at all costs.Sometimes, being a celebrity was hard.Upon reaching the door of the van, Jungkook turns to [Name], who is waving a little, towards him."See you tomorrow, in class!"He absolutely couldn't wait.   "You wrote another set for Yoongi-shi?"From the way [Name] shuts her book instantly, Jungkook didn't need three guesses to know what was in that book.Deciding not to pry further into her privacy, Jungkook blinks at the way she quickly packs her books."I'll... I'll put it into your locker, when I'm finished..." [Name] lets him know, stepping outside. Grabbing his own bookbag in hand, he follows her, shaking his head."Um, it's okay even if you don't do that, you can just give it to me."The girl shakes her head, her fringe spilling all over her face as she does. Slightly irritated, she used both hands to push away the hair over her face. There is a hint of a smile on Jungkook's face at the gesture, when she shakes her head again, this time a little softly."I'm also a fangirl, so I should do it the fangirl-style."By now, he was full well smiling.A girl from their class had debuted as a K-pop idol a couple days ago, and Jungkook was glad to see that the attention he would receive as he walked with [Name] had dropped a little.At least he could be normal at school.That's what he thought, before he sees the van ready to pick him up.Who was he kidding?"See you next Monday, [Name]." He says, rushing to the front of the vehicle. Before she could respond, the window of the van slides down, revealing mint green hair.Jungkook could exactly tell who it was, even before the man inside takes off his face mask.And from the way [Name] drops the bookbag she had been clutching in hand, he could tell that she recognised him too.

Min Yoongi.It is Yoongi, sitting in the driver's seat, glancing up at the startled-looking Jungkook with his lips pursed."Hyung... What are you doing here?"Yoongi shrugs a little in response, glancing to his back and taking a glance at the gateway of the school. He then notices the girl beside Jungkook, who had dropped her bag and had a hand over her mouth, hiding her shock.Without another look at her, with disinterest, he turns back to face Jungkook again."To see her. I think I'm a little late though, right?"This makes Jungkook gulp, turning to face [Name] a little. By then, she has somewhat gotten over her initial shock, picking up her bookbag and glancing at the younger boy."Did you tell him to come?" She whispers, which makes Jungkook shake his head in horror."I would never! Hyung, why-"Yoongi may be lazy, but even he could understand the situation, what actually was going on. With newfound interest, he looks at [Name] again, smiling a little before he spoke."Are you her? [Name]?"Yoongi didn't need a response to put two and two together. Pointing to the back seat, he speaks up again."Jungkook. [Name]. Get in the van."The younger boy had never seen Yoongi look so determined before, if it wasn't related to singing or writing music. He felt an uneasy feeling build up in his chest, as he shot a helpless glance at [Name]. Her face had turned light pink, and when Jungkook opens the back door of the vehicle, she gets inside, as told."Where are we going?""I'm going to drop you off to the studio, Jungkook," Yoongi responds, turning on the engine. "And then, if [Name] agrees to it, I'll be taking her out for dinner."Jungkook takes a nervous glance at [Name], who sat, hands resting on her lap as she gulps."Hyung... If... If she doesn't?""Then I'll drop her off home." By now, the vehicle was stopped at a red light, and Yoongi turns to face the girl."[Name], would you mind having dinner with me?"Both the boys are looking at the girl who looks like she is ready to stab herself. After a few seconds which seem like years, she shakes her head a little.Jungkook has a sour expression on his face as they drove off to the studio. He wasn't sure if she agreed because she wanted to, or because it would be rude to say no. He even felt that it was really unfair that Yoongi only gave her two options, and that he literally had [Name] cornered at that.Whatever it was, he bites his lower lip, unsure, as he gives a wave to [Name] after getting outside.Even black bean noodles they had received from the food truck today didn't seem to lift his spirits today.   Meanwhile, as Yoongi played soft rap music on the stereo, [Name] fumbled with her fingers, wondering what she could do or say."What do you like to eat, [Name]?" He calls from the front seat, startling her. She had never expected that the love of her life would speak to her, make references simply for her, or even talk to her with the deep, beautiful voice of his that she was all too familiar with and loved.She inhales as much of air as she could, before speaking up.There was no backing out now, after all."I like all kinds of food.""Good," Yoongi's reflection from the rear-view mirror shows a slight hint of smile, as he nods. "Shall we get some Japanese food?""Okay."The drive to the restaurant was a silent one; it reminded her of the small conversations she shared with Jungkook, where they barely spoke anything.But as she watched the way Yoongi puts on a beanie, and turns to face her while putting on his face mask, she feels her heart-throb.
He needs to stop being so beautiful, it hurts.
Putting on her bag over her shoulders, she steps outside, seeing a restaurant, dimly lit and surrounded by beautiful potted plants. Each plant had three pale pink roses at the top, and the little lanterns leading up to the sliding door made [Name] want to take out her phone and take a snap of the artistic setup.But as she glances at Yoongi, only his eyes were visible, that too somewhat hidden behind the pair of sunglasses he had on... It made her realise that if there was anything worth being called art, it was the boy walking inside the restaurant with her.Yoongi chooses a table near the register, away from the window. It made [Name] understand that he wanted to avoid by-passers, and the two sit down, facing each other.At least, until [Name] looks away a little in embarrassment.For her, Min Yoongi felt like a beautiful statue, even with his entire face covered by various props.And looking at how shy [Name] was behaving, the amused Yoongi takes off his sunglasses."Jungkook has a lot of adorable friends, doesn't he?"The girl looks back towards him, blinking a little while they chose some food. "No," She denies, lifting her gaze from her fingers, and into his eyes. "Jungkook is the adorable one."Yoongi nods in agreement, taking his phone out. A few seconds of flipping later, he shows the screen to [Name].It was a picture of Jungkook sleeping, hugging tightly onto a pillow. And to exaggerate the already-adorable picture of the boy, Yoongi does the honour of zooming into it, revealing the little drool that had started to escape from one corner of his lips."He's cute." Yoongi comments, putting his phone away. "Anyway, what do you study, [Name]?""Composing.""That's good. I really liked 'Taste'." He has to say. "Thank you for sending it to me.""Y-You're welcome." She pauses, when the waiter arrives with two plates of food. Taking the pair of chopsticks in hand, the two exchange a small smile before they begin eating.And while she does so, she tries to control her racing heart with millions of thoughts in her head.
He's only eating with me because he wants to use my lyrics.

Not because he likes spending time with me.

Obviously.
In fact, the thoughts running in her head finally explode, and she gets the guts to speak up."Why did you want to meet me, Yoongi-shi?""Selfish reasons." The rapper admits, picking up his bowl of soup. "You realise what I want, don't you?""I have some guesses.""I'm working on my second mixtape, [Name]. I want to add your song to it."The spoon in [Name]'s hand drops to her tray, making a loud clattering noise. She was aware of this information already, via Jungkook, but hearing it from Yoongi himself made it even more unbelievable.Which should actually be the other way around."And I want to work with you for a while. When do you graduate?" He queries. The girl nervously takes a sip of her tea, trying to analyse what was going on. She obviously hadn't thought any further than the fact that she wanted to compose songs for a living...And Min Yoongi was asking her to work with him?She needed a little while to respond back."Um... The same time as Jungkook will." "Would you be willing to work with me for a while?"[Name] feels her toes curling, and it wasn't just the effects of winter bothering her; she was genuinely shocked...
Jungshook, hehe.
She blinks in surprise at how Jungkook managed to pop into her head at a situation like this. It makes her giggle a little, much to the confusion of the rapper sitting in front of her."What is it?""Nothing, I just thought of something the army fandom made up."Yoongi rubs a finger on the tip of his nose as he smiles. He had always felt emotional at the response he received from his fans, the army, because he knew he wouldn't be who he was now if it wasn't for them."Thanks for the support, [Name]. It means a lot."The girl can only nod in response.From the way he didn't mention composing during the rest of the meal, she feels a little at ease; in fact, by the time the two finished and Yoongi puts his face mask back on before paying the bill - even after she insisted she paid, at least for her share - she couldn't help but pout at the taller boy.Yoongi only stares back at her, making her wonder if he didn't like the expression on her face. She gulps when the boy lowers his face mask enough for her to see his lips...And he was pouting just as much as she had been.The two giggle a little, and as she witnessed the 'gummy' smile of her bias, she realised how stupid it was that she refused to meet him at first.She couldn't wait to tell Jungkook about everything.

Jungkook felt restless.He stayed awake until 11 pm, and Yoongi was still not back home.Jimin took note of the younger boy's scrunched up face, as he brushed his teeth."It's been four hours! Why isn't hyung back?" The boy wants to know. Jimin can only offer a shrug in response. He didn't think it was such a big deal, that Yoongi was out with a girl, but he was certain that Jungkook would not want to hear that at the moment."He'll be back in a while, don't worry and get some rest. You have school- oh never mind, its Friday."Another frustrated groan is let out, and Jungkook couldn't get it out of his head, the expression on [Name]'s face when she looked at him and asked if he called Yoongi in the first place.How could she think that I'd do something like that?!But it was so ironic so I can't even blame her...With thoughts tapping on his head enough to make it physically hurt him, Jungkook steps out of the balcony.Jin was really worried about the younger boy's behavior, and as he is about to turn to Jimin to ask what was up, the door flies open.Min Yoongi steps in, nodding at Namjoon who greets him. It takes the boys until Yoongi takes his beanie off, to realise that his hair was no longer mint anymore.At the gasp, Jungkook turns around and faces the older boy."Hyung, where have you been?""I got my hair dyed, after dinner.""When did you drop [Name] off?""An hour after you left."The high-schooler blinks at the black-haired boy in surprise, realising how all this time, he had been worrying for nothing. He probably won't be mentioning this out loud though, and he prays that Jimin doesn't blurt it out."Why did you suddenly change it back to black?" Namjoon wants to know"I was just getting ready for our shoot tomorrow, that's all." Yoongi has to say, smiling. Sinking into the sofa and letting out a sigh, he pats the soft material beside him, motioning for Jungkook to sit next to him.Wondering what he wanted, Jungkook does as motioned, blinking in confusion. He reeked of alcohol."Hyung...""Don't worry, [Name] hasn't agreed to work with me yet.""Then... What did you talk about?" This news comes as a surprise to Jungkook. As far as he knew [Name], she didn't talk much if she didn't really have something to talk about. Even if what she chose to talk about was baseless. He wondered what on earth the two talked about, and Yoongi only gives a shrug in response."She's cute. She reminds of you a lot, it's eerie." The older male has to say, raising his feet onto the coffee table. At least, until Jin swats his feet away."So, Jungkook's friend and you got together about the lyrics?" The oldest male speaks, sitting beside the younger one. Both the boys nod in response, and Yoongi picks his phone from his pocket, showing a picture he had taken of [Name] - after he had dropped her off at home and clicked his phone before she could say anything.He had then left, with a quick goodbye, before she could protest."I gave her my phone number. She has till graduation to decide if she's fine with working with-" His sentence is broekn midway by hiccups, and for the first time that day, Taehyung looks up from game console in his hand, to see Jin hurry to take the intoxicated boy to his dorm room."He's back, let's head to sleep, maknae." Jimin's arm wraps around Jungkook's dragging the unsure boy up to his feet and back into his dorm room.As Jungkook lay on his bed and stared at the collection of figurines he had brought back from home, his head felt numb, so much that he couldn't think straight.Maybe giving the note to Yoongi was a very bad idea.   For the next six days, Jungkook didn't hear from [Name].For one, he had missed three days of class because he was busy shooting 'Blood, Sweat, and Tears'.And the other, it had never crossed his mind to ask for any of her contact numbers.Jungkook made a metal note to do so, as he walked to class on Thursday. He took out the notes stuffed to his locker - and he had a lot this time, because he was away for a while and also because he and his band members released thevideo just yesterday - all while he felt various glances boring into his back.Shaking his head while putting the bits of papers into his bag, he hurries to head to class.As usual, [Name] is early to class, had on her headphones in her favorite color, and was bobbing her head sideways - a sign that she was listening to some BTS music.Jungkook found himself smiling in a long while, when he walks upto his desk. Halfway to it, [Name] takes note of the boy, a big smile forming on her face as she did so."Hi.""Hello, [Name]. How have you been?""I'm good. I was so scared on Friday, I'm sorry for actling like such a loser."Jungkook shakes his head in shock, slipping into his seat as soon as he could."No! You didn't. Of course you'd be flustered when hyung showed up unannounced!"The girl has a goofy smile on her face, and even before she started, Jungkook knew what she was about to do.Tell him all about her day with Yoongi, that was what."And after we ate, we drove for a bit and he dropped me off. He is so easy to talk to, like you.""Ah, I'm easy to talk to?" He couldn't help but to interrupt. He was starting to pick up some habits from Taehyung, and enjoying receiving compliments."Yes you are. I don't get embarrassed while I talk to you." [Name] has to say, smiling. "Anyway, he let me take a picture of him."With that, the girl unlocks her phone, showing her wallpaper which was of Yoongi sitting in the driving seat, making a finger heart."You're really a huge army, aren't you?" Jungkook laughs a little at her enthusiasm."Of course. Blood, Sweat, and Tears was amazing, oh my god."Jungkook smiles a little, happy that she enjoyed the video. He still had a question bothering him, so he changes the subject again."Are you going to agree to working with Yoongi-shi?""Oh. I'm not sure yet... It's a great opportunity, I know, but...""But...?"[Name] gulps a little, wondering what the right word to say was. As she tapped on her phone screen while she thought about it, Jungkook takes a glance at the Korean dictionary placed on her table. It was opened midway, and there was a notepad underneath, a pen clipped to the top of it.
Was she writing lyrics again?
"He keeps me on my toes. It's a little hard for me to be with him, because I can't take my eyes off from him.""Oh, that makes sense." The boy blinks a little, running a hand through his hair - and being oblivious to the squeals by some girls behind him."Did you seriously not hear that?" [Name] wants to know, pointing a finger at the back. Jungkook turns around a little to see where she was pointing at, and sees the girls begin to fan themsleves and and their eyes go wide. One girl raises a hand, and when she calls out a little 'Jungkook-oppa!', the boy can only give a crooked smile in response before he flips back around."How embarrassing. I'm not an oppa." Jungkook mumbles under his breath."You don't like being called that, don't you?"The boy nods a little, burying his head on his arms, and letting out a loud sigh. "I wonder if Yoongi-shi would like being called oppa.""Please don't. I don't like that word, so I don't want to hear that."And even though he felt lousy, and uneasy at both what happened with his hyung earlier, and also with the girls just then...He couldn't help show his teeth as he laughed, along with [Name].

Bright purple clouds had started to dissolve onto the golden orange sky. The wind that blew roughly against the two that stood outside the gate was harsh enough to sway three thick locks of [Name]'s hair around.Her fringe was a mess.Now, this wasn't the first time this happened to her.She remembers when it happened to her when she was with Yoongi, and how she had quickly set her hair to place at the speed of light...Well, not exactly, but close.But as she stood beside Jungkook, she only manages to squint her eyes in annoyance.Even strands of Jungkook's hair were randomly brushing around, fluffy hair that [Name] wondered was soft to touch. While Jungkook waited beside her for his van to arrive, he couldn't take his eyes off from one thing.[Name].Her blowing air up to her fringe to get it off her face. The way her nose scrunches when a strand of hair sticks to her tongue, as she blew raspberries.All the while, Jungkook had his eyes on her, unless she glanced his way, in between.And when she did, the flustered male would look up at the sky instead.To him, it felt like someone had spilled a bottle of purple oil onto the sky and used a brush to sway the spills around. He loved the little crack lines between the purples and the orange layers, how well they blended together, all of that.He felt even more at peace when his gaze slowly drifted down to [Name]. From the way her feet would not stay still, he became aware that she was listening to a fast track of his own band.He was too curious to not ask her which.At this, the girl takes off one ear bud, offering him one. The maknae hesitates, tensing up a little while he slowly reaches for it. He bites his bottom lip as he inches a little closer to her to stop the cable from coming off.The music is familiar, and a few seconds later, he recognises the song."Boy in Luv?""I love this song," She responds, bobbing her head up as her shoulders moved around to the music. "One reason why you guys have so many fans in because you sing songs that girls wish boys would sing for them.""Ah," Jungkook's face goes a little red at the compliment, and he bows down a little, appreciating the comment. "Thank you."While the two tried to unsuccessfully rap the lines sung by Yoongi, they exchanged smiles, barely aware that the vehicle to pick up Jungkook arrived a while afterwards.Jungkook thought it was very unfair.Not because the vehicle came right then...But because [Name] wouldn't leave his head, even after he climbs onto the van and goes back to his dorms.He wondered if she thought about Yoongi just as much.   The next day, the teacher of Language class showed up with a pop quiz that made everyone scrunch their faces.It seemed like no one was very fond of this subject, but were forced to do it anyways."Good luck, Kookie!" [Name] offers a thumbs up. He was pretty sure that it wouldn't be of much help, but knowing that she was aware of that made him smile a little.He was used to being called various names similar to that, and yet, he felt his face turn red in embarrassment at that. He appreciated that she didn't call him names he hated; she had done enough of her homework as an army to avoid that.Reciprocating the gesture, he nods, seperating their desks and sitting individually. While the teacher passed the papers to the rest of the class, he waved his hand a little to catch her attention, giving a thumbs up back to her, and a bunny smile that did no less than melt her weak heart.Jungkook was too adorable, she wondered if he was aware of it.Meanwhile, oblivious to this, the maknae blinks at the set of questions on the cover sheet, taking a deep breath.Maybe this paper will be easier this time than last year's one.After an hour-long paper, [Name] gives a wave to the boy and goes to vocal classes with some of her friends. Jungkook wondered why she hadn't spoken about Yoongi all day, and even though he wanted to ask what was on her mind regarding the rapper, he didn't like the idea of asking her something she didn't want to talk about.It made him realise that he trusted her enough to know she would tell him about things that were important.After vocal classes ended, Jungkook heads to the cafeteria with multiple other friends of his. He liked the udon that the cafeteria served every Friday, and while he sat, slurping the soup that came along with his dish, he could see [Name] at a far corner, eating with her friends.She looked like she was eating dumplings, and for a split second, Jungkook wished he had taken the same dish as hers.For once, he wanted to eat with just her, no one else."I heard we're getting class participation marks today, in dance class." One of his friends has to say.Now, if there was one thing Jungkook was confident about, it was his dance skills. So he knew he would do alright.But when his eyes go wide and he turns to his friend for confirmation, the rest of his group watch him in suspicion."Are you sure?! It's today?""Yes, I head Sir talking to the supervisor on the phone about it.""Oh no!" Jungkook has a little frown on his face. He hurries to finish his meal as quickly as possible, so that he could tell [Name] about what was coming ahead."Jungkook?"The boy looks up from slurpling the contents of his bowl, to see the girl standing in front of him. Placing the bowl down, he quickly wipes the back of his palm over his mouth.What a wrong timing, he felt like he would explode from embarrassment."Yes, [Name]...?""We're getting graded today..."This snaps Jungkook out of his embarrssed state, and he nods. He knew exactly what she wanted him to do, and as he glanced around the table once before standing up, he saw that a couple of his friends were staring at the girl while the other two didn't even bother to look up from their hamburgers.Good.As the two walked out of the cafeteria in silence - enough silence to hear various whispering between people all over the cafeteria - they both were too flustered to speak until they stepped outside. Holding the straps of his bookbag on either side of his waist, he walks two steps behind [Name], waiting for her to say something."That was so embarrassing! I'm sorry, Kookie! I hope I'll never have to do that again." She says, her face still pink. When Jungkook takes a glance at her, he sees that she is holding out her smartphone towards him."May I ask for your number? So that... You know. I can text you instead of that..."Jungkook can only blink at the device in her hand in shock. He had been meaning to ask her for her own number, before, but he never got the chance.Oh, who was he kidding? He got plenty of chances, but he was either too shy to, or the teacher always showed up to class before he could bring it up."Ah, it's fine," She shakes her head, snapping Jungkook out of his thoughts. "Celebrities don't give out their phone numbers to other people much, right? I'm so stupid-"Before she could lower her phone, the young boy reaches for it, snatching it from her grasp and quickly punching the digits to his contact number. As he did so, [Name] looks up at the boy in surprise, seeing the smile on Jungkook's face when he saved his own number and hands it to her."You're my friend, don't be silly, [Name]."Jungkook still felt a little uneasy as the words of reassurance came out of his mouth. But shaking it away, he looks at [Name], who hurries to walk to the gym downstairs as fast as she could.It was impossible. He couldn't feel anything but happy when [Name] was around.

The fact that Jungkook helped [Name] practice before class became the talk of the school the next day.As soon as the boy stepped into class, before he could greet his friends - and of course, [Name], he is swarmed around by multiple girls who had been waiting for him to show up."Jungkook-oppa, are you and [Name] dating?""Kookie, you should be loyal to the army!!""When did [Name] and you become a couple?""Oppa, I love you more!"Even though the boy tried his best to calmly shake his head and filter his way into class, he was surrounded. Girls of all four grades had him cornered, and the poor boy's face has all colour drained out by the time security guards finally show up at the doorstep and push the girls away.When he finally lets out a sigh and gets in - after he thanks the saviour - his gaze flies to his desk, at which [Name] was sitting, her chin resting on her hand while she looked out of the window."Good morning."It is her that greets first, today, and the boy blinks a little in surprise, his usual bunny smile intact as he waves back."Hi, [Name], what are you listening to, today?"The girl has a big smile on her face, waiting for a couple seconds to sync the lyrics she sang with the music playing on her smartphone."Haruman~" She sings, dramatically raising a hand out towards the boy. As he noticed a couple of his friends from behind him chuckle at the action, he raises a hand to cover the bottom half of his face, flustered. Even then, he wasn't able to hide the fact that his smile grew as he hurried to slide into his seat beside her."I like that song. It's peaceful and it makes me happy.""You said the same about almost every song I asked you about." Jungkook has to point out.The two share a teeth-showing laugh at that.[Name] unlocks her phone, showing a picture she had come across online. As Jungkook blinked and checked out what it was that she was pointing at, his eyes fly wide."Oh no..."The picture was a snapshot someone had taken while the two was standing outside the gate. From the way they hadn't really stepped fully out of the school's borders, it was obvious that it was either a student, or a staff of the school who posted it initially."If I was to have my picture on the internet, I thought it would be with Yoongi-shi, not you." [Name] mumbles. Jungkook offers a weak smile in response, looking at the captions following them, some of it in English, making him press the translate button.It was no help. He felt just as violated as [Name] looked, and he apologises profusely, even when she shakes her head."It's fine! I mean, if I work with Yoongi, this will happen again, I'm just surprised." She explains, taking out her thick dictionary and placing it on her desk. The familiar book makes Jungkook feel a little relaxed - or was it her reassurance? - and he sighs, taking out his notebook."So, will you? Work with hyung?""I really don't have any reason to say no..." She thinks, cupping her hands on her cheeks as she gave some thought. "What do you think?""Um," He didn't mean to be rude, but his initial response is to scrunch his face at the thought. He was glad that [Name] missed that reaction, and he shakes his head. "I think... If you want, it's good. You're very talented, [Name]."The girl offers him a bright smile which shows her dimples.It was at that moment that he understands why people loved Hoseok's dimples so much.   The band was ready for a fansign event later that event. Jungkook has a regretful expression on his face when he has to step out of his school uniform and get dressed for the event right away."Are you okay, Maknae?" Jimin wants to know, as they got into the event arena. Jungkook gives a nod to his hyung, letting out a sigh of relief. As soon as he gets seated - between Taehyung and Yoongi - he feels his smartphone vibrate in his pocket. Taehyung is peering over Jungkook's shoulder, grinning and saying a loud 'Oooooohhhh', enough to make the rest of the members hear him. While the youngest one tried to hush him and press the text notification displaying [Name]'s contact name, he can only raise an eyebrow in confusion.
 'So call me, baepsae.' 
"She's a die-hard army, isn't she?" Taehyung has to comment, giggling to himself."There must be a reason why she sent me this, she doesn't do useless things..." Jungkook's thoughts are interrupted when he hears some of the fans from the front singing.
Singing baepesae.
Jungkook's jaw drops open when one of the girls wearing a flower crown on her head, and was singing, was none other than [Name]."Jungkookie?"Even though he wanted to go talk to her, or even text her in response, the fan signing had begun, he was asked to put his smartphone away.Every chance he got, he couldn't take his eyes away from the girl who moved one seat with ever passing fan. It made him amused, how different she behaved in class and when she fangirled so much. In between, he had managed to tell Taehyung the reason why he was suddenly nervous.The mischievous boy raises an eyebrow in confusion, glancing to [Name] who was currently seated in front of Jin.Shaking his head, Jungkook clears his mind, focusing on the fan in front of him. As she passed from Namjoon and Jimin, his focus darts to her again. She was sitting in front of J-Hope now, and the next thing he sees is her bursting out laughing harder than he had ever seen her do so before. He wondered what his hyung said to make her laugh so much, and when the fan in front of him passes by - excited when Taehyung offers her a hand-wrestling match - Yoongi leans a little closer to Jungkook."Are my eyes deceiving me, or is that [Name]?""I've been asking myself that the entire time." The younger boy responds, and right then, [Name] semi-waddles her way to Yoongi."Hello."While she felt embarrassed by the way Yoongi leans close to her - close enough to make her flinch a little back; plus also making Jungkook let out a small huff - she didn't really mind this time. It was a fan-signing event, where she would not be the only crazy person."You haven't texted me." Yoongi has to say, opening the album photo book and flipping the pages to the post-it with his name on it."I'm still thinking..."Yoongi takes a few seconds to read the question [Name] had written out for him, bursting out laughing when he finishes. Jungkook tries his best to focus on his fan, who had requested to hold his hand while he answered the question he had written himself."A ship name for you and me, huh?" Yoongi asks, lifting his hand and extending it towards her. [Name] hesitates but reluctantly puts her hand on his, and the rapper intertwines their fingers while he scribbled on the book."You're not the [Name] I had dinner with a few weeks ago, right now.""Please don't say that, Oppa." The girl covers her face with her free hand, flustered by being in such close contact with her bias. Beside them, Jungkook cringes at the word she used to refer to his hyung, aggressively drawing a big heart on the post-it note that his respective fan had pasted on the book."What the fuck, [Name]," Yoongi is unable to hold himself from cursing, his gummy smile on as his hold on her hand tightens. "Look what you're making me say.""Oppa, please answer the next question.""No. You'll need to text me back first," Yoongi says, his expression blank now, as he notices that the fan in front of Jungkook passes by to Taehyung again. "Now go away.""That's mean. Give me five more seconds," She has to say, reaching for a bag that they had just only noticed she had been carrying, beside her. To both the male's - and even Taehyung's, to some extent - shock, she takes a bouquet of flowers from this bag, handing it to Yoongi... Who can only blink, dumbfounded, as he accepts the gift."What do you expect me to do? Huh?" He asks, pulling at one of the roses from the bouquet. While she looks at him in surprise, Yoongi holds out the rose to her, making her jaw drop.Yoongi literally oozed from swag, she couldn't take it.While this was true, she is still giggling to herself when she sees the amused expression on the older male's face. Taking the rose he hands, she then makes her way to next in line, the maknae.Jungkook blinks at her, unamused when she sits in front him next. He wasn't even sure if he wanted to speak to [Name] right then, and all he wanted to do was slam his head against a gong and cringe till he passed out.But as fast as he reacted to the word 'Oppa', his eyes go wider than before when [Name] takes off the flower crown over her head and places it on his. "Wh-What? [Name]?!" He stutters, hands reaching for what was on his head now."Smile for the cameras, I'll need to download your adorable pictures later for my lockscreen."It wasn't fair.It wasn't fair, the way his pursed lips from before broke into a smile so big, the flashing of the cameras from behind started instantly.[Name] was so unfair, but he couldn't get himself to hate it.

Jungkook was not able to sleep well that night.For one, his hyungs were being very loud, opening up presents they got from their fans at the fan sign earlier.And the other... He wasn't sure of that part.Either way, he gets out of his dorm room when the older ones don't tone down even after it strikes 11 pm."Kookieeeee!" Hoseok is the one to greet him. The rapper is taking a box out of his oversized plastic bag that had all the gifts he received, and Jungkook glances over to Yoongi, who was bobbing his head while he listened to music and dug around his own bag."Jungkook, look at this," He speaks, taking out the all too familiar bouquet of roses from his side."Yes. I saw it.""No, you didn't."Jungkook squints his eyes at the rapper as he sits down beside him."Are you trying to provoke me?"Jin and Hoseok gasps.Namjoon and Hoseok were too busy listening to music to hear what Jungkook had said.Taehyung looks confused, and Yoongi looks at the younger boy in surprise, blinking. He then reaches to the bouquet and picks out a note inside."This you didn't see."Jungkook has an alarmed look on his face as he reaches for the note. He was even more alarmed when he notices that that note is yet another half of a song, which remained unnamed. Yoongi has a little grin on his face when Jungkook's eyes dart down to the note at the bottom.
'Thank you for the rose, Yoongi-oppa~ ♡'
Jungkook cringed even before he knew it was from [Name]."S-Sorry, hyung... I didn't mean to sound mad...""It's fine. But god damn this girl. She really needs to give me an answer."Taehyung eyes the younger maknae while he nervously shifted in his seat. Jungkook sighs a little, thanking Namjoon who hands the boy's plastic bag."What's going to happen if she says yes? Are you going to take responsibility for her when on tour, Hyung?" Jimin queries, turning to face Yoongi. The rapper replies with a shake of his head, as he takes the note from Jungkook's clutches.
Responsibility? You don't even know two things about her! Don't assume she wants to be taken care of that way...
Jungkook really needed some sleep to drive away the thoughts in his head.Instead, he reaches for his bag, looking around until he sees the flower crown which catches his eyes the most.[Name] had made it herself, every gift she had handed to the boys was made by herself, full of love. Jungkook wasn't that much of a fan of flower crown, himself, but he had to admit that [Name]'s work was beautiful.He missed her excited smile, and he couldn't wait to talk to her tomorrow.He was very disappointed when the rest of the members besides Taehyung and Yoongi did not remember [Name] particularly, even when Yoongi shows them the picture of her that he had taken. He feels himself clench his fists - what if [Name] didn't like her picture to be shown to people?"Alright, we have to wake up early tomorrow if we want to go have beef stew for breakfast tomorrow. Let's hurry to bed."Jungkook took the flower crown to his room that night.   "I am so sorry!!"Jungkook is greeted by a huge bow by [Name] the next morning. As he panicked about what was wrong, he sees that the girl is somewhat teary-eyed as she looked up at him."Wah. I'm worse than a drunkard when I fangirl! I can't believe I did all that!"Realising what she was freaking out over made Jungkook unable to hide his big grin."Now you're worried?""I called you cute. How embarrassing!"The boy's smile grows as he hurries to sit down at his desk. "It's alright, [Name], I like compliments.""I called Hoseok-ah my 'Sunshine Prince'. It's the truth, but that doesn't make it okay."This makes Jungkook chuckle when he sees the sweat that had formed on her forehead while she panicked.He felt like he was going to explode, [Name] was the cuter one."I sang baepsae with Taehyung-ah. What even.""I heard." He has to respond."Please kill me. That was the most amazing experience ever, but I totally ruined my first impressions. I felt so nervous but I was determined to act how I feel..."The quiet [Name] sure had a lot to say today."Guwah. Jin-ah ate all the cookies I made for him in one mouthful. He said it was good but I'm sure he's lying.""Well, I can't be sure about that since you didn't give me any.""You're already a Kookie, why would you need more?"The two bursts out laughing together.It was so simple, a lame, common joke.But they couldn't help it.   During dance class, [Name] accidentally elbows Jungkook so hard into his waist, that he falls on his bottom with a loud yelp."Oh my god! I'm so sorry!" The girl looks horrified, when she sees the younger boy wince in pain."It's fine..."One of the choreographers rushes to stop the music, and two of the friends at the back, who had witnessed the entire scene unfold, hurries to help Jungkook up."You okay?""No..." The boy croaks, earning a miserable look on [Name]'s face. She turns to face the head choreographer, raising a hand."I'm sorry! I'll take him to the infirmary...""You seriously need to pick up your game, [Name], but yes. Go do that."Jungkook tries to tell her it was fine as she continued to apologise for the entire way down the staircase. He was still holding onto his waist in pain, and [Name] hurries to drape his arm over her shoulder for support."Oh God, Kookie. I keep messing up.""It's fine, please stop apologising!" Jungkook whines a little, as he flinched at her contact. He had always felt awkward when girls were too close to him, and he blamed the fact that he was too busy with shooting and tours to actually have the kind of high school life that his friends had.He was in pain, so he tries his best to gulp away the nervousness he felt.At the infirmary, the nurse hands him some painkillers, which he takes and leans against the bedpost as he rested.There was silence between the two, and Jungkook wondered if he should speak up."Uh...""I'm so sorry for saying this.... But thanks for getting me out of dance class.""Oh, [Name], there's no stopping you." The boy laughs, hugging his legs tightly while he looked at the way her shoulders were rising from laughing. "Ah, did you know? Yesterday, one fan gave me three volumes of my favourite manga.""That's so cool! You're so lucky..."Jungkook shakes his head in response, biting his lower lip while eyeing her. He then notices something written on her palm, and squints his eyes."[Name], you have something on your hand...""Ah... Jin-senpai drew this!" She says, excitedly showing off the little heart he had drawn on her hand."Jin... Senpai?" This makes Jungkook raise an eyebrow in surprise, and [Name] has a distant look on her face."You don't like it when we call you Oppa... How about Senpai?""That's... Literally the same thing.""But do you hate it?"The boy shrugs in response, which brings a very determined expression on her face."I'm going to call you Jungkook-senpai from now on."This makes his jaw drop open, while he looks at the way she is smiling at him.It felt a little cringey too, and yet, at that second, all he felt was thankful.Thankful that he had taken Japanese and English language courses for high school.He was so thankful to have met [Name].

As the days passed on, Jungkook started to become more and more busy.He had more tours.More fan signs.More practice, and more shooting.And yet, the boy, who had been wishing for graduation already, feels slightly conflicted, as the date nears on. Three days of missed class pass by before manages to show up to school."Good morning, [Name]." The boy greets, slipping onto his seat. "We graduate in three days.""I'm so excited.""Me too!" A big smile forms on his face at the mutual excitement. He was definitely going to miss the friends he made here, some of whom had already debuted just like he had."Isn't it weird? You and I are partners in this class but I still barely know anything about you, Jungkookie." She has to say. The boy nods in response, he felt the exact same way.He did, but..."It's even more weird that I know little about you but you're still an important person to me.""Aww," [Name] couldn't help herself, raising both her hands to cover her face. "Thank you. You are, too.""Oh..." A small chuckle escapes from between his lips, before the girl shakes her head."Ah, let's skip this part. No need to get emotional, we're gonna do that at graduation anyways."Jungkook gives a warm smile in response.Of course, he was going to, he was so excited to graduate, for sure, but he felt extremely emotional already.Is this really how everyone felt?   "Well, I think it's clear what her answer is," Yoongi has to say, while he sleepily blinks at the noise Jungkook was making.This was probably the only reason why he didn't like sharing a room with the younger boy. He had school, and he would always wake early in the morning and create a fuss before he left.Luckily, now that he was graduating, Yoongi wouldn't have to deal with all that anymore.It takes Jungkook a few seconds to realise what his hyung was referring to."Ah, [Name]...""I gave her till graduation. Oh well."Yoongi doesn't seem to be very bothered by this fact. In fact, he looked more annoyed with the noise Jungkook was making, cursing quietly until the younger boy left.Jungkook takes in a deep inhale, he did feel slightly uneasy about not meeting his good friends, but he knew it wasn't the end, as long as he made sure it wasn't.Which was why, he had a big smile on his face as he greets the camera crew who was ready to shoot his graduation ceremony to be uploaded for their fans.His teacher was waiting for him and a few others, who were a little late. Jungkook's camera crew and fansite photo shooters were not the only ones who swarmed around the halls. He wasn't the only celebrity in the graduating class, after all.While his teacher lined the students in order, Jungkook finally manages to see [Name]. He notices that her hair was very neatly combed and she had a little makeup on her face. His glance manages to catch her attention, and he looks away as soon as she glances back at him. He feels himself tense a little, and he shakes his head, trying to waver away the feeling.His hyungs hadn't shown up even when he walks into the graduation hall. He feels a little sad when he doesn't see them, but he catches the attention of [Name], who sat a few seats in front of him, and was waving back at him. Unsure of how exactly he should reply, he gives a feeble nod, awkwardly taking his phone out to send her a text instead.
'This is it.'
The response he receives makes him freeze up.
'I know you're here with a lot of camera crews and everything, but can we speak, for a little bit, when we finish? Without everyone else seeing us?'
What on earth could she want from him?
 'Okay.' 
His bandmates hadn't shown up by the time he had to line up to head up the stage. He felt a little sick by then, especially as he worried about what [Name] wanted to tell him.But the faded colour of his face appears instantly, when his name is announced. He couldn't hide the big smile on his face as he walked to receive his diploma, and when he realised that he was also awarded an Achievement award for his debut, he smiled so hard that his cheeks even hurt later, as he walked off the stage.When he receives a text later, from [Name] again, he feels slightly nervous. Before he can respond, he hears loud squealing from girls at the back, and when he turns to face them, he sees his bandmates appear. The chaos of a pop sensation appearing brings deafening shouts, and Jungkook finds himself laughing a little while he watches them getting held back to take pictures.He slowly walks his way into the picture, showing a peace-sign and joining them."Sorry, Jungkook-ah, we got a little late.""It's okay, hyungs!" The boy is obviously excited, he had even finished taking multiple pictures with his diploma file in hand. He felt happy as he saw the familiar faces of his closest friends, and he couldn't wait to treat them to dinner like he had promised earlier."I have to meet a friend to say goodbye. Can I come back in five minutes?" Jungkook asks for permission, after a while. By then, most of the photo-shooters were focusing on the band members, since they had already taken a lot of the graduate anyways.Yoongi and Namjoon give their nods in approval, and Jimin asks him to come back soon, while Taehyung - much to Jungkook's embarrassment - gives a big wink and a suggestive smile.As planned, the boy walks up to the staircase, and sees [Name] leaning against the wall, waving to greet him."Hi, Kookie." She calls, making Jungkook nod."Well. It's over.""Yeah. No more language class.""No more of you carrying your Korean dictionary." Jungkook manages to joke, which makes [Name] giggle. He feels a little sad as he looks at her, and he holds a hand out to her, expecting a handshake in response.[Name] only blinks at his hand."I think we're close enough friends to exchange a hug, what do you think?"Jungkook tilts his head a little while his eyes go wide. Biting his lower lip, he takes a deep breath, awkwardly opening up his arms out.Even though he felt the same way, he felt too embarrassed to initiate something like that. What if she didn't like that? What if she thinks I'm weird? Those were things running in his mind before she said that, and the moment [Name] wraps her arms around his neck, his eyes go even wider.A waft of her perfume makes him crinkle his nose at first, softening down when he recognises the fruity flavour of the smell.It was nice.He felt a little awkward while he wraps his own arms around the girl's back, his face burying into her hair. It hit him then, how much he was going to miss [Name]'s company.His hold on her tightens, making [Name] lift up her head in confusion."Kookie?""Thank you, [Name]." He says between his bunny teeth. Unbeknownst to him, [Name] melts, she couldn't handle how cute Jungkook was, and seeing him up so close was a hundred times more softening to her heart more than she could take it."You're going to do your thank you speech to me like this?"At that, the boy awkwardly lets go of her, moving away - or at least, trying to. [Name] hadn't let go yet."This is embarrassing, but thank you so much, Jeon Jungkook. I had the best semester of high school here thanks to you."The younger boy's hands awkwardly rested on either side of his body, while he wondered how he should react. Should he hug her again? Why wasn't she letting go of him?"I feel so emotional right now, but really. Thank you. For helping me out a lot. For all the times we laughed. For not judging me for being obsessed with you, and your band."Jungkook feels colour rushing to his face, and in his attempt to hide that, he hurries to wrap his arms around [Name] again, looking up at the ceiling lights that illuminated the entire hallway."Ah?""I should be the one thanking you, [Last Name] [First Name]." He whispers, biting his lower lip. This was the second time he felt an emotional attack, the first time being when he first saw his hyungs waving to him from outside. While he took a deep breath, he notices her hands loose from around his neck, focusing now on either side of his blazer.He tried not to let that distract him from what he wanted to say."Thank you, [Name]," He pauses, wondering else he could tell her."Kook-""You made me glad that I skipped a year before I joined here. If I didn't, I would have graduated earlier and had never met you.""Oh, you're right... I'm a year younger than you, aw."Jungkook eases a little, looking down to face her as the two laughed a little."I'm glad to have met you too, Jungkook." She says."Mmhmm, you're one of the few friends who I will never forget." He responds, his grin widening. [Name] laughs a little, taking her hands off from his blazer and taking a step back. Jungkook lets go of her, and watches the way she shakes her head."Thank you, now go before someone sees us and cooks up another story of us which both of us don't need." She jokes, patting her hair a little. Jungkook gives her a small laugh in response, nodding a little."What?""I just realised that I won't be seeing you for a while. We should keep in touch." The boy admits shyly."Don't talk like we're going to die, Kookie," She says, her hands crossed behind her back, "We're going to see each other a lot in the future.""How c-""Because I sent Yoongi-shi a message and accepted his offer before I got my graduation scroll."

"What?"Jungkook's voice echoes through the hallway. He feels his heart becoming slightly heavy as he watched [Name] giving a small nod in response."Well, it took me a long time to decide, but I think Yoongi-shi knew that my answer was obvious." She explains. Jungkook gives a nod in, raising a hand to his mouth to cover the bottom half of his face."Um, okay. I'll see you later, then..." He mumbles, taking a few steps back. As realisation dawns in, he feels his forehead forming sweat, and he suddenly becomes very embarrassed over what happened with [Name] earlier."Hyungs are waiting for me." He quicky says, taking quick steps and hurrying down the staircase. [Name] does not follow, and he was pretty sure that she didn't want the two of them to go downstairs together and get the attention of one of the paparazzis.Of course, Jungkook knew that [Name] would say yes. Of course, it was obvious, Yoongi was her bias, after all. And it was in the field of what she wanted to do, there was no way she would have said no.But the fact that she had not responded for so long actually made him relieved, and he had almost forgotten about it, as well.As he walked down and saw his hyungs still busy with photoshoots, he shakes his head. Now wasn't the time to think about [Name].Jimin eyes the boy for a few seconds, before he returns back to the photographers.   The meal with Jungkook's hyungs was a memorable one. He always had a good time with them, and recreating what they did three years ago was fun, too. After paying a heavy bill out of his own pocket, Jungkook steps outside, taking in a deep breath of fresh air. He had a lot of questions he wanted to ask from Yoongi, but the older one has a very sleepy expression on his face while he yawns."Let's head back.""There's the van, let's go.""Nah, I have to go out somewhere, go on without me."All eyes land on the person who had said that, and even Taehyung looks a little surprised that it was Yoongi, who had said so."Where?""I'm meeting a friend." He responds. Instantly, Jungkook is reminded of [Name], and he bites his bottom lip, unable to hold himself."Are you going to meet [Name], hyung?""Looks like she told you." Yoongi has a smile on his face, as he fishes for his face mask from his pocket. "Yeah, her.""Wait, but what are you-" Jin's query is broken midway when Yoongi gives a wave and walks off. All eyes are now on Jungkook, and even the boy is shocked as he watches his hyung walk away. Before turning to take the corner, Yoongi turns around, calling out to the boy before he walked off."Jungkook, wanna come along with me?"His silence makes Yoongi shrug, putting his mask on and walking off."This was supposed to be a happy day..." Hoseok mumbles silently, making Jin speak up."Jungkookie, you have a little explanation to do."Namjoon elbows the eldest a little, but Jin does not seem bothered and goes on."And like, instead of pouting like that, you need to admit out loud that you're actually in lo-"Jin isn't able to complete his sentence, because Namjoon elbows him again, this time enough for him to let out a big gasp. Confused, Jungkook just blinks, requesting to head back home.   Yoongi is drunk when he returns later that night.Jungkook had been reading manga, which he closes as soon as the hyung steps inside."Hyung, why do you drink whenever you go somewhere with [Name]?""I always drink, Jungkook." He responds, falling onto his bed and sighing loudly. The young one eyes his elder, wondering what he could say to ask about his day."What do you want as a graduation present?"The sudden question surprises Jungkook, and he glances at the ravenette in disbelief."I'm... I don't really know...""Well, if you know something you need, tell me. I'll get it for you."Yoongi was in a very good mood, and Jungkook feels a little uneasy with the positive responses he was getting. They make a deal that Jungkook would tell what he wants later, after he gives some deep thought about it."Um, so, [Name] agreed... Are you happy, hyung?""Of course I am," Yoongi pauses, as he hiccups a little. "[Name] is great."
Of course she is.
"It bothers me that she's so much like you. Its like you both are twins that I need to raise.""Please don't classify the two of us as siblings," Jungkook laughs, sitting up and crossing his legs. He really did love being around this hyung of his a lot. Yoongi was the 'mysterious' type, but he wasn't cold, like the media has an image of him.He just didn't like expressing his feelings that much in the media, that was all.Jungkook also had to admit it. He loved having Yoongi as his dormmate, and he had a lot of respect for the rapper.Yoongi tosses his phone to Jungkook, telling the digits of the password to him while he did so."Go to audio recordings. Play the latest one."It takes a few taps for Jungkook to reach the folder, and while listening, he recognizes the person rapping is Yoongi himself."The date says this evening..?""I tried making some tunes for what [Name] gave me today.""Today?""Yeah," Yoongi responds, covering his body with the blanket. "Since you graduated, she said she isn't gonna bother you like she did before, of course.""She wasn't bothering me...""She gave me the note directly, today. I can't wait to recommend her to the director."The lyrics written on the note was arranged beautifully, and Jungkook noticed the familiar handwriting instantly."She'll join BigHit too?""Possibly. And if they don't let her, I'm going to personally hire her. She's good at English too, so it's like scoring two bricks with one stone."Jungkook wanted to protest against how offensive that may sound to [Name] if she was around, but he manages to toss the thought away.The world of business was really cruel, and if there was anyone who knew that then that was Jungkook himself.So how could he explain how disappointed he was feeling?

Yoongi's hangover the next morning is unbearable.In fact, he croaks for Jungkook to help him up, to get something to eat.The younger boy has a worried expression on his face while the two walk out to the living room. Taehyung is seated, playing a video game while Hoseok sits beside him, watching the way the former fails."We leave for shooting in eight hours," Namjoon announces, as he brought the bags of packed food. "And Suga, you look like you could use some medicine.""Thanks." He manages to respond, slipping onto the sofa lazily. While Jin hurries to take the food and digs in before it is distributed to the others - which wasn't really that new, actually - Jimin continues to eye Jungkook, an eyebrow raised as he watched the younger one fidget a little with the tray of food on his lap.Yoongi is quiet during his entire meal, which was rare since he always had to point out that the others were holding the plate 'wrong'. "If we still have eight hours, does that mean we can fit in a quick meeting? I want you to meet someone."The level of noise between the seven dies down instantly, all eyes on Yoongi, who had spoken up."Hyung...?""Yeah, Jungkook, they need to meet [Name] first, before we sign our contract together, right?" Yoongi wants to know, glancing at him. The boy blinks a couple times, placing his bowl of soup on the table and nodding a little."Yeah, I guess so. So like, when?""Are you guys fine with that?" The rapper wants to know, glancing at the rest of the others. Taehyung and Jimin hesitates a little, but when the others give nods and begin talking about how they thought [Name] would look like, the two give nods as well."Then, Jungkookie, call her and ask her to come here.""Why me?""Because you're her friend, obviously." Yoongi is looking at Jungkook as if he couldn't believe the boy was dumb enough to figure out the answer himself.The glances boring into his back by Taehyung and Jimin makes Jungkook shake his head, standing up."I don't want to call her, hyung. You do it." The boy has to say, picking up the plates. "Jimin hyung, it's our turn to take away the trash."As he hurried to take the plates, he could feel Yoongi give him a perplexed expression. Wavering it off, he follows Jimin - who had gotten up as soon as Jungkook had asked him to."Why don't you admit it, Jungkookie?" Another voice has to say, and the two turn around to see Taehyung catching up with the two."Admit what?" The boy wants to know, confused while he throws away the garbage bag into the trash can. Jimin tosses his bag away, wiping his hand on the front of his shirt, before he facepalms.Jimin had been holding in a lot of things, apparently."Jungkookie falls in love, but he has no idea." Taehyung laughs, raising a hand to high-five Jimin. At this, Jungkook's jaw drops open, watching the two continue laughing and closing the lid of the can.For a second, he felt like he lost the ability to blink even, he was that startled.And then, he begins to shake his head furiously."What? No! You've got it all wrong, hyungs!" He protests, crossing his arms and forming an 'X'. "It's just, [Name] isn't the way you think she is, I'm really worried about her.""The reason you're worrying about her is that you're in lov-""Please stop saying that." Jungkook interrupts. At that, the smile on Taehyung and Jimin's face clears away, and they exchange a glance."Jungkook-ah..."Taehyung has a pained expression on his face when he watches Jungkook walk away. But the thought crosses his head that Jungkook would be feeling even worse, and this makes him grab hold of the younger boy, turning him around."Hyung?!""Well, tell us. How is she different, the way you claim?"Jungkook can feel his heart racing at the thought, trying his hardest control himself. He wondered if he was getting a fever, and he brushes Taehyung's hold off from him and takes a step back."She isn't like that... She's a fangirl, but she's sweet. She respects me. And that's a lot more than I see from a lot of people. She is obsessed with us, and she is crazily in love with Yoongi-hyung.""But that's not the kind of love we're talking about here, Jungkook-ah-""And I want her to work with Hyung because she really wants to, not just because she loves him a lot, but also because she's good at it, she's worth it, and she wants to. She's happy that way, I just want her to be careful."Jungkook himself couldn't believe the words escaping from his lips. He had never once doubted on what Yoongi would do, because he always trusted him and knew that he was the mature and most caring person among the lot.But whenever [Name] came up, he felt his heart clench, and he was pretty sure it was because he knew her personally.
That's wrong, I'm not in love with her...
This time, when Jungkook walks off, no one has the heart to stop him.   "Yoongi, she's buzzing downstairs. Go bring her up." Jin informs, three hours later. The rapper who had been lazily lying on the sofa lifts his head up a little, glancing to where Jungkook sat, playing games...At least, till Jin said so."Jungkook-""I'm not going to go to bring her up. You do it, she's your responsibility." Jungkook's voice is a little louder than he had wanted to, and Yoongi can only give a shocked glance. He simply could not understand what was going on, any more than Jungkook himself could. Jimin has a defeated expression on his face as he watched Yoongi put on his shoes and step outside."Hyung is still a bit drunk, someone else should really go with him..."At that, an excited Hoseok volunteers, raising a hand before he gets on his feet to go."Jungkook, do you not like [Name]?" Namjoon wants to know, after he leaves.  At that, Jungkook hurries to raise his head, shaking it like he couldn't believe that the leader could even think that was possible."Of course not! She's my friend, she's my very good friend. I really, really like her. She makes me feel myself a lot, I'm sure you hyungs would like her too and understand why I tell you she's special."Jin only shrugs in response, as he eats some popcorn.Internally, Jimin was dying to point out that Jungkook was unaware of how he was feeling, and that if he took out the time to consider it, he'd feel it too.But from the way Jungkook was pressing the buttons on his game console, Jimin was sure he would not want to hear that, at that moment.And as the 'game over' pop-up appears on his console, Jungkook wonders what kind of a hello he should greet [Name] with, when he saw her.

 Jungkook was in distress.He was slightly aware that it wasn't just because he lost his game level for the second time in a row, and he lowers his game console, using a finger to even out his fringe. He had even asked Jin for a couple breath mints, and the worried expression on Jimin's face didn't budge.Taehyung had either forgotten all about it or he was pretending to; he was busily absorbed into his game again.It was quite a cold day, and Jungkook shudders a little, standing up to head to his dorm room."Kookie, where are you-""Just to get my sweater," He responds, his lips trembling slightly as he walked to the hallway.Meanwhile, [Name] stands in front of the silver gate, waiting for it to open up. The tips of her ears had gone red, and the earmuffs and four layers of clothing she had on weren't helping much.And this was when she already felt so warm inside from the excitement and slight embarrassment of meeting the boys once again.A loud 'ding' is heard, and she watches the way the door of the lift opens, revealing Yoongi and Hoseok, leaning against the back."Hey," Yoongi greets, raising a hand. The girl blinks a little, a small smile on her face while she nods. Hoseok is the one who presses a finger on the scanner, and the gate opens up, the heavy noise of metal moving making the three silent for a while. And then, Yoongi takes hold of the corner of her coat, and pulls her into the lift.[Name] has a startled expression on her face, but recovers quickly when the gate appears again. The lift closes, and she can feel it rising up."Hoseok, this is [Name]." Yoongi explains, letting go of her coat. "[Name], this is your hope."This makes [Name]'s face red, and she regrets ever fangirling in front of the older one.Hoseok does not seem bothered by the comment. In fact, he has a big smile on his face while he gives a big wave, and this does no less than to make [Name]'s heart ease a little. Hoseok was just as adorable as Jungkook, she felt like she'd die."I think I've seen you before, but I don't remember when..."This makes [Name] perk up a little. She can feel her face redden even more, and she wanted to bury herself under ten feet of concrete.
Hobi must never remember that I called him my sunshine prince... Never, ever...
"You're friends with Jungkookie, right?" Hoseok wants to know, instead. The girl smiles at the mention, nodding her head. She was excited to see Jungkook again, and it was a little funny for her that she was seeing him so soon after graduation."What's that in your hand?" Yoongi wants to know, pointing to the paper bag in her hand. This makes her squint her eyes a little. The more time she spent with Yoongi, the more she realised that he enjoyed butting into things, and she starting to get used to being around him, too."I made something for Bangtan." She responds.Hoseok lets out an 'ooooh', the loud ding of the lift stopping upon reaching making him stop abruptly. The door opens, and the boy steps out, and Yoongi waits for [Name] to step out before he follows.Taehyung is the first person to give a reaction, letting out a loud 'OH!' as soon as he sees her.He was the only person who recognised her instantly, after all.And when Taehyung begins to sing Baepsae, [Name] covers her face, flustered. The others get up, huddling around to greet the girl with warm smiles that made her melt at once."Guys, [Name]. And [Name], this is-""BTS." Everyone responds. This makes her laugh a little, before she looks around.Jungkook is nowhere to be found."Where is Kookie?" She asks. This makes Jimin and Taehyung exchange a glance nervously."I'll go bring him." Yoongi has to say, glancing at Hoseok. "Make her feel at home."Walking along the hallway and into their dorm room, Yoongi finds Jungkook sitting at the end of the cupboard, drawers opened out as he searched frantically for something."Jungkook?""Hyung, I can't find my sweater," The boy calls, while Yoongi sits on the bed beside him."[Name]'s here, let's go. We'll turn up the radiator.""Oh...""I think it's at the laundry's," Yoongi explains, standing up. Jungkook looks a little unsure, but he gets up anyways."Let's go, and greet her properly. I don't know what is wrong with you two.""There's nothing wrong with us," Jungkook cries, flustered when he remembers what Jimin and Taehyung had said earlier. They were wrong, Jungkook just knew."You don't just hug someone out of nowhere, Jungkook," Yoongi mumbles quietly, but the boy was listening enough to hear him."W-What? How did you know-""I saw the Dispatch crew following you when you left yesterday." Yoongi explains, "She took a picture of you two but I got the girl to delete it."This comes as a huge surprise to Jungkook, and he wasn't sure what shocked him more, the fact that his hyung, out of all people, had seen him and [Name], or the fact that Yoongi convinced the photographer to get it deleted and keep her lips sealed."How did you convince her, Hyung?"Yoongi has a mischievous smile on his face as he shakes his head and motions for Jungkook to follow him."I did something. But that's not important, now come on before I get angry."His curiosity was killing him, but Jungkook sighs, taking his chapstick lying on the dresser and then following his hyung outside. The noise of the chatter makes the two exchange a glance, and they are both surprised to see that Jimin is trying to teach her a dance step while the others are laughing.Possibly of what a hopeless case [Name] was.The instant he sees her, Jungkook couldn't help but smile widely. He didn't know how to admit it, but even a day felt like a long while. In the back of his head, what Taehyung had said would replay in his head, and he shakes his head, appalled that the thought even crosses his head.In the middle of a step, [Name] freezes, making Hoseok gasp loudly."What's wrong?""Cramps," She croaks, slipping down on her seat. The boys begin to smile, and Yoongi notices Jungkook's shoulders rising up and down while he tries to stifle his laughter."Well, why are we standing here? Come on," Yoongi pats his back, and the two walk out to the living room, coming into view."Ahh, Jungkook, Yoongi-hyung!""Hey there.""Hello."Jungkook's response is the smallest, and he gives an awkward wave to [Name]. The two exchange tiny smiles, before Hoseok butts in."Jungkookie, [Name] made us a present, but it's mostly for you," He has to say, pointing to the bag she had beside her leg. The girl looks a little embarrassed as she breaks eye contact with Jungkook, and takes her bag instead. All eyes are on her in silence, while she takes the box inside and opens the cover.Little gasps escape from the members, as they see a cake now sitting in the middle of the coffee table."[Name]..."The girl reaches for something else inside the bag, and Jungkook realises that it was a small flag, that had 'Congratulations on graduation, Jungkook!', handwritten on it."Cheesecake?" Jin wants to know. The girl nods in response, a sheepish smile on her face while he waves for the boy to come up to her already. Taehyung hurries to take his phone out, and this makes the rest of the members take out their smartphones as well, taking a picture while Jungkook goes to sit beside [Name] in utter shock."You didn't have to...""Yeah, but I wanted to get you a present. I wanted to get you this yesterday but I kinda messed up the base." She laughs, thanking Jin who brings a knife from the kitchen. "Yoongi-shi inviting me is like a chance to redeem myself."The boys laugh at little at her lame joke, while Taehyung lifts his phone and has it pointed at the cake."So, army, right now, Jungkookie is going to cut a cake a friend brought him so lets all clap for--""Wait, don't V-live this-" Jimin interrupts, pointing at [Name]. Taking the hint, the girl hurries to get up from beside Jungkook, moving and hiding behind Yoongi to avoid being in the shot.This was one of the things she loved the most about the boys, the fact that they involved their fans in their happy moments, and they were always themselves. She was slightly teary-eyed as Jungkook gives her an awkward smile again, cutting the cake and turning back to face her with another sheepish grin."Hyung, stop it," He says, raising a hand up to cover the camera.After a rather short V-live, the cake is cut into eight slices, and while everyone complained about how Jin's slice was the largest, Jungkook takes his plate, sitting beside [Name], who now sat beside Yoongi."I really like banana flavoured food." He gushes, making the girl smile back."I know, Kookie. You drink a lot of banana milk during lunch," She has to point out, watching the way Yoongi continues nodding as he ate. "And you're my bias wrecker so I do my fair share of research on you.""Should I be scared?" Jungkook responds with a chuckle. It made him a little ashamed with how he behaved earlier before she showed up. Why was he behaving so out of place? No wonder Taehyung and Jimin worried about him, he was really out of his mind. And as [Name] and Jungkook chatted, he calms down a little, relaxing into the conversation.The cake, as chef Jin had to point out, was a little under-sweetened, but the rest of the members seemed to enjoy the cake nonetheless.When everyone is done, Yoongi gets up."[Name], help me take the plates to the kitchen.""O-Oh. Okay," She blinks a little, hurrying to get up and collecting the plates. Yoongi points to the kitchen, and she takes the plates inside."So, does anyone have any objections? I'm going to recommend her to the director today."Everyone shakes their heads, even Jungkook, who hands his plate to Yoongi who had his hand held out."I'll join you in the recommendation," Hoseok offers in addition."We're gonna be in my dorm room, writing, if anyone needs us."At that, Jungkook glances back up to his hyung, in surprise.
Dorm room?
Jungkook could feel Jimin glancing at him, when Yoongi nods and takes the plates to the kitchen. He feels the familiar uneasy feeling clouding onto his head when the two of them walk out to the hallway together.
I haven't even thanked her properly for the cake yet...

While [Name] sat at the desk in front of Yoongi, she felt like she was going to explode.She was aware that by 'working together', he meant that the two would be uninterrupted by the others.But she didn't realise how nervous she was until Yoongi shuts the door behind him."I want to show you something," The rapper says, walking towards his bed. Blinking, [Name] glances at the way the boy lifts up the mattress, taking out a notebook with his free hand. He then puts the book on the desk, urging for the girl to open it.Hesitantly, the girl flips open the book, in awe when she sees the many, many lines of lyrics written on it. It wasn't a lie to say that the book was full, and she glances back up to Yoongi."Should I read this?""Yes, " He responds, taking a chair from the back and sitting in front of her. "I'm going to write a letter of recommendation now.""O-Oh. Thank you." She says in a tiny voice, and proceeds with reading. After a while, she finds herself calming down a little, the two of them exchanging small glances every once in a while."I like the fact that you're not madly obsessed with us," Yoongi speaks, as he wrote. "I've come across so many of them who I'm ashamed to call an army, even.""I am madly obsessed with bts," She corrects him, "But I try to control myself because you guys have the right of your own privacy.""Yeah, that's what I mean."A few moments of silence pass by, while Yoongi watches the way she scribbles and makes small amends on his book with a pencil. He liked how peaceful it was, after being around the gang for so long, it was a nice change to have some quiet time where he could actually hear himself think."I've been meaning to ask, why is your phone wallpaper a picture of Jungkook?"This makes the girl almost cough up a lung, her face reddening instantly. Yoongi watches her response in amusement, as she stuffs her phone deep into her pocket."He's my bias wrecker, that's why."Yoongi cringes a little at that, a face [Name] had seen so many times on screen when he would be so done with his bandmates. It makes her laugh a little, and she prayed that he wouldn't ask her who her bias was.She'd probably be too embarrassed to answer that one.But apparently, the 23-year-old has another question in mind, instead."You like him, don't you?""Yeah, I love everyone in Bangtan." She has to say, making Yoongi facepalm a little."You both are idiots. You're the same age as Jungkook, right?""I'm a year younger." She says, "But I can't understand how Kookie is so adorable.""Yeah, he's our cute maknae after all. I got one more question for you."[Name] puts her pencil down, glancing at the singer in front of her with newfound curiosity."Why didn't you ask me to hold your hand? At the fan sign? I was the one who had to get you to do it.""Oh yeah," She says, recalling the event, "Well, I've watched a lot of videos online, and well, you don't seem very comfortable with physical contact like that. I mean, at least, not as much as the others."This response makes Yoongi raise an eyebrow in surprise. The amount of attention she paid to him, and the fact that she respected his boundaries makes him smile a little.If only all of his fans were like that."That makes me want to hold your hand." He mumbles, making [Name] blink a little in shock. She feels a little out of place when he offers her a hand, but as much as she wanted to hold how greedy she was for anything related to her bias, she sighs heavily, slipping her hand in his like the last time.The two sit in silence, writing their respective works, while their fingers stay intertwined on top of the table. Yoongi could notice the way her lips were slightly trembling from the cold, and he hoped that at least her hand would feel a little warmer now.Yoongi is almost done with the letter when the door flies open. It wasn't a lie to say that he was actually waiting for Jungkook to crack.As soon as Jungkook steps in, the rapper retrieves his hand from [Name]'s, but it was a few seconds too late. The younger one fully saw it, and he has a sour expression on his face as he awkwardly walks to the drawer while excusing himself."I um, came to put my chapstick away before I misplaced it." Jungkook responds, putting the stick on his dresser. [Name] has a smile on her face as she watched Jungkook, he feels shy as he tries to go out as soon as possible.Until Yoongi calls his name."Jungkook, can you let [Name] borrow your chapstick? I think she wants some."This makes both of the recent high-school graduates widen their eyes, turning to look at Yoongi with shock visible on their faces."Ah, no, it's fine! I think I have my own somewhere..." She says, as she fumbles with the purse she had on her lap. By now, Jungkook is so red in the face that he feels his ears burning up as well. Shutting the door behind him, the young boy hurries back outside.There is more silence between the two, and Yoongi excuses himself for a minute, stepping outside and heading to the living room. Jungkook is now lying on the sofa, watching the ceiling, and his head immediately snaps up when he hears the sound of the door.Yoongi glances around the room, noticing that Hoseok and Jimin were the only ones who remained along with Jungkook. The others might have gone out to buy something, perhaps. The rapper reaches for the cabinet inside the kitchen, and when he pulls out a bottle of vodka, Jungkook, who overhears the clinking noise, appears to view."Hyung?""Hey. What is it?""Hyung... You're going to drink again?""A little." He responds. This makes another sour expression appear on Jungkook's face, and the younger boy leans against the counter a little, shaking his head."Please don't. You're with [Name] right now, and we also have to go for shooting after a couple hours..." The boy advices, hesitantly. To his surprise, Yoongi gives a nod, listening to him and putting the bottle back in place."You're righ- Oh," The rapper is interrupted by the noise of his smartphone ringing. When he picks up the phone, Jungkook sidles back outside again, sitting down on the sofa, this time feeling a little at ease.A few minutes later, Yoongi comes out of the kitchen, sitting beside Jungkook on the sofa."Great. Hoseok, the two of us need to go to a photo shoot.""What? But we have shooting in-""Pronto. Just us two, we postponed it the day before yesterday because we wanted to rest for Jungkook's graduation, remember?"Realisation dawns onto Hoseok's head, and the boy immediately nods. With a slight tap on Jungkook's shoulder, Yoongi gets up. The younger boy glances up at his hyung, who is motioning to follow him."We have to leave right now, so please see her off." Yoongi requests. "And complete the letter and hand it over to the director when he comes to check in, okay?"Jungkook looks a little alarmed as he follows his hyung and enters their shared dorm room again. [Name] has her earphones on again, and Yoongi seems slightly amused by the fact that she couldn't sit in silence for much long without music again.While Jungkook explains the situation to [Name], Yoongi puts his coat on, carelessly putting a beanie over his head before he gives a wave to the two. He then leaves the two alone again, and they exchange an awkward glance."Uh, Hyung asked me to take you downstairs. I'm sorry he had to leave like that.""No, it's fine, don't worry. I'm happy to have met everyone again... Although most of them didn't remember me." She laughs, and Jungkook joins in. After the boy steps outside, [Name] asks for a few seconds, stepping inside and putting Yoongi's notebook back under his mattress.And then, she left downstairs.The lift ride was silent between the two, and Jungkook could only think of one thing as he glances at [Name] a little.
 'Jungkookie falls in love, but he has no idea'. 
I'm not in love with her! The boy mentally cries, darting his gaze down to his feet. She's my fr-The loud noise of the metal door opening interrupts the boy - and startles [Name], as well - and Jungkook presses the finger scan machine. The gate opens, and she steps outside, turning around to give him a smile and a wave goodbye.
I'm not.
He manages a weak smile, waving back as the gate closes again. For once, he was glad that the door closes and he didn't have to see her anymore.He had no idea why seeing her started becoming something painful, in such a short while.He was scared of finding out the reason.

"We're always in need of more staff," Bang Sihyuk - the CEO of BigHit - has to say, five days later. "And I see that these three has recommended you to me."[Name] glances at Hoseok, Jungkook, and Yoongi, who is standing beside their beloved "pd-nim", with little smiles on their faces.Except for Hoseok, he was smiling so much that it looked like he was going to rip his face off.Poor [Name] had to look away from the energetic one before she melts at how adorable he is."Once you sign this, you can't change your mind for at least the next four years." Sihyuk adds in a warning tone. Yoongi chuckles in amusement at the way the girl nods her head slightly."You're quite young," He states. "You want to do the same thing Suga wanted to do.""Yeah, she's gonna do what I would have done if I wasn't in BTS." Yoongi volunteers. This makes [Name] smile, she knew she wouldn't regret the decision for the world, and it wasn't just because of the band she loved the most, but the fact that she could do what she always wanted to, ever since she began her high school life.The BTS part was just a huge bonus.Sihyuk continues his attempt to intimidate the girl."And you'll have to go wherever Yoongi goes." He lets her know. "Because he's a busy boy and you'll need to be there with him when he gets free time. So if we're going abroad, you're going to have to come with us. Literally, you're going to be like one of those stylists, minus the part where you actually do their makeup.""That's a harsh way to put it, but [Name], are you okay with it?""She looks hesitant..." Jungkook mumbles. This makes her shake her head. She was ready for whatever was to come, landing a job right after graduation was just her luck, after all."I can do this." She announces. Hoseok gives her a cheer when she picks up the pen, and she signs the sheet with a smile."Well then. Welcome to Big Hit, [Name]. You'll be moving two floors downstairs tomorrow.""Wait, what?" Jungkook seems shocked at this news, and Sihyuk raises an eyebrow."Yeah?""She's going to have to move, too?""Of course. Like I said, wherever Yoongi is, [Name] is going to be there.""Ohh! That sounds so cute." Hoseok giggles while he walks outside. His work was done, and he leaves, while Jungkook can just blink in shock from [Name] to Yoongi.[Name] and Yoongi, who are exchanging a glance which the younger boy tries to comprehend.The rapper shrugs, motioning for her to follow him outside."You'll have to follow me forever, what are you waiting for?" Yoongi has a playful smirk on his face as he spoke, which makes Jungkook twitch his eyes while he watched the two of them leaving."That just sounds very mean."   "We're going to Chile in like fifteen days," Jungkook explains, getting in the van. [Name] watches the way the boy closes the door after he does, and the vehicle rides off.The girl had requested that Jungkook helped her a little with the packing, if he had free time. Of course, it was just an excuse, which she later admits that she simply missed talking to Jungkook every day.This statement had made the young boy flustered, and he insisted that he'd help, anyways.After all, he missed her too.Surprisingly, [Name] had forgotten to bring her headphones today, and Jungkook offers his one to her. The girl smiles as she hands one earbud to him, holding her hand out to him.Jungkook looks at her hand, with an alarmed expression clouding on his face."W-What?""Can we listen to your songs today?"Jungkook's expression softens as he nods, digging into his pocket and taking his phone out. He feels a little embarrassed at what he had first thought out of the situation, and he avoids meeting eyes with her for a while after he types the passcode and hands it to her.Familiar pop music begins to play, and the boy glances back to his phone to see that she is playing a song he used to obsess over a lot."Boombayah?"The two begin to sing the song together, and towards the chorus, they are unable to keep still. In fact, they stop their mini dancing marathon only when Jungkook's hand accidentally hits the back of the driver's seat, making the man turn back in surprise.The maknae apologises profusely, trying his hardest to hold in the laughter until the driver turns his attention back to the road."Oh my god. That was terrible of us.""The second chorus is nearing, Jungkook. Wanna do a round two?"The young boy laughs as he shakes his head, watching the girl trying to turn her hand around and clumsily hitting his shoulder in the process."You're a terrible dancer, [Name]," He comments, leaning a little away to see her better. Instead of responding, she pulls at his earbud, and Jungkook watches the way it falls down onto the seat."What... Why?!""They said the forbidden word." She has to say, putting his earbud back in place."Forbidden word?""You know..." When Jungkook tilts his head in confusion, [Name] sighs loudly, and turns to look at him."Oppa," She whispers. It takes a few second for Jungkook to react, shaking his head a little as he giggled a bit."Well, you just said that anyway, [Name]. I don't see the point of you not making me listen to it, in the first place.""You just had to ask."With small chatter in between, the two sat, humming songs on the way. Climbing out of the vehicle, Jungkook thanks the driver after they reached [Name]'s apartment."Do you live on a very high floor?" Jungkook wants to know, adjusting his face mask and stepping into the lift. The girl shakes her head, pressing a button."I'm glad you didn't get caught."Open entering the apartment, Jungkook sees that the apartment actually consists of a single room. [Name] tells him about how her parents were not from Seoul, and how she originally intended to go back to her home city and find a job, when she graduated.The boy is a little in awe as he sat down on the beanbag. "Make yourself at home, don't hold back." [Name] says, pressing a switch on the corner. "Want me to play some music which you're probably tired of hearing?""How about, the first song on your playlist?"[Name] raises an eyebrow, scrolling up before she bursts out laughing. Jungkook wonders what was so funny, and when she presses play and the music begins to play from the bluetooth speakers on the coffee table, he could understand why.The first song on her playlist is the cover of Rainism that Jungkook had sung last year, and he feels a little embarrassed when the girl puts her phone beside the speaker and tries to copy him."I gotta be a bad boy.""[Name], there's no stopping you." Jungkook laughs, shaking his head at how terribly she was failing at imitating his steps."You really need to quit bias wrecking me, I swear to God." She says, turning it off.And while the two got to business with barely any talking between them, Jungkook had never, ever felt so relaxed.

Jungkook had some green tea before he left [Name]'s apartment. The two were excited for the next day, and the thought of seeing each other frequently is the reason why they both had smiles on their faces as Jungkook boarded the van and left.When the boy reaches his dorm room, he isn't surprised to see Yoongi up, tapping on his tablet."Hey.""Hi, Hyung. What are you doing?" Jungkook wants to know, taking off his coat and socks."I'm writing a bit for a track." He responds, his head bobbing up and down a little as he taps the screen and makes a tune."Can I see it?" The younger boy seems interested, sitting on his bed while he waits for a reply. Yoongi simply shakes his head, a smile forming on his face as he puts away his tablet."Nope. This one is a secret. I haven't shown this one to [Name] either, and I don't intend to let either of you hear it before it is released."Yoongi was still smiling, and that was what made Jungkook feel uneasy - and even suspicious, to some extent - when the older one puts his blankets over himself."Good night, Jungkook.""Sleep well, Hyung...." 
  Jungkook woke up to an entire cup of water getting poured all over his face, the next morning.He had always been a heavy sleeper, and usually, his hyungs would let him be for a while, letting him slowly get himself up after multiple 'five more minutes'.But when the water - cold water, at that - pours all over his face, Jungkook gasps, shooting up straight and getting greeted with Taehyung, who has a playful expression on his face. Jungkook is about to get up to kick the boy with all his might, until he speaks up."Come on, you missed breakfast, you even missed [Name] moving in downstairs.""Eh?"Taehyung looks at the empty cup in his hand, before he tosses it at Jungkook's face. The latter is still a little surprised, and he wipes his face with his shirt before he gets himself up."Your breakfast is probably cold now. We had waffles!" Taehyung has a big smile on his face as he sits on the bed, his glance on Jungkook who goes to the bathroom to get a brush."Waffles?""Yeah. Hyung took [Name] for breakfast, and they brought us food on their way," Taehyung informs, his smile widening. "The blueberry ice cream on top of mine was amazing!""Hyung?" Jungkook questions from between his toothpaste, and the other boy nods. "Which hyung?""Obviously, Suga-hyung. I think he got you strawberry ice cream, though.""Suga-hyung took [Name] for breakfast?" Jungkook fully ignores the comments about the ice cream, and Taehyung looks a little disappointed at this fact. He frowns slightly, giving a nod. Jungkook was aware of his own eyes clouding a little, and the other boy notices this instantly."Suga-hyung is trying really hard to make [Name] happy." Taehyung mutters, when Jungkook returns after rinsing his mouth. "But why does that make you feel weird?""It doesn't make me feel weird." Jungkook denies instantly, reaching for a clean shirt to put on."Yup. It shouldn't, since you're not in love with [Name] or anything. Right?"Jungkook pauses a little, frozen at Taehyung's mention yet again. He feels his eyebrows knotting together, while he shoots a glare at the brown-haired male."Now go out, I need to get dressed." The boy speaks in a firm voice. Taehyung shrugs a little, getting off the bed and exiting the room.Jungkook takes his sweet time combing his hair and getting ready before he leaves outside. 

 
 "Jungkookie and Jiminie are here!""Really?""They never get in here, like ever!"The whispers make [Name] look up from her suitcase that rested on her bed.Sihyuk had given [Name] her own room, with the intention of giving her personal space to think. She was to share the dorm with all of BTS's stylists, and they had all welcomed her warmly enough for her to feel relaxed with being the only one who didn't have to share a room.With the mention of the names, [Name] steps outside, and as told, she sees Jungkook making his way towards her, while Jimin stands to chat with one of the ladies."Hi, [Name].""Kookie, good morning." She greets with a wave, closing the door behind her. Jungkook glances at the door for a few seconds before he turns back to face her."Are you fine with here?""Of course I am. Thank you for asking." She bows a little, instantly flustering Jungkook at the unrequired action. "I got a room of my own even though I told Pd-nim that I'm alright with sharing, too."Jungkook smiles at this information, glancing back at where Jimin stood. At this, the older boy excuses himself, approaching the two."Hello, is everything alright, [Name]?"She feels her heart race a little at how sincere Jimin sounds, and she takes a few seconds manage a response. "Y-Yes. Thank you."A few seconds of silence pass by, and Jungkook habitually rocks his head to the side and back, wondering what to say."Um... So, we'll be going to the studio now. I came to check on you because I couldn't wake up earlier..." Jungkook's voice trails a little when [Name] shakes her head and smiles."It's okay, Jungkookie. Thank you for stopping by. Good luck with recording!" She responds, raising a fist to show her encouragement. "Fighting!""Fighting!" The two bandmates respond with little goofy grins on their faces, and they excuse themselves, stepping outside and leaving. As soon as the doors close, some of the stylists squeal a little, making [Name] laugh.Of course, no matter how much time she spent with the boys, she was sure she would still be an obsessed fangirl, deep down.Meanwhile, there is silence between Jimin and Jungkook, as they get on the lift. When Jimin eyes the younger boy, Jungkook raises a hand to the nape of his neck."What's wrong, hyung?""Nothing," Jimin responds, a distant look on his face. "[Name] seems very nice.""Yeah." Jungkook agrees, a lopsided smile forming on his face. "She really is."Jimin nods a little, glancing to the doors the slide open."I think Suga-hyung is writing a song about her, for one of his tracks."Jungkook feels his stomach groan at this new information, and he raises an eyebrow in surprise."Why do you think that, hyung?""Because I saw him tapping on his tablet when we were here earlier, when he brought the food and [Name] was taking it out for us." Jimin lets him know, the two of them stepping inside. There is chaos inside, some of the stylists working on Namjoon and Jin's hair and the noise making the two raise their hands to their ears.As fast as they entered, they get back inside the lift and press the ground floor."And I thought that was rude of Suga-hyung to do that while [Name] was right beside him." Jimin continues. "Since he's the ones who is the closest to her from between us. So I was going to tell him to put it away, but I saw that he was writing lyrics which he hid from me as soon as I leant in to tell him that."Jungkook wanted to tell him that he was probably thinking way too much. That it was just a coincidence, and that he didn't feel like Yoongi would do that.But from the way things were going on recently, Jungkook wasn't so sure anymore.And he wasn't sure if he liked that, either.

The music video of 'Not Today' was a huge hit, and right after the release, the boys began preparing for their concert in Seoul.This meant that they were always busy, waking up at the crack of dawn and at their studio for practice and at dress rehearsals up till dusk.[Name] spent almost all of her time indoors, her usual routine of watching Bangtan's content, and writing in between, when she got some inspiration to do so. She could barely speak to Jungkook, Yoongi, or anyone for that matter. Even the stylists which she shared the dorm with, were busy all day, out with the boys at all times.On the day of the concert, the manager cracks."We need more hands." Bang Sihyuk calls her that morning, and from what she heard, he sounded really stressed out. "We're sending a van in ten minutes, will you help us out backstage?"This makes [Name] blink in shock, almost dropping the phone she had in her clutches."[Name], yes or no?""Yes! Of course!" She responds instantly, and he hangs up the phone, with clear instructions to be downstairs right away.The girl was excited about the thought of attending a concert - even if it was just backstage to help out. Within the few days, she had seen how much the boys tried, and it was much, much more than what she had first given credit for, when she had just known their tales from online.Bangtan Sonyeondan tried ten times harder than they should, simply to make their fans happy.And as a fan, she was so touched when she reaches the concert venue.One of the stylists greets her at the door, pulling her inside the hallway. The entire place was hectic, and she saw a glimpse of Jimin moving inside a room and a lady hands him three layers of clothing to put on. [Name]'s glance then lands on Taehyung, who is practising a little while his stylist blow-dries his hair.Feeling out of place, she calms down a little when she finally sees pd-nim waving towards her. He hands her a clipboard with five sheets, all of which had events which she was in charge of. It comes as a huge surprise for her when she sees all the events that occur backstage as well. In addition, the weather was so warm, and she hurries to bring out bottled water for the boys.Taking the last few bottles and balancing the clipboard in hand, she steps into the last room, which was Jungkook, Namjoon, and Jin's. The older two greet her with grateful smiles when she hands out the water to them, and when she glances at Jungkook, she giggles to see that he was dozing off."I can't even put makeup on him!' The stylist laughs, as she takes a few seconds off to take a sip of water. "He's dozing off, but I don't want to wake him up until the last minute.""That's so nice of you. Kookie must be tired," [Name] responds, taking out a chair and sitting in front of Jungkook. The stylist looks startled at what she was doing, but when [Name] puts her hands together under his chin and lifts his head up a little, she understands what was going on."Ah, thank you."And that way, [Name] lifts Jungkook's head up as softly as she could, while the stylist hurries to finish up."His face is so warm, do you think he isn't feeling well?""I'm not sure. He was fanning himself up till he dropped it and fell asleep." She answers, handing [Name] the fan. Nodding, the girl shifts herself a little, using one hand to hold his chin up and the other to fan the boy. Taking the cue, the stylist wipes the sweat off from his face, and continue her work."That's adorable." Jin's voice calls, and [Name]'s attention flies to him and Namjoon, who sat chuckling at them. In fact, Jin had already taken a picture of the boy who was dozing off, and [Name] feels slightly embarrassed. Trying not to let the heat rushing to her face distract her from what she was supposed to do, she continues to fan the young boy with all her might.Around ten minutes pass by before the stylist is done. Jungkook, as usual, looked absolutely charming, and the stylist asks [Name] to wake him up and get him some water to drink before she puts some chapstick on his lips.Nodding, the girl puts the fan down, tapping his cheek slightly to wake him up. Jungkook does not budge, and she taps a little harder, receiving no response from him.Taking the fan, she pokes his stomach with the end of it, and this makes Jungkook's eyes crack an eye open, a little."Kookie, wake up. You've been sleeping for a while now." She says, hands still under his cheek. Now that Jungkook had opened his eyes, she begins to fan him again, and it takes a few seconds for the boy to understand the situation."W-What?!" He cries,  stepping away with wide eyes. With her free hand, she picks up the bottle of water, and hands it to him."Hurry, drink some water, you're up to perform in-""Jungkook, two minutes, forty seconds!" Another woman yells, stepping inside.Jungkook still looks alarmed as he opens the cap of the bottle, taking a sip. He glances at [Name] who continues to fan him, and after he is done, he puts the bottle away and takes the fan in her hand."Thank you, [Name]. I'll do the fanning myself, please take some rest. Noona, please quickly put some chapstick on now so you can finish too."Both [Name] and the stylist feel their hearts melt at the half-smile the boy offers them. Nodding, the two stand up, and [Name] gives him a thumbs up before she takes her clipboard and goes out. Music had begun to boom from outside, and the chaos backstage becomes even louder and more difficult to manoeuvre through."[Name], call Jimin, he's up in thirty seconds!" A voice calls from the door, and the girl nods, hurrying to where she had last seen Jimin at. The boy is dressed and ready, and she calls for the boy to hurry and come outside."Good luck, Jimin-oppa!" She cheers, and the older boy reacts with a nod, along with a grin she barely saw because he breaks into a run."Jungkook, fifty seconds to go!""Kookie, please get out here!" [Name] runs to where she had moments ago stepped out, and Jungkook glances at his shoes in frustration. The shoelaces were untied, and before he can say anything, the girl gets down on both her knees, placing tight knots on his shoes."[Name], you don't have to do this!""These are sincere feelings of an army, Jeon Jungkook. Don't toss this away." [Name] has to say, securely tying the other shoe as well and standing up."Jungkook, twenty seconds, go go go!""Thank you, [Name]. I'm going to try hard for all the armys." The boy gives a thumbs up, the two of them exchanging a smile before he runs out to go up the stairs and on the stage.Concerts were hectic enough where the attendees are at. The boys would put on flawless performances, but behind all that were stressed out staff, a lot of sweat and effort put into making sure everything goes perfectly. While seeing the turmoil going on first hand, [Name] gets a profound moment then, as she watched the boys on the screen.She still had a lot of work to do.But she didn't feel burdened by it at all, and it wasn't just because they were Bangtan Sonyeondan.It was because they loved her, and all their fans endlessly.And she couldn't stop falling in love with the boys over and over again.Even when Yoongi and Jungkook run back inside to prepare for their next performance, in between; even when they were trying to hide their faces because they claimed to look "sweaty and disgusting", she simply laughs and hurries to take cool pieces of clothes for them to wipe their faces.She couldn't really do anything big like help them fix their hair, but she feels content helping out with minor things like that.Which was why, at the end of the concert, when the boys had already left to get some food to eat and rest, she politely rejects the envelope of pay that the director hands her."It's fine, I'm simply happy just helping out." She has to say, wiping her own sweat with the sleeve of her shirt. Sihyuk seems a little taken aback, asking her to get in the van with him and the rest of the staff that helped out today. "Since you didn't accept the pay, I'll give you dinner."[Name] felt like she would explode with how nice the entire staff of Big Hit was. Never had she expected them to be so caring towards their employees, and when they pull over in front of a restaurant, her eyes go wide to see that the band members are eating there as well, now dressed in casual clothes and with beanies and other props to blend in with the others as much as possible.When Yoongi notices that [Name] is one of the staff that enters and sits on the table beside theirs, he begins to wave at her. Taehyung joins in and calls her name, urging her to join in with them, and this makes the girl flustered and shake her head shyly, embarrassed."Go. They're asking you to, now go." One of the stylists has to say, giving her a little push. When she glances at where Jungkook is, strands of noodles scooped up by his chopstick while he nods at her, she couldn't say no."To a successful concert!" The boys raise their glasses - all of them alcohol except for Jungkook and [Name]'s, of course - and the endless chatter between them begins instantly.But [Name] had no words, as she sat quietly beside Yoongi.She ate her food in silence, because her heart was too filled with so much love for the boys, she couldn't even speak.
I'm fangirling over the best group.

"Thirty hours, [Name]. We're gonna be on the plane for that long." Taehyung informs, clutching his sidebag a little.Even though he had already mentioned this at least five times, she responds with awe as she followed him.The boys were heading to Chile for the first part of their tour outside of Korea, and Jungkook was the excited one, standing at the front of the line and boarding the plane first. When he sits down and calms himself down a little, he sees that [Name]'s seat is beside Taehyung's, along with space between himself and her. He feels a little frustrated when he notices this, and the fact that Jimin's seat was beside his own makes it even worse."You seem very disappointed to sit with me." Jimin jokes, and the boy waves it off.Thirty hours in a flight was no joke. In fact, the boys had been on a flight for longer, before, but it was still just as tiring as their previous adventures. They were quite tired after their long days, and they took the opportunity to catch up on their sleep. Fifteen hours into the flight, [Name] was the only one up, and she takes out her notebook, scribbling notes she takes about the country.She was aware that the boys would probably be too busy to enjoy any of the 'must-see' sights on the internet. It was a pity, but just in case... Just in case, she made some notes to be safe."What are you doing?" Yoongi's voice interrupts, and she is a little startled as she slams the book shut. This makes the rapper raise an eyebrow, sitting on the armrest of her chair."Yoongi-oppa, I thought you were sleeping.""I just got up. They're giving food in ten minutes, so I went to brush my teeth." He responds, leaning a bit closer. [Name] inhales at the action, but calms down when she realises that Yoongi was reaching to tap Taehyung's shoulder."Hey, get up. We're getting food." Yoongi calls, waking the younger boy up. He then turns to face [Name]. "Now give me that notebook and you go brush too.""You are such a mom..." [Name] mumbles, handing the book to him and getting up. On her way, she notices Jungkook snoring softly, his lips parted slightly. He looked so adorable that she covers her mouth to hide the ugly expression she was sure she would be making."Stop looking at Jungkook and go."Yoongi's voice makes her ears burn up, and she flushes red before she hurries to stomp towards the restroom.The food was delicious, and it didn't really surprise [Name] when most of the boys went back to sleep right after they were done with eating. Surprisingly, Jungkook stays awake, and the noise machine beside her, Taehyung, was charged enough to begin taking videos of the members.Jungkook wasn't sure how long it took, but [Name] finally falls asleep, her face buried against the neck rest that she had on. This makes the boy chuckle, because the other half of her face was covered by her hair.He couldn't stop himself from taking a picture of her before he puts back his headphones on.   Filtering themselves through the heavy crowd of fans and paparazzi's took almost forever, and the boys are dead beat by the time they arrive at their hotel rooms.Upon reaching, the director lets the boys know that they are free to go sight seeing, so long as they are back in the hotel in five hours, sharp.The excitement in the air was contagious. Taehyung surprisingly pairs up with Hoseok, the two of them taking the city map offered to them and running off. This makes Jimin and Jin run outside and follow the two right afterwards."I'll need my wallet first." Namjoon is the only person who takes a legitimate approach, reaching for his bag and fishing it out. He disappears off, leaving Jungkook and Yoongi the only ones behind. Most of the stylists had left as well, and [Name] is about to leave awkwardly before she hears Yoongi call her name."[Name], you follow me, remember?"This makes both Jungkook and [Name]'s jaw drop open, until the older boy shakes his head laughing."I'm joking. I'm going to sleep." Yoongi has to say, forming a gun out of his fingers and shooting it to his head. "See you later, losers."The two blink in surprise as the rapper steps inside his room and closes the door shut. Jungkook glances at [Name] a little, a bit nervous about what to say."So... I think maybe I should-""[Name], I saw you writing something on the flight, was it another song?""Ah, no," She explains, shaking her head. "I noted some places you guys could go if you... Oh."[Name] pauses when she realises that what she had wanted had come true. Jungkook has a little confused look on his face, asking if he could see the list.The very first on the list is a beach which - when they checked the map in the lounge room - was just a fifteen-minute ride away."Do you want to go with me?" Jungkook asks, as he stuffs the map into his jeans pocket. [Name] gives a quick nod in response, the two of them taking face masks before they step out of the hotel."When I went to America for boot camp, I wanted to get in the water and play," Jungkook recalls, laughing to himself at the memory. [Name] simply gives a nod in response, she wasn't going to let him know that she had watched enough content of the boys to have come across that bit as well.The two walk in silence, taking in the sights in awe, sometimes even taking pictures - [Name] using her phone while Jungkook uses the handy camera he had draped around his neck."[Name], look! There's ice cream. Do you want some?""Sure!" The two pause, walking into the store. Picking out their favourite flavours, Jungkook reaches for his wallet to pay, only to realise that he had completely forgotten to use the currency exchange machine back at the airport."Oh man..." The boy looks flustered, his face turning a little red. [Name] notices this, smiling a little as she reaches for a couple dollars she had in handy, in her pocket."It's fine, don't apologise so much, Kookie!" She says for the almost-hundredth time, as they slowly approached the beach. Jungkook does not seem convinced, and the girl is left with no choice but to make a compromise."Okay, so in return, the next time you're free like this, will you hang out with me a bit?"Jungkook blinks a little, swallowing the ice cream inside his mouth before he nods."Oh, okay..."The boy still seems a little unconvinced, before [Name] lets out a small squeal."Jungkook!"The boy's attention flies towards where she is pointing with her free hand, and he catches sight of the white sand of the beach."Wow.""Amazing."The two jog a little to the sand, taking off their shoes as they near the water. Jungkook has already finished his ice cream, and [Name] offers to throw it away to the trash can while the boy takes pictures with his camera. When she returns, the boy is sitting on the sand and she feels lucky that she hadn't worn anything flashy that could be ruined easily. Sitting beside the boy, the two sat, watching the waves crash close by their feet."I just want to get in the water." Jungkook laughs, watching the way [Name] moves a little backwards, in case the water hits her feet."Why don't you get in, then?""Nah..." The boy shakes his head, taking his camera off from around his neck. He hands it to the girl, which makes her a little surprised. Before she can say anything, he lies back, closing his eyes and lowering his face mask a little. [Name] sees that Jungkook is smiling, and this makes her heart race a little.The sound of a snap makes Jungkook open his eyes, and he has an alarmed expression on his face when he realises that she had taken a picture of him, with his camera."You looked really good in that, Jungkook." She comments, showing the screen to him. The boy pouts a little in response, putting his mask back on."I'm glad I didn't go with the others... I mean, I'm sure they're having a lot of fun, but it's been too long since I got to talk to you like this." Jungkook mutters, thankful for the mask which hides how red he got right after he hears his own words.[Name] doesn't respond, instead offering him a thankful smile while she held the camera tightly. Jungkook sits up, and the two sit, watching the waves crashing.It was in silence, but this was the most fun the two had in days.

Yoongi's birthday fell two days before their first concert.The boys made sure to celebrate his birthday to the fullest, the usual cakes, food, party hats and other 'aegyo' materials that Jimin and Taehyung had brought along from Korea.[Name], who enjoyed making food - even though she wasn't really good at it - was in the hotel kitchen, where she had requested a corner with an oven. She wanted to make something for Yoongi by herself, not just buy something. She figured that he'd get whatever he wanted, and it felt more meaningful for her to make something on her own.While she takes out the cake she had baked for the rapper, she feels her phone buzz in her pocket. Cleaning her hands, she picks up the call which is surprisingly from Yoongi himself."Where are you?" He asks as soon as she picks up the phone, and [Name], for once, could not think of telling a lie."I'm in the kitchen..." She lets him know. It was slightly funny for her when he let's a little 'hmm' in response before he hangs up. She was sure that he would have been nodding to himself, and she puts her phone down, hurrying to place the cake on a plate to finish it by the time he arrives.But Yoongi shows up within a few minutes, and [Name] blinks in surprise, a sour smile on her face as Yoongi squints his eyes at her."What even.""Shhh, I'm almost done, Oppa." She has to say, taking out the frosting she had prepared beforehand. Yoongi has a small smirk on his face while he crosses his hands and watched [Name] at work, cleaning every inch and finishing the touch-ups."That's the smallest cake I have ever received." He has to say, when she hands the knife to him. To her, Yoongi had initially appeared to be a serious person, and she couldn't express how thrilled she was to learn that hidden under all the layers of swag, there was a little boy inside who just loved to play around."You don't want to get fat, do you?" She responds. This makes his mouth hang a little open at the good comeback, and Yoongi shrugs, sinking the knife into the cake."How did you get this place for yourself?" He questions, cutting a slice for himself. When [Name] takes the slice and places it on a paper plate, Yoongi takes a bite out of it, nodding as he chewed the dessert."Very sweet. I like it." He comments, taking another bite. "Thanks, [Name]. I was wondering why you weren't around for dinner."The girl gives a proud smile in response, her teeth showing when the boy asks if he can take the rest of the cake up to his room. When she nods, he tilts his head a little before he takes a bite off from his fork, and offers it to the girl."You get one bite."[Name] was getting used to the way Yoongi behaved, so she hurries to take the bite, remembering to thank the staff before she follows him out of the kitchen. Being the gentleman that he is, Yoongi waits for [Name] to enter her shared hotel room, before he enters his own.Jungkook and Hoseok are watching something from a tablet, and the younger boy greets his hyung, his eyes darting to the bag in his hand."Hyung, what's that?""Wait."Yoongi puts the bag on the coffee table, taking two of the plastic forks he had brought along with the bag and handing it to the younger ones. The two look a little surprised when Yoongi takes the cake out, but it turns to excitement while the two dig in to take bites."Aah. Too sweet!" Hoseok has to say, taking one more bite before he tosses the fork into the recycling bin. Jungkook does not look bothered, continuing to eat bite after bite until Yoongi gasps and snatches the bag away."Don't just eat everything. [Name] made this, you know."Jungkook almost chokes out the cake inside his mouth at this information, while Hoseok does not move an inch."She's good at baking..." Jungkook manages to say, tossing the fork away and licking the frosting on his lips."[Name]'s really nice to you, hyung." Hoseok has to add, putting his headphones back on. The youngest one takes a glance to Yoongi, who is nodding while he puts the bag beside his bed."Yeah. I like the way she treats me. The attention she gives me is meaningful. I'm thankful to have met her, thanks to you, Jungkook." The rapper says, as he sits on his bed. "Ah, this was a good birthday."Jungkook smiles back at his hyung, happy to see that he had enjoyed his special day. He has a little unsettling feeling in his stomach, which he tosses away with the excuse of the non-traditional dinner he had at dinner earlier.At least, he tried to."Hyung, I want to get [Name] a present." Jungkook announces suddenly, and Yoongi lifts his blanket over from his face. Hoseok continues to bob his head as he listens to the music playing from the tablet, and Jungkook turns to face the elder boy."You want to get her a present. Why?" Yoongi seems amused, and the boy shrugs in response."Well, she's always the one who gives me presents and stuff. I want to get her something meaningful too.""Your real reason is so obvious to everyone but you." Yoongi mumbles softly, and Jungkook, who doesn't quite catch what he said, raises an eyebrow."What?""Nothing. Why not get her a souvenir?" He suggests. "Or maybe go for dinner with her later after the shows."That sounded like a good plan, and Jungkook nods a little. Before he can respond, there is a knock on the door, and Hoseok offers to go open the door. With curiosity, Jungkook watches his hyung open the door, revealing [Name], who stands outside with a small bag in hand."Hobi-oppa, here's the shampoo you asked for." She says, handing the bag out to him. Hoseok recalls when he has asked [Name] what kind of shampoo she used, since it smelled nice. He feels flattered when he sees a bottle inside, and he bows a little to thank her for it, even though she didn't have to do so."[Name] is so precious." Hoseok comments, after he closes the door and gets back on his bed. Jungkook blinks a little, in thought, wondering what he should do.He still had someone who he wanted to talk to, and hopefully, after he did, he would stop feeling so sour whenever Yoongi brought up anything related to [Name].He really hoped what Taehyung and Jimin said was wrong.

Namjoon is drying his hair when there is a rough knock on the door.The last person he was expecting was Jungkook, who stood, hands behind his back as he looks at the elder boy expectantly."Hyung, can I talk to you about something?"For Jungkook, Namjoon was a role model. He had initially joined BigHit simply for the fact that the older rapper picked the company as well. Starting out from a small company, having multiple hurdles and difficulties, and everything in between had made all of them close to each other.He approached Namjoon whenever he had troubles.And most of the time, the older one would be aware of what had been bothering Jungkook for so long... He'd simply wait for him to open up himself."You're not comfortable with [Name] working for Suga?" Namjoon wants to know, when Jungkook explains how bothered he was feeling as of late."It's not that I'm not comfortable... I just don't trust it..."Namjoon runs a hand through his hair, putting the dryer back in place. He takes a seat beside the maknae, wondering what he could do be softer on the approach of telling him what was actually going on that he was so oblivious to.And from what Taehyung and Jimin had informed him earlier, Jungkook does not take the fact of being in love with [Name] even as a possibility."You don't trust Suga?""No! I trust Hyung more than anything!" Jungkook says, raising both his hands up. "Suga-hyung can decide what's right and what's wrong for himself, I know he will.""So... You don't trust [Name]?"At this, Jungkook pauses, taking a minute to think about this for the very first time. He had talked about a lot of his personal things with her, and he wonders if it was because he was close with her."I trust [Name]." He decides. "I trust her, I know she's smart enough to know to decline something she doesn't want.""But you don't trust 'it' when they both are together? I don't know what it is that you don't trust." Namjoon attempts, looking at the maknae. Jungkook has a doleful expression on his face as he recalls the memory of when [Name] had gone into his shared dorm room and worked with Yoongi.He didn't like that one bit, and what bothered him the most was how Yoongi even wanted to have alcohol as he was with her."Hyung doesn't even like drinking that much, but he keeps drinking when he's with [Name]. I don't trust alcohol, I want [Name] to be careful...""You mentioned that she likes Yoongi the most, out of us, right? If she's in love with him, what's the problem? From what I see, he really cares about her."This makes Jungkook's eyes go wide, he felt shocked that Namjoon would even suggest something like that."Hyung, why would you say that? It's not okay, we aren't sure what's on their minds!""Want me to be very honest with you?""Yes?""Taehyung's right. You could not be any more in love with [Name]." Namjoon finally says, patting Jungkook's shoulder lightly. "Let's hope [Name] thinks of you the same way.""Hyung... Not you too..."Jungkook's nails dig into Namjoon's hand as he swats the arm away before he stands up. Ignoring his hyung's calls, he excuses himself, exiting the room with fast strides.Jungkook wasn't the type to usually get very angry, he was more of the type to get sad than that. By the time he walked downstairs and steps out of the back door of the hotel, he calms down a little, especially after he sees Taehyung leaning against the wall."Hyung?""Hey, Jungkookie! I'm going to go with Jiminie and [Name] to the park to play with water balloons! Do you want to come with us?"The mention of her name makes his face fall instantly, and he shakes his head."No, I'll come some other time.""Why do you look so frustrated?" Taehyung seems a little worried now, and Jungkook shakes his head again, a little faster and in a hurry as he takes a few steps back."I'm not in love with [Name], but Rapmon-hyung thinks I am, just like you and Jimin-hyung do." Jungkook confesses.Taehyung seems a little surprised that the older one would say that, but he wasn't going to let this chance of making Jungkook admit already go away."That's because you are in love with her, you just don't want to admit it.""No.""Why? Is she not pretty enough for you? Not talented enough for someone like you? She doesn't have the perfect looks that you want in a girl?" Taehyung's eyebrows are knotted together as he speaks, and this makes Jungkook clench his teeth, his anger rising back up. But Taehyung was not done."What is it? Why are you trying so hard to stay away from loving her even though you're so against her being with Suga-hyung? You know there's nothing going on between them but it bothers you!""Goddamit, hyung. I'm not in love with [Name], and I'll probably never be!" Jungkook yells loudly, frustrated and mad at how pestering Taehyung behaved.The older one simply looks with wide eyes, his mouth hung a little open. This wasn't the reaction Jungkook expected, but he does not stop, even when Taehyung raises a hand to motion for him to stop."I'm tired of this, hyung. Stop saying impossible things. [Name] can simply go and be with Suga-hyung... I don't care."It hurt his heart even as he said this, and he was shocked as to why he got so defensive. Taehyung has a defeated look on his face, as he mumbles something so softly that the boy couldn't even hear him."What?""[Name], wait..."Jungkook has a horrified expression on his face as his eyes go wide, too afraid to turn around, but he had to make sure...And all he saw was the figure of [Name] turning back as soon as he does so, her hair swaying from side to side as she ran back inside the hotel room, fists clenched tightly.For a minute, Jungkook forgot to breathe.

Bangtan Sonyeondan didn't consider Jungkook as their 'Golden Maknae' for nothing.He was good at everything.And running was no exception, he caught up to [Name] by the time she reaches the end of the staircase."[Name]!" He cries, catching his breath while his hands gripped tightly to her left wrist. She wasn't crying, but she definitely didn't look good like she had been earlier this morning, lips pressed into a thin line. Jungkook wasn't good at understanding and expressing feelings, but even he could tell that she was close to crying.He had screwed up, and he hurt someone's feelings, which he shouldn't have done."[Name], I didn't mean it, please hear me out-""Jungkook, I'm begging you. Please let go of my hand." She says in a low voice, her eyes on her shoes as she tries to hide her face which she knew would be on a whole new level of ugly right about now."But you mean a lot to me, I don't know why I said that, please hear me out first..." Jungkook whispers, his grip on her wrist tightening. [Name] tries hard to not look up at his face even though her wrist was starting to hurt as much as her heart right about then."I'm sorry."Jungkook blinks in surprise, why was she apologising when he was the one that had to do that in the first place? Even though he probably didn't deserve to be forgiven, even if he did so?"Jeon Jungkook," She repeats, her voice firmer this time as she tries to hold herself from crying out loud. "Let go of my hand right now, or I'll report you."Jungkook's eyes are wide as he lets go of her hand in fear... Not just for the words she said, but with the way she spat out his name like it was poison in her mouth, like it was something so foul that she wanted to get rid of.He didn't want her to get rid of him, so why did he say something that would sound to her like he wanted to do that with her?He couldn't move, filled with so many regrets as he watched the girl climb up the stairs, missing a step and almost tumbling down in the process. And even then he couldn't move, he was too busy hating himself for saying things that were obvious lies, he knew it, but why did he do that?Jungkook couldn't see the way [Name] stops at the first floor, she didn't have the energy to go any further, and she walks loose on the floor. She wasn't aware where she was going, but when she opens the door nearest to her, she sees that it is a restroom, and she runs as fast as she could towards one of the stalls, locking herself inside and leaning against the wall while she finally allows the tears to fall down.There is a flushing noise from beside her stall, and she tries her best to not make any noise, failing miserably. The person who steps outside is Yoongi, who adjusts his hat a little as he glances at the mirror.The sobbing noise makes him raise an eyebrow, glancing at the door of the stall as he walks a little closer to it."Oi. Is everything alright in there?" Yoongi kicks the door of the stall lightly. This makes [Name] gulp, she didn't want to speak, but at the same time, her bias was constantly making her want to cry even more by kicking the door."Please leave me alone, Oppa." She manages to say in a low voice, and there is a low gasp from the other side of the stall while Yoongi blinks as he understands who spoke to him."[Name]? Is that you? This is the male's restroom, what the f-""Please go away, please." She begs, her last word escaping as a small sob while she tried to control herself. She wasn't sure how she managed to control her tears in front of Jungkook, but she was glad. So glad that she managed to go away from him before he saw her now-red face which she never wanted anyone to see."I don't know what the fuck goes around in your mind, but if you think I don't give any shits about you, then you're wrong. Get out of this stall." Yoongi orders, his voice firm. [Name] sniffles a little, she looked terrible, and she wasn't ready to face anyone, why couldn't he understand?It wasn't just Jungkook's words that hurt her, but the reason why they hurt her, in the first place.It wasn't simply for the fact that she treasured Jungkook as a friend, but she really, deeply had feelings for the boy which she simply didn't know what to give a name for.Of all the times she could understand what she was feeling, why was it now, when she felt so sour inside?There is a loud bang on the stall door, which startles the girl who could barely haul herself up. [Name] is slightly frightened when the door gets yet another kick, making it fly open and the lock goes flying and hits the back of the wall. [Name] has her hands raised up to her face in defence, and Yoongi steps inside, taking hold of her wrist and pulling her outside."Oppa...""I won't look at your face. Just come out of there." The older boy says softly, which makes her loosen her tight hold, while Yoongi pulls her out of the restroom."Wait." Yoongi requests, taking off his hat and putting it over her head. For a second, she is confused at what he wanted to do with that, but when she realises why he did what he did, she felt even more tears streaming down her face.
He wanted to hide her face from the people walking in the hallway.
She couldn't see in front of her, so she blindly trusts Yoongi to lead the way, stopping in front of a door and opening it after a couple knocks."Hobi, can you step out for a second?""Hyung, what's going on-""Just for a while, Hoseok. Please."The boy who is usually filled with smiles and brightness has a worried expression on his face as he quietly gets up from his bed, hurrying towards the two. Hoseok does as told right away, nodding and trusting his hyung to handle the situation better than he could. He promises not to tell anyone about what he saw, and [Name] feels thankful when she hears Yoongi close the door shut.She expected him to pry, he was the type to do that, but she feels even more grateful when he simply sits on his bed, allowing her to collect herself while she sat quietly beside the window and used a lot of the tissues. She couldn't think of one thing to say to him, even a simple thank you felt like an understatement, and she sat quietly, trying to focus on making her breathing come back to normal instead of recalling Jungkook's words.When she turns around to glance at Yoongi, he looks away back to his phone. He was obviously worried, but she didn't want him to be. It didn't involve him, why was she doing this to him and bothering him in the first place?[Name] stands up, collecting the tissues she had used up and turns back to walk out."Don't leave this room until you've calmed down." Yoongi's voice calls, and she pauses, nervously walking to where the recycling bin was and throwing the tissues away."Don't leave. Don't." He warns again, only making [Name]'s lips tremble as she tries to hold in a sob.She couldn't even think of where to start her explanation...But Yoongi didn't want one, he simply wanted her to be fine, and that makes her heart cry even more. How could a human be so sincere?She finds herself walking back towards the window, and she sits again, watching outside at the view of the beach she had been to a couple days ago with Jungkook.Everything around her suddenly reminded her of Jungkook, it wasn't even fair anymore.

Jungkook felt horrible, and as the days passed on, he felt worse.[Name] didn't speak to him at all, even during the flight when they, by some coincidence, had paired seats. And yet, there was silence for five hours, painful silence, because Jungkook wasn't sure what he could say, and he didn't think [Name] wanted to hear anything he had to say, either.Her headphones never left her ears and Jungkook noticed Yoongi becoming a little protective over the girl. He was too afraid to ask if his hyung knew, he felt ashamed, and Taehyung was upset while Jimin tried to come up with various ideas to fix the problem."[Name], let's go." There is a gummy smile on his face as Yoongi appears to view. The flight had landed, people were getting up, and it was only because of the elder one's words that Jungkook looked away from the window, his attention now on [Name] who nods, getting up.Yoongi waits for [Name] to walk out first, and Jungkook slowly reaches for his backpack in the compartment above him. Namjoon and Seokjin pass by as well, and the younger boy gets off, feeling lousy and like he had wasted a perfect five hours where he could have tried to convince her that what he said were just random blurting-outs.It was a whole new level of chaos after they got out of the airport. First of all, their actual flight of a day earlier got delayed to today, and the fact that their concert was today made everything hectic, getting the boys to the venue for immediate rehearsals, timing and setting up the equipment...And even though [Name] still felt sour from earlier, she picks herself up, Jungkook's feelings were justified, after all. Nothing was going to change it, and her being a moping mess would not make anything better.Which was why, she volunteered to help out right away, even before the actual concert where she was needed.The director seems a little hesitant, but seeing how willing she is and remembering her help at the previous concert, she is assigned the role of a backstage crew.Clipboard in hand, she runs to the back, where Hoseok and Jimin are doing some kind of little dance to a song while Taehyung films the two. Hoseok gives a smile when he sees [Name], and she asks if they need anything. Jimin politely requests for some water, and she goes to the storage room, taking out a couple bottles on her way, balancing the clipboard over hear head before she rushes to the older male.Hoseok is busy laughing at the clipboard, and [Name] finds herself joining him, losing her balance and the bottles fall down, along with the clipboard."Hobi-oppa, look what you've done." She accuses, unable to hide the smile while she collects the bottles quickly.Another staff member appears and calls for the three, and before she runs off along with them, she asks [Name] to get Jungkook and Namjoon's stylists ready. Nodding, she heads to the back room again, her little chores helping ever so much and she didn't feel so lousy anymore.At least, until Jungkook dashes into the room, his forehead dripping from sweat while he tries to catch his breath.Averting her eyes and walking towards where Namjoon's stylist was at, she greets the older man that follows behind Jungkook. She takes out a bottle from the bag she has been carrying out, and she walks towards Jungkook's desk as well, placing another one there before she walks out.Correction, as she tried to.By then, there is so much tension in the air that Jungkook loses it, one hand wrapped around the bottle while the other grabs hold of [Name]'s wrist.His stylist looks confused, but the staff that is yelling outside to hurry makes her proceed with her task of wiping his forehead and fixing his hair again.Which was distracting, and Jungkook gets a little irritated that he couldn't see [Name]'s face, so he simply says a single sentence before he lets go."I'll wait outside after this is over, please wait for me, [Name]."She doesn't move, does not turn around either, but she speaks up."I'll finish later than you will, so it's alright." She says, and with that, she takes a few steps and she almost reaches the door before she hears Jungkook's voice again."I'll wait."It really bothered her.It bothered her, it hurt her heart, because there was nothing that she hated more than waiting, and that was what she had been waiting for; for him to say something to break the ice. She knew that she wouldn't be able to forget what he said even if she tried, but she could forgive him if he apologised.Maybe she should have let him do that on that day itself.She feels a little embarrassed by how she behaved then, and it wasn't fair how soft she felt towards Jungkook's concerned eyes that looks up at her with an expectant look.Dear Lord, it wasn't funny anymore, how much she loved Jungkook.   [Name] learned that she was starting to be extremely shy around Jungkook, now that she realised her own feelings towards Jungkook.Her face instantly starts to heat up when she walks outside with her backpack, at least an hour after the boys had initially left...And there Jungkook stood, leaning against the wall, dressed in a white shirt and a black jacket, his hands buried deep into the pockets of his skinny jeans.She thanks the lord that it was dark outside, she didn't want him to see her face well then. And Jungkook doesn't make an attempt to do that at first either, instead bending down and reaching for a bag that she hadn't noticed was beside his feet."It's still hot. I think. Can we eat?""Eat? Where?""Here."His answer makes her blink in surprise; there were no chairs, no tables, it was simply an empty alleyway, it even felt a bit dangerous, but Jungkook is already dragging a few boxes he had seen lying around, sitting on one before he places another one beside him.[Name]'s heart melts when he looks up at her, and she crosses her legs together as well, thanking the boy when he hands her a container of food along with a pair of chopsticks."Thanks." She says, taking a bite and realising that it was spicy noodles - which she loved so much. Had she mentioned it to him before? It made her smile a little at his thoughtful gesture, and Jungkook nods, opening up a bottle of soda and placing it between the two."I know this isn't enough," He begins, leaning against the wall a little and rubbing a finger at the corner of his lips. "But I hope you don't believe the things I say when I'm frustrated. I'm very short-tempred, and Taehyung and Jimin hyung were provoking me."There is silence, and Jungkook is too afraid to glance at her face. But he could see the motion of her hands as it circles the chopstick around the noodles."And I want you to know that I really, really care about you. If Suga-hyung does something you don't like, I'll save you." He mumbles quietly, but she heard that, and feels smitten, if she hadn't already been that before."So please don't take anything personally. I will never stop considering you as someone very precious to me."By now, [Name]'s face was probably redder than the cherry tomatoes she had for breakfast this morning, and she has to put the container of food down as she gives a little nod.Of course she was going to forgive him, he was her bias wrecker, after all."It's fine, don't worry. I'm sorry I over-reacted." She says, trying to calm herself down a little."Over-reacted? You didn't!" Jungkook takes hold of the soda can beside him as he shakes his head. "I would have reacted the same if I heard you say that about me."[Name] laughs a little, she knew that if Yoongi was around to hear that, he would yell at the boy and ask him just why on earth he would react the same way.But as they ate in silence and cleaned up...And when they put their face masks on again before stepping on the bus, she feels attacked as she watched the boy who sat at the window seat. Jungkook, who was curiously watching the scenery and the brightly lit lights that they passed, it was so amusing and he was just so beautiful.How she wished Jungkook would stop bias wrecking her; that was her excuse but she knew this was in no way related, and that just makes her feel even more attacked.The innocence of her very own first love makes her shake her head, and all she could do was blame Jungkook.

"What the fuck is wrong with you?"Yoongi seems disappointed in her, when she explains why she comes back to the hotel with Jungkook last night."I can't stay mad at him, okay? He's important to me.""Yeah and we saw how important you are to him." Yoongi points out, and this brings a sour expression on [Name]'s face. Similar to Jungkook, Yoongi wasn't good at expressing his feelings either, but he was good at ordering people around, especially [Name], since she actually listened to him...Till now, that is."That's a little hurtful, Oppa." She mumbles in response, putting her book away and sitting on his bed. Yoongi is watching her every moment with squinted eyes, and although nothing changed between him and Jungkook, he found it a little hard to talk to him after the entire ordeal.[Name] and Jungkook making up could make things better, but Yoongi feels like it's not enough."He said stuff he shouldn't have, I wouldn't trust him if I was in your place." The rapper says quietly. "And why the fuck did you say you forgave him? Do you really?"This makes [Name] pause, her own heart feels conflicted because she so badly wanted to forgive him, but it still bothers her, it still hurts her randomly, and when she sees Jungkook, she isn't able to smile at first because she's busy thinking of what he said.She'd bite her lips and force a smile with one thing in mind.
Jungkook was saying the truth, after all.
Yoongi looks like he gives up, getting off from the sofa and sitting beside her. He sees that [Name] takes out her phone, looking at the line-up for their next concert while she scribbles notes in her notebook. For a second, he wonders if asking her to work with him was a bad idea. Maybe if he didn't, she wouldn't be hurt, maybe the two would have remained really good friends and everything would have been okay.But everything was so okay up till what Jungkook said, and the thought itself makes Yoongi clench his fist; there was nothing he hated more than people being indecisive."Let's go out." He announces, getting off from the bed and tapping [Name]'s shoulder. The girl looks startled as she looks up at him, and Yoongi bends himself down a little so that his face is in front of hers.[Name] instantly moves her head a little backwards in embarrassment, and Yoongi smirks while she frantically wondered what on earth was running on her bias's head."Where?""We'll go out somewhere. We'll write there, instead of here. And oh my god, [Name], must you constantly breathe on my face?"[Name] moves her face to the right, averting her gaze because in her head she is screaming 'oh my god that's so embarrassing!' but she manages to respond with something witty; she was starting to learn some points from Yoongi, for sure."I wouldn't breathe on your face if you'd move away."Yoongi isn't able to respond, because the door flies open, and two boys step in, smiling...Or at least, they were smiling, until one of the boys instantly notices the way Yoongi moves with lightening speed- which wasn't fast enough for Jeon Jungkook to not notice."Hyung? What are you guys doing?" Jungkook asks, Hoseok is following behind him, noticing the tension between the older and the younger boy.Yoongi shrugs, his answer monotonous. "We were about to go out. Come on, [Name]."And just like each time for the past week or so, Jungkook's instant sight makes [Name]'s heart throb in a painful way, and she gets up, nodding towards Yoongi, her head still full of many doubts.Yoongi has both his hands in his pockets as he steps out. He forgets his mask, and [Name] is the one who picks it up before she follows him out. She gives a little wave to Hoseok who is smiling brightly now, and she doesn't like the look Jungkook is giving her so all she does is give him a nod before stepping out.Yoongi takes the mask and puts it on, hiding his hair fully with his hoodie. It was still a little cold, and as the two walked on the foreign South American soil, there is silence between the two. And this wasn't the kind of silence [Name] was used to and actually enjoyed, if it was with Jungkook, but this was awkward silence that makes her anxious."Wait here." The boy says, while they pass by a food stand. He returns with two skewers, and she doesn't need an army certificate to know that they were the lamb skewers that Yoongi liked so much.And so did Jungkook, and the smile on her face is rather sad when she accepts it.Even Yoongi notices. 
  Meanwhile, Hoseok does the honor of inviting Taehyung with the excuse of playing games.But that was definitely not what they did, and when Namjoon and Seokjin joins them only is when Hoseok's actual goal of grilling the maknae put into plan."I just saw Suga go out with a girl in a mask. Pretty sure it's [Name]." Seokjin has to say, and Namjoon is looking at him as if he couldn't believe just how stupid he was to not be able to recognise her by now."Most girls all look the same, okay!" He tries to argue, earning a slap from the leader. Taehyung notices the way Jungkook's lips purse together, and the young one isolates himself, getting off from Hoseok's bed where everyone was huddled around and instead, going off onto his own bed."Maknae, what's wrong?" Namjoon wants to know, and he gets no response. Jungkook is lost in his phone already.Taehyung seems like he has already marked this day as the day Jungkook will confess to having feelings for the girl, so he resorts to drastic measures, via Hoseok's help."I think Suga-hyung makes [Name] very happy.""Yeah, hyung does." Hoseok has to add, siding with Taehyung instantly. Namjoon has an unsure expression while he glances at Jungkook, who had his back facing the others."I still don't know [Name] really well, but she helps me out when I make food sometimes. I guess I'll give her seven points.""Hey, that's really rude to give ranks like that." Namjoon elbows him, and Taehyung swears that Jungkook's ears twitched at that. He was simply pretending to listen to music, Taehyung just knew."What?" Seokjin seems shocked at the leader's response as he shrugs. "It doesn't matter how many points I give, I'm pretty sure Yoongi will give her 10 points, and that's the only thing that matters around here."The other three can only blankly stare at Seokjin, who had no idea what was going on, but said something even they didn't have the guts to say so.It helps to be uncultured.And it works, Jungkook snaps right after the eldest's statement, and he sits up and takes an earbud off."Please stop doing that, Jin-hyung." He says in a small voice. "That's rude for [Name], and not just her, but it's not a nice thing to do.""What's not a nice thing is how easily Suga is able to swoon the girl you like so easily. At this stage, I feel like I should root for Suga since he's actually doing something, instead of you."Jungkook's eyes are wide, and so are the rest of the boy's. Jimin could not have picked a worse time to step inside, unaware of the tension that oozed throughout the room.And he could not have made a worse statement, as soon as he does."Look, Suga-hyung got me a lamb skewer when he went out with [Name]!"Taehyung buries his face on Hoseok's shoulder because didn't want to facepalm in front of a very shocked Jungkook whose lips are trembling as he slowly stands up."Jungkookie, where are you going?" Innocent Jimin wants to know, when the maknae stands up and makes his way towards the door. "Do you want a bite from this-"Jungkook has already left."I don't know why he never likes sharing food with me."4/7 of Bangtan simultaneously facepalms.

Jungkook's mind is a lot clearer in the next week. He's smart; he makes himself busy and he gets less time to think about things that bother him, and unwanted thoughts. He spends as much as 17 hours practising, and even when his manager and members ask him to rest, he'd walk off somewhere and blast music on full volume and practice. And Yoongi begins to be more considerate, not bringing [Name] into their shared room anymore but going to either her hotel room or outside to a random cafe', if they had time to work.The members were starting to worry about their golden maknae, and Jimin is chosen as the person to go talk to him rationally. And even though he feels pressured by the rest of his hyungs, he takes a deep breath, finding Jungkook listening to music in the lounge. "Hi, Jungkook-ah," Jimin says, sitting beside him on the couch. Jungkook looks up from his phone and raises an eyebrow, and the older boy fiddles with his fingers, afraid that he'd mess up his hyung's expecations."You should get some rest, Jungkookie," He begins, "Since we have a flight again tomorrow.""Yeah.""The hyungs are very tired, but I heard we're going to a sauna before we go.""I'll pass."Jimin does not like one-or-two-word answers, and Jungkook was the type to give that to him often but this was ridiculous. After beating around the bush for a few more unsuccessful attempts, he decides to go straight to the point."Jin-hyung asked me if you like [Name], and I said no because you said so yourself.""Good.""She got me a bag of mochi the other day saying that whenever she sees that dessert in a store, it always reminds her of me."There is a lopsided smile on Jungkook's face at this statement, and it looked like he was aware of what he was doing, because his face instantly turns back to the way it was before right afterwards."She's fun." Jimin adds, "Don't you miss her because you're busy?""I do miss her." Jungkook admits instantly, and Jimin's eyes go wide because he does not expect this response from him. Not yet, anyways. "But I'm a celebrity and she's a staff and she also works with Suga-hyung. We have seperate lives so we're both busy."Jimin finds Jungkook's response a little too logical than he usually would say so, which was why he has to take a few seconds to come up with a reply."Jin-hyung and Rapmon-hyung is out with her today because someone amongst  those two broke the binder of the big fat book she carries around.""Rapmon-hyung is a disaster!" Jungkook laughs out loud at this; he can't help it, because he knows just how much [Name] loves her notebook and he tries to picture what kind of a horrified expression would be on her face at that."Taehyung and I will be joining them at the mall later for dinner. Are you not going to join us... and continue eating from the hotel?"Jungkook falls silent again, and there is no response for a long while before Jimin gets up."I understand you, Jungkook."And then he leaves, while the younger boy looks at the way his figure disappears up to the staircase."You don't understand, Jimin-hyung." He says it quietly, like a whisper, as if someone would overhear him, but there is no one to listen to him.He knew that there would be, if he ever confided in them, but by now, all he can feel is one thing.He feels ashamed.   Bangtan's first concert of the year in America was in Newark, and the 10-hour flight to the state was just as painful as the previous one, because this time, Jungkook is afraid of saying something to upset [Name] and she falls asleep a few minutes after they board the flight. Jungkook is thankful that the duration of the flights was starting to get less and less, now that they were travelling to closer places. Taehyung lets him know that she had been busy with a lot of preparations for the concert, Jungkook has a doleful expression on his face as he watched [Name] sleep in the seat beside his.Seeing her up a little closer than before makes him take note of little features he had yet not noticed, like the way her mouth is parted open a little, and how her her cheeks are pressed against her neck rest. He thinks it's amusing, the way she's exhaling and some of her hair in front of her face moves with each exhale. He also notices that she had tanned a little, and there's a line on her arm that shows her paler skin, which wasn't usually exposed to the sun.She had been working hard, and Jungkook acknowledges this with a determined expression on his face. The staff always gave it their all to make the boys look their best on stage, so he didn't want to disappoint them - or even the fans.Before covering his face with a blanket, Jungkook decides that the US was probably the best places to buy [Name] a long-overdue gift that he wanted to get for her for so long.The problem was, he didn't know what he could get for her.   Jungkook could stay in denial for as long as he wanted to, and it seemed like it never bothered [Name] anymore, as the days went on. On the day of the concert, she has her hair tied up into a high ponytail, and even her fringe is pinned and neatly combed back.He had never seen her forehead before, and he thinks it's oddly pathetic, how amusing it looks to him. He wants to point out that she had missed a lock of hair that was loose, but she didn't look like she minded.She was on a roll today, she was even prepared, with a side bag to carry everything and not make a mess like the last time."Jungkook, you're up in thirty seconds."That was the first thing she had said to him in days - aside from the occasional hellos during breakfast - and he is pursing his lips while giving a nod. Yoongi follows right behind him, and the bright light of the stage makes him a little dizzy.After he finishes his performance and gets back to get a little rest before the next, [Name] sees that Jungkook has a very, very sour expression on his face. He looks paler than he had been earlier, and she picks up a bottle of water and hands it to him."Are you okay? Do you want something else?""No.""What's wrong?"And it makes him a little upset, how well she can read him. Why did he hurt someone who cares about him so much?"I missed a lot of steps today," Jungkook confesses, "And I practised so much.""Missing a couple of steps is not a problem," She says, taking a seat in front of him."But it is-""Because the fans who spend a lot of money and time to come to your shows are here because they love you." [Name] interrupts. "They love when you smile, they love when you dance for them, they love that you're singing for them, and most important of all... They love that you love performing for them. So even if you miss, they'd love you even more because they, just like you, are humans. And humans make mistakes."Jungkook watches the way she is looking straight at him, and for once, he doesn't feel uneasy. He calms down a little, his eyes still on [Name] as she turns back to her clipboard."It's nice to have an army around so I know how they exactly feel," Jungkook says, before he decides to rephrase his sentence."It's nice to have you around, [Name].""It's nice to have you around too, Jungkook."And the two would have continued smiling like idiots for a long time... If it wasn't for the ruckus outside.Outside, one of the crew members is yelling like crazy because Jimin won't come out of the bathroom and he's due, in a minute.Jungkook and [Name] laugh together after a long time apart.And it's a genuine laugh, and Jungkook actually is looking forward to getting called to go on stage again.[Name] lets him know that she has to go back to work, and he gives her a nod, watching the way her ponytail waved from side to side as she jogs outside.This isn't fair [Name]. It's not fair, but you've got me on a string.

Neither Yoongi, nor Jungkook, were good at expressing their feelings.They were both quiet, and maybe that was why they both got along the most, and always would beg for switches if they didn't end up being roommates.In their stay at Los Angeles, they are sharing their room together, along with Taehyung, and it's a little endearing, the way he would pout because he was full of energy and Yoongi would just lie in bed all day if he didn't have practice.But Taehyung speaks, he speaks a whole lot."Hyung, it's fun to work with [Name], right?""Yeah.""She's fun.""I know.""She's really quiet, though.""Better than you."Taehyung wants to facepalm because the conversation is going nowhere just like what Jimin had reported with Jungkook a few days ago. 5/7 of Bangtan are now in on project fix-golden-maknae, and he felt like Yoongi was the most important case when it came to the entire mission.After all, 6 was better than 5."Do you like [Name]?""Of course." Yoongi responds in between humming. "You'll like her a lot more if you hang out with her more, too.""Hyung, are you in love with her?"Taehyung feels a little scared at the glare Yoongi sends towards him, and he does not like it one bit, the way the older male takes off his headphones and continues his expressionless look at him."Taehyung, what the f-"Jeon Jungkook steps inside the room like the oblivious boy that he is, and he has a big smile on his face as he holds a plastic bag in his hand. He seems excited, and the two males inside the room from earlier watch the way he carefully places the bag inside his suitcase."Jungkookie, what do you have there?""It's my present for [Name]," He explains with a smile. It took him this long, and he feels like it's the perfect gift for her. Yoongi has a pleased look on his face. "When are you giving it to her?""After our last concert in the States." Jungkook responds, showing a glimpse of the present to the two. Taehyung lets out a low whistle, and Yoongi seems proud as he gives a nod; he understands exactly why he got her the gift that he did."Hey Jungkook, wanna know something she told me, yesterday?""What is it, Hyung?"Yoongi has a smile on his face when he sees the curiosity on Jungkook's face. He didn't need a certificate on Jungkook psychology to know how he was feeling, and as much as he felt the need to keep [Name] away from the maknae, he was starting to loosen a little."She said she really loves the Interlude."Jungkook raises an eyebrow, he couldn't understand what his purpose of saying that was."Wings Interlude?""Yeah. She's always playing that on repeat, now. She even dabs during my rap." He adds, making the younger boy chuckle. "It's a shame she can't be in a concert even though she really wants to be in one."Jungkook simply blinks, it was a pity, after all. But [Name] didn't really seem to mind, and besides, he knew from the other stage members that she would peek from backstage and lowkey dance because she loved the music so much.And while the maknae gets lost in thoughts and smiles to himself, Yoongi continues to look at him expectantly while he remains oblivious."Even Taehyung understood what I was hinting, Jungkook." He finally speaks, and Jungkook looks up from his phone, in confusion."What?""I have a plan."   The concert was as hectic as ever, and [Name] had been running around from floor to floor, room to room, back from the storage room and out to the waiting area. One would think she would start to get used to the level of hyper as she worked there more, but Bangtan's concerts are never normal.The members finish their concert and are heading backstage, when they hear the fans begging for an encore. As usual. And just like every other time, the boys are always, always ready to do what their fans would say, and they have the perfect song ready for it.Before stepping on stage again, they are getting sips of water when Yoongi calls for [Name]. She comes running with her humungous bag, wondering what he wanted. The seven boys are smiling at her while Taehyung takes away her clipboard and hands it to one of the crew members behind them."Noona, can you take her along with you?" Jimin asks politely, and the woman nods, taking hold of [Name]'s hand while she blinks in confusion."Wait, I still have to check whether to m-""Bye, [Name]." The boys call, while she gets dragged out, and she could swear that she hears Seokjin's windshield laughs as she blinks in even more confusion.The woman takes her to the crowd, right in front of the stage, and takes out an army bomb from her bag, handing it to [Name]."Bangtan wants you to be an army instead of a stage crew, just for this song at least." The woman, who was Jimin's stylist, has to say. [Name]'s jaw drops open while the cheers from behind her grow louder, and she looks up at the stage to see that the boys climb up there with mikes in hand."This song is for a special friend of Jungkook and I." Yoongi has to say, pausing a little as he scans through the crowd. "And also.. for all of our backstage staff who works just as hard as we do.""Thank you for all your hard work, we really appreciate it." Jungkook adds, and [Name] could swear that he has his gaze right where she stood - Was this all planned?She has tears in her eyes when the music for the wing interlude begins to play from the speakers. And all while trying her hardest to compose herself, she turns the army bomb's light on, ready to join the fan chants with the thousands of others behind her.Hoseok and Taehyung are mocking her when she raises her hands at the chorus, they are copying her lame steps, and she can't help but to laugh because dear god, Bangtan Sonyeondan is simply the best boyband that could ever exist.

Jungkook feels proud when he sees a teary-eyed, smiling [Name] running up to him and his bandmates, who are resting backstage."Oh my God." She whispers, her glance going from Jungkook to Yoongi, and then to every other member. "I'm going to die because I'm so happy."Yoongi blinks at the girl with an amused expression on his face, wrapping an arm over her shoulder. The girl stops freaking out after this, her eyes a little wide as she looks at her bias in surprise. By now, most of the other members have gone back to their rooms to change, but Jungkook...He looks from [Name] to Yoongi, and then back again, in discomfort."Uh. Uh, so. I have a present for you." Jungkook blurts out, sprinting towards his room to fetch the bag. When he gets back, he sees that [Name] is laughing at something the rapper had said, and Yoongi had taken the hint and now had his hands in his pockets."Ah, Kookie!" Her glance falls to the box in his hand, and she purses her lips a little. "You didn't have to get me a present, the Interlude was more than enough for me!"Jungkook shakes his head, while he extends his arms out towards her, box clutched tightly in his grip."I did.""No, you didn't have to.""No, I had t-"There is a noisy 'tsk-tsk' from behind them - Yoongi, who yawns as he looks at the two."Kids.""Yah! Why are you like this?" [Name] mumbles under her breath, and both the boys blink in utter surprise."Did you just say 'Yah'? I'm your Oppa, learn some manners, [Name]."The two teenagers blink in even more surprise, afraid that Yoongi was mad -But the rapper simply shakes his head, ruffling her hair playfully, instead."I'm going to go rest. Thanks for the hard work, [Name]. See you later."The two exchange a glance while Yoongi walks off, and Jungkook awkwardly points to the bench. The girl nods in response, and the two sink onto the bench and let out heavy sighs."Hyung doesn't seem to get mad at you " Jungkook mutters, while [Name] takes the box he is holding out, in hand."Yoongi-oppa is mean. But at the end of the day, he's still one of the most amazing people I've ever had the chance to meet. He- Oh."She stops when she lifts the lid of the box, and Jungkook wasn't sure which he was smirking for - The fact that his gift had rendered her speechless, or the fact that his gift got her to quit her compliments towards his hyung.[Name] picks up the smaller packet inside, revealing a neatly folded pair of earphones."You always have your ones on. And I see that they change a lot, since you probably buy fake ones all the time." Jungkook tries to explain. "So I thought I'll get you one that's really good. I've been using that brand for a while, and it's very cool.""Oh, Jungkookie, this is my favourite colour..." Her voice trails as she turns to look at him. And she continues to blink at him in shock, making Jungkook flush crimson red before he looks out to some of the backstage staff who had started to take down the equipment."And... The ones you're using now, they let us hear what you're listening to. And you've been listening to my cover of Rainism a lot, recently."The gasp he hears from beside him makes him grin a bit, turning to face [Name] whose cheeks have gone pale pink."On repeat," He adds."You're so rude." She mumbles, making Jungkook's eyes go wide."I didn't mean it like th-""Oh, we say rude when our bias, or bias wrecker - or anyone, for that matter - teases us and stuff. You're actually a nice person." She explains, smiling when Jungkook eases a little with the explanation. "Thank you so much, Jeon Jungkook. I'll try to keep this carefully forever.""You're welcome, [Name]. Thank you for all your efforts. In our next show, can you bring me some of those banana chips too, like you did today?""Of course."The two exchange toothy smiles, before they walk off on their separate ways.  "Rats. Rats. Rats." [Name] is continuously chanting, as she taps on the screen of her smartphone. Taehyung is the one who answers the door, and she steps in with a small greet. Jungkook is sprawled on the sofa, playing a game with Hoseok, who pauses it upon seeing the girl."Hi!""Hello, Hobi-oppa. Is Yoongi-oppa still in bed?""As usual."Taehyung pats the seat beside his, on the sofa, and Jungkook watches the way she sits down aimlessly, still tapping her phone."What are you doing, [Name]?" The younger boy wants to know, and she sighs, facing Jungkook."I'm trying to revive my twitter account.""Oh? You don't use it often?""Yes. But now I need it to vote for you guys but I think there's a problem with my phone."Taehyung offers to help, while Jungkook simply blinks, analysing her words."Vote? Are we nominated for an online website or something, again?"[Name]'s eyes go wide as if she couldn't believe her ears. Before she can speak up, there is a loud screeching noise, followed by Namjoon and Seokjin, who runs up to the living room."Guys! Bang PD-nim just said that we're nominated for a billboard award!!"There is another loud screaming noise (from Hoseok), a loud gasp (by Taehyung), a loud drop of a plate (by Jimin in the kitchen), and the entire room is just very loud in general as the boys huddle together for a group hug."Min Yoongi, get up and join us, for crying out loud!!"[Name] is teary-eyed as she runs to Yoongi's room, slightly appalled at seeing him sleeping peacefully through the ruckus."Oppa." She pokes, and Yoongi cracks an eye open with a glare."[Name], what is wrong with you? Get off me-""Get up if you want a billboard award."Min Yoongi had never gotten off from bed so fast.And that is how he runs to join the group hug, 7/7 of Bangtan Sonyeondan cheering (and some sobbing) while they tried to get over the shock."Hi, so I'll come back later," [Name] whispers to Taehyung, who still has her phone in his clutches. The boy nods, giving the device back to her."I think you can log in now," Taehyung informs, while Jungkook appears to see [Name] put her shoes back on."Oh, you fixed it?""Yeah.""I love you." She says, in all seriousness, bowing her head a little before she dashes outside.Taehyung looks back at the younger maknae with an amused expression on his face, and he was sure that Jungkook would be internally yelling right about now."Your [Name] just said 'I love you' to me.""Shut up, Hyung."

Even as she sits backstage, [Name] is a teary-eyed mess while she sees the boys wrap up their tour. Their final show in Manila ended just as successfully as their previous ones, and the boys are all tired, yet restless about their Billboard nomination."I can't believe it, still," Hoseok says, taking the soft drink [Name] offers with a grateful smile. "Yoongi-hyung mentioned Billboards in Agust D, and a year later, boom.""Do you think we'll win?""Of course you'll win! Don't underestimate us!" The girl blurts out, and Jungkook laughs before he faces his hyungs."By 'us', she is referring to the ARMY," He explains, earning laughs from the rest of the band members."Well, even if we win or not, I think being nominated, on its own, is pretty amazing. So let's just enjoy our time, yeah?" Namjoon extends a hand out, and [Name] is melting while she watches all seven of the boys cheer together, hands over each others as they grinned from ear to ear.  Jimin isn't sure of what to say, when he steps outside with Jungkook and finds [Name] sitting on the bench in front of the hotel; phone clutched tightly in hand.Now, Jimin didn't need a pass in Jungkook's-feelings-exams to know how he felt about the girl. It was very obvious in the way Jungkook's face lights up, and how he crosses the street to her, leaving poor Jimin at the other side."[Name], what are you up to?" Jungkook wants to know, and the girl looks up at the boy, lowering her face mask to reveal a frustrated expression."I just reached the vote limit," She says, turning to Jimin who reaches the two who are now seated on the bench. "Hello, Jimin-oppa.""The vote limit?""Oh. Yes. I can only vote 100 times on both twitter and Facebook. This is the most frustrating thing in the world." She explains, holding her phone's screen up. Jungkook chuckles when he sees the screen showing an error pop-up."I'm thankful that you voted this much, for us.""And I'd vote more if this stupid-"There's a little cough before Jimin takes a few steps back. He then glances at the younger boy with a smile on his face."Jungkook-ah, now that [Name] is here, can you go get the drinks with her instead?"He doesn't wait for a reply, and the girl can hear Jungkook curse under his breath."Hyung is mean.""Um, well, I finished voting, and I can't vote anymore until tomorrow, so uh. It's fine. I'll go buy the thingies with you "It's almost 11pm, and it's very dark, in an entirely foreign land, and all these thoughts at once makes Jungkook flush red before he gets up with a loud 'No!'."I mean... It's fine! I can go on my own! And besides, w-"He shuts up instantly when [Name] tugs on his jacket a little, while standing up."Please. I haven't had the time to explore, this is the least we can do and get away with it."Jungkook was sure that his hyungs and his manager would be mad at him for coming back so late, but when the girl clumsily begins to pull his jacket again, he simply bites his bottom lip; It was an attempt to hide the goofy grin forming on his face.The two are walking in silence, the only noise being the occasional vehicles that pass by, and the sound of their shoes on the pavement. Jungkook feels a little nostalgic at the peacefulness, and he keeps on walking for a long while before the girl comes to a halt."Wait, where are we going?"Its a little past 11pm, there's people jogging around and it's dark and a little eerie but they can see the city lights and their hotel's name board all lightened up behind them. And as they stood, looking at each other like two dumbasses, Jungkook just knows.He knows that it's the best time to tell her how he was feeling recently, and that he hoped that she felt the same way.How he'd read so many manga and how the super cool heroes in it would have a little arc along the way where they're so smitten over an equally amazing female character...How [Name] was that amazing girl of his life and how he's so insanely smitten."Jungkook?"[Name] waves a hand in front of his face, and the boy breaks into a lopsided smile."Jungk--""It's over there." He points, and the girl follows his finger which is pointed at a convenience store a few blocks ahead.Maybe next time, Jungkook decides. For now, he softly exhales, enjoying the way she has a hard time deciding what kind of drink to buy.  "Hyung! I brought you the drink you asked."Jungkook opens the door to their room and sees the black-haired male tapping on his tablet, earphones plugged in."Thanks." Yoongi takes the can, opening it up and taking a sip as he sees Jungkook's face visibly glowing."Have you been out with her?"Jungkook almost coughs up his drink. In fact, he even feels his nose fizz up a bit."What?""Three months is enough time right?"The maknae can only blink in surprise; he's confused because Yoongi is making no sense."Hyung?""Jungkook-ah, let's talk about [Name]."The younger boy falls silent because he can feel his cheeks flushing at the mention. He takes a quick sip of his drink to hide his face."I'll ask this once and I want you to be honest with me. Because if you say the wrong reply, I might do something you, me, and even [Name] will regret later on.""Don't... Don't make it sound so scary, Hyung...""Are you in love with her?""Why-""Are you?" Yoongi repeats. Jungkook averts his eyes, chugging down the rest of his soda while trying to analyze the older male's words. He's a little tired of hearing everyone ask him the same thing all the time, and he hates how flustered he feels no matter how many times it happens."Are you?" Yoongi asks again, earphones plugged off and his full concentration landing on the younger boy.Jungkook had never felt so tied down before."I... I don't know, Hyung.""You're not sure?"Jungkook only nods in defeat, watching how Yoongi continues blinking at him."Then you won't mind me taking [Name] out right?""Hyung, why w-""You're alright with me asking her to date me?""Hyung n-""So," Yoongi goes on interrupting. "I have the permission to kiss her?""Hyung!"It wasn't an ordinary yell, it was a loud shriek. Jungkook has his hands over his ears, his empty can of soda now on the floor while he breathes heavily."Why are you doing this?""Get on your bed and go to sleep, Jungkook.""Answer me.""I don't know, Jungkook-ah," Yoongi say, his voice as grim as the younger male's. "It's just like you said. I don't know."Jungkook feels his heart crumble as the older male wraps his blanket over his face and turn away.The lights are off, there's no sound, and while he stayed with his favorite Hyung...Jungkook had never felt so alone.

Jungkook found that it was starting to get harder for him to meet eyes with both Yoongi, and [Name], since that day.He had gone back to his excessive practising to console himself, and even Taehyung and Jimin were starting to notice the maknae's odd behaviours.The voting for the Billboards was insane, and the boys are bubbling with joy when they receive the invitation to head to the awards show."Can you believe it, [Name]? We're going to Billboards." Yoongi has to say, sinking into the couch with his laptop in hand. The girl gives a nod, the two of them had been working on music for a while now, and Hoseok and Taehyung, who had overheard them, had come out to the living room with the excuse of playing games. Even when Jimin mentioned that [Name] was around, Jungkook refused to step outside, instead going to the kitchen where Seokjin is trying to look up a recipe for sweet potatoes and lamb meat.Jungkook can hear the girl laughing in between, amused by Hoseok's excessive bubbliness which was just as loud as it is on camera. After a while, Yoongi gets distracted, plugging off his headphones and joining the two boys who are playing games on the other side of the room."Oppa, can I listen to these tracks you have?" [Name] asks, and Yoongi gives a little nod."Go ahead. Listen to anything you want, but don't even think of listening to track number 56.""What's track number 56?" It's Taehyung who calls, enthusiasm radiating as he hurries towards where the girl sits at the desk with Yoongi's laptop."[Name], I'll trust that you won't listen to it, or even let Taehyung touch it.""Yes, fine." She responds, and Taehyung swears that he'll find out what it is later, when the girl leaves. There's a lot of music on Yoongi's folders, most of them are simply music tracks with no lyrics in them that she guesses that the rapper had produced in his free time. A while afterwards, she turns to face the three who are playing a multiplayer game on the large-screen TV."Hoseok-oppa, where's Jungkookie?"Taehyung brightens up instantly, pointing towards the kitchen while exchanging a glance with Hoseok who nods, dimples showing as he gives a big smile.Excusing herself, [Name] walks towards the door, knocking on it a little.As soon as she is out of earshot, Taehyung pokes Yoongi's shoulder a little."Did you... Ask [Name] out or something?""What?" Yoongi looks irritated as he shakes his head, focusing back on the game."Then... Did you and Jungkook have a fight?"Yoongi doesn't bother to respond this time, shaking his head a little again."It's hard to tell if anything has happened between you two, because neither of you are the type to talk about anything." Taehyung mumbles with a frown. Hoseok shakes his head, motioning for him to let it go, and there's a noise from the hallway, when Seokjin finally opens the door to the kitchen."Ah good. Come here, chop those cabbages with Jungkook." Chef Seokjin says, pulling the girl inside, and the maknae's eyes go wide as he turns around and blinks at her in surprise. Seokjin hands her a knife, and [Name] is biting her bottom lip to try to hide her smile, and she walks beside Jungkook."Hi.""Hello.""Should I cut this one?" She asks, picking up one of the vegetables from the bag in front of him. Jungkook nods, and the two begin chopping the cabbages in silence."Do you two seriously never talk when you're alone?" Seokjin wants to know, and Jungkook's eyes go wide again as he grunts in frustration. How awkward can this get?But when he sees that [Name] is smiling, he simply sighs, amused at how she found the situation funny."Curses. I need more potatoes. I'll be back in a few." Seokjin says, taking off his apron and stepping outside. The two go back to their silent cooking adventures, and it takes sweet time before [Name] is the one who speaks up."You're going to LA in a few days.""Yeah... I can't believe it.""Well, you better believe it. Me and the rest of the army will continue voting for you guys."Jungkook smiles in response, and the girl takes another half of the cabbage, and they go back to their work. Seokjin has a bored expression on his face when he enters to see that they are doing absolutely no communication whatsoever, and he wants to yell and ask Taehyung why on earth he even thought they got along in the first place. [Name] was definitely more active when Yoongi was around, and vice-versa."Hey, [Name], do you believe the saying that opposites attract?" Seokjin pulls a bold card, and Jungkook seems to have taken the hint, looking at [Name] with an alarmed expression on his face. But the girl looks up from her task with her eyes gleaming, and Jungkook figures that she likes the topic related to love and dating was something she really liked to talk about."Yeah, sometimes. There are other times when similar people get along more, too.""Like you and Jungkook?"The maknae shoots a glare at his hyung between gritted teeth, and Seokjin bursts into laughter and waves for the girl to come near the stove. The girl gives a nod, walking to the older male, where she whispers a small 'yes'. Seokjin's eyes go wide, and he checks to see if Jungkook was eavesdropping-And he wasn't. [Name] did that on purpose, he just knew."You have a thing for our Jungkookie, don't you?" He whispers, to which the girl almost drops the ladle of soup in her hand. She frantically glances to the maknae who was busy attacking the vegetables, and she lets out a small sigh."I didn't think it was that obvious.""Believe me, it's very obvious. You both obviously like each other, but you guys don't bother talking about these kind of things.""It's not that... It's just that I'm happy just being around him, you know? And I think... I feel like - and I hope I'm right- that he likes being around me too, because we can simply sit on a bench just looking at the cars passing, without talking to each other... but it still is fun, in its own way."Seokjin takes a bite out of the potatoes he's prepared, nodding a little while he pats [Name]'s head gently."I take it back. I'll give you 9 points.""What?""Nothing. Do me a favour, and make sure you explain to Jungkook, the difference between a 'bias' and 'someone you love'. If he hears you explain it, I think it'll help him a lot."[Name] seems a little unsure of why Seokjin would ask her to do such a task, but she simply nods anyways, and goes back to her original task of slicing the veggies.And they're done in a while, and [Name] waves to a slightly flustered Jungkook before she steps out to the living room...Only to see that Yoongi is alseep, a younger Taehyung resting his head on the older's shin. Making sure that she locks Yoongi's laptop and turns it off, she says her goodbye to Hoseok, and leaving before the polite Seokjin would ask her to join them for food.Because really, Bangtan was a family, and they deserved to have their own meals every once in a while.She couldn't wait to go to Los Angeles with them in a few days, and she prayed that they will win the award. And even if they didn't, she knew that they would always remain the best band, the best family, and the best group of seven beautiful men that she would never regret stanning.

[Name] seems to be in a very good mood when she steps into the arena with candy-filled bags in hand the next day.Bangtan Sonyeondan was holding a thousand-fans-only show on short notice, on occasion of their Billboard nomination. The setup was completed, and Hoseok starts to eat the candy as soon as he is handed one of the bags.Jungkook steps outside a few minutes later, fully dressed and made-up, and he nods a little, greeting the girl who hands him a piece of candy. In the back, Seokjin and Namjoon are busy trying to get Jimin to teach a step, and Yoongi looks bored, holding his phone in hand while he listened to something."Hey, [Name], do you have a boyfriend?"Six heads turn to the girl, who has her eyes widened as she looked at who had said that. What was the most amusing was the fact that the person who said it, Yoongi, didn't even look up from his phone."Hyung, that's kinda mean to ask directly-" Jimin begins to protest, and Seokjin puts a hand over his shoulder which shuts the younger boy up. All eyes then land on Jungkook, who has his eyes furrowed as he looks at Yoongi with a pained expression on his."What are you talking about?" Hoseok is the one who breaks the tension, draping an arm around the girl's shoulder. Jungkook and Taehyung blink at the older male in surprise, who continues. "Don't you remember? Every Army has at least one boyfriend, and that's one of us, who ever her bias is.""[Name]'s bias is Yoongi-hyung."Jungkook looks a little sick as he turns to face the girl next, who cracks a little smile and shakes her head."Yes, but I don't have a boyfriend." She says, her gaze going to Seokjin while she remembers what he had told her earlier. "And um, there's a difference between a bias and someone you love."Seokjin takes the hint, his eyes going wide and with newfound curiosity, he walks a little closer to the girl, pulling Hoseok away from the girl and pushing him to where Taehyung is standing. Jungkook blinks a little in surprise, watching his hyung cross his arms on his chest while he looked down at the girl with the bags of candy in hand."What's the difference? Guys, it's going to be explained by a fellow army!" For some reason, Jimin, Taehyung, and Hoseok are laughing, and Namjoon looks done with the rest of the members and had gone to practice in a corner."Um well, a bias is someone we respect, we fangirl over, and someone we will love from far away. He's an ideal person, that's why we always end up having a bias," She explains, looking at Seokjin who nods, encouraging her to go on."But... When we love someone, we can't bear to stay far away from the person."There's loud 'Ohhhhhhhh's and 'Aaaaaaah's coming from the boys, and Seokjin gives a big grin in approval, his eyes then landing on Jungkook, who had taken a seat and was sipping water, looking down at his feet as he did so."Thank you," Seokjin whispers, before he then pulls Jimin and Hoseok along with him as he went back to the changing room. Taehyung gives a smile to [Name] before he follows the older males."Does that answer your question, Oppa?" The girl looks at Yoongi with a sheepish smile, who gives a nod. [Name] then walks back to the storage room, back to her task to retrieve her clipboard. Jungkook continues to sip water silently, for a while before he puts the bottle down and faces Yoongi, who is seated in front of him."Hyung.""Yeah?""I love [Name]."At that, Yoongi looks up from his phone, taking off his earphones, his eyes going a little wide even, while he gives a small smile."Well, it's about time you admitted to that.""I love [Name]," Jungkook repeats, his gaze going to the door of the storage room, before going back to Yoongi again. "So I'm going to ask her out. I don't know what she will say, but-""You're dense as fuck. It's been months, for crying out loud. We've all known that you like her, but you keep on denying and that's fucking annoying." Yoongi gets up, his voice going a little lower as he sits beside the maknae. He didn't want anyone to overhear them, and there were a lot of people around, setting up."But... Aren't you angry at me?""Why would I be angry at you? Because your brain is the size of a pea?""... What. No, because you also lov-"Yoongi shakes his head, wrapping his arm around Jungkook's and pulling the boy in for a small hug."I just like her, as a person. There's a difference. She's an amazing person, and I'm glad to have met her. She's easy to talk to and she isn't annoying... You know this better than me." There's a gummy smile on Yoongi's face when he realises that he's blabbing. "You're the one in love with her. So I want you to stop being indecisive as fuck and just tell her how you feel, instead of stressing yourself till your feet gets calloused."Neither of the two was good at expressing their feelings, but they felt warm as they exchanged a hug; because they knew that at times like this, times when they needed one another, they would always, always be there for each other.And in between the show, while Jungkook had stepped into his changing room to get his hair re-fixed again, he sees [Name] in a corner, aggressively tapping her phone.She's voting for them again, and there's a smile on Jungkook's face when he realises that. He couldn't wait to go to Las Vegas, and he even had a nice idea of what he'd do, if he won. --- [Name] had injured her toe during the last show, so she looked awful as she hauled herself to the airport with the rest of the staff. Bangtan Sonyeondan was finally heading off to America for the show, and the number of fans she sees even before she steps out of the car makes her put on her face mask and adjust the beanie over her head.Of all the days that the two could have adjacent seats, Jungkook looks a little pissed that her seat this time was beside Seokjin's.But the fact that he had decided on confessing makes his feel at ease.He couldn't wait.

The boys continuously kept on getting invited for an interview after interview, as their lead in the polls kept increasing. Bangtan Sonyeondan found it a little tough to catch up with their rest, and they let out heavy sighs when their manager takes them out for a small seafood restaurant.After their meal, Taehyung is eyeing the maknae, who goes to the counter and asks for a takeout. He speaks in broken English, but the woman seems to understand him, mumbling something to him before she heads to the kitchen door."What are you doing?""I'm taking some food for [Name]." He has to say, putting his credit card back into his wallet as he sits down beside Taehyung."But she's going to eat the same thing later, Bang pd-nim said he's getting them food too.""Well, he has one less to pay now."Jimin has a smile of approval on his face while he listens to the two speaking, as he holds his leftover pack of fish and rice. "Jungkookie is growing up."There's a faint redness on Jungkook's cheeks when Jimin says that, and he reaches for the camera around his neck, excusing himself to 'go take pictures' outside. He is busy taking a picture of a cat that was stretching near the back door of the restaurant, when Namjoon pops into view."So, I heard.""Hyung, please.""No, no. Don't worry, I'm not here to tease you," Namjoon laughs, reaching his hand out to pet the cat. The feline responds with a hiss, and both the males laugh as they watch the cat run away."You didn't let me take a proper shot, hyung."Namjoon places a hand over Jungkook's shoulder, smiling as he does so. The two exchange a smile, before he gets up on his feet, and Jungkook follows his leader, the two of them entering the restaurant again. The woman at the counter hands Jungkook his takeaway, and the boys are cheering the flustered maknae, who takes his phone out to text the girl."Please stop it." Jungkook whines, as the boys get inside the van. "He's barely become an adult but he's already going to go get the girls.""Why did you make it plural? His heart is only with-""Can you all just leave the kid alone?" Yoongi slaps Jimin's back a little, interrupting him as he does so. "He's gonna do the right thing after ten million years, so I'll kill all of you if he backs out thanks to your stupid comments."The males are too afraid to even respond, and all Jungkook can do is give a big fat, grateful smile to Yoongi. --- [Name] wasn't sure what to blame, for her heart racing as soon as she sees the boys pile out of the van. Standing on the balcony, she sighs loudly, walking back inside to head downstairs. When she comes down, she sees that everyone had already left upstairs to rest, and Jungkook stands outside, leaning by a tree in front of the hotel with a plastic bag in hand."Hi, [Name].""Hi, Jungkook." She greets, breaking into a smile when she sees that the boy is also smiling as well."I got you some seafood. Do you want to go somewhere and eat?" He asks, pulling his face mask back up on his face. "Remember, you made me promise that I'll go out somewhere with you when we were on tour, but we kinda never did that...""You're right. Okay, let's go." [Name] nods, walking beside Jungkook. She notices him flinching slightly when her hand brushes against his jacket, and she ends up giggling; Jungkook was just too cute. Internally, Jungkook wanted to kill himself for being an awkward mess, but he just didn't know how else he could deal with the fact that his mind was completely blank."There's no way I can do it today...""What did you say?""Nothing!" Jungkook replies, his eyes going wide and he walks a little ahead so that she wouldn't notice his face was completely red. When he remembers that he still has his face mask on, he wants to slap himself for being an idiot.The two had walked in silence, occasionally pointing to posters and other shops on their way, eventually finding a children's park. There are swings on one side, a sandbox, and monkey bars, which make the two of them exchange an excited glance. There was a park that looked exactly the same as the one right in front of their high school.The nostalgia makes them smile, and Jungkook lowers his face mask, amused as he walks a little closer to the monkey bars. He then holds out the bag to the girl, who takes it, and Jungkook climbs up onto the bars."Woah, what are you doing?""These are really fun, you should try it." He has to say, as he holds himself up from one of the bars and tries to grab the next one."I'd rather have my limbs intact."This makes Jungkook laugh, his concentration dropping for a second and he lands down on his feet, teeth showing as he laughed."Just once.""No." [Name] takes two steps back, and Jungkook sighs. He wanted to get on top of the bars, and when he glances at the girl, he was sure that she had figured out what he had planned.Two minutes later, Jungkook is seated comfortably, on top of the metal bars, his legs crossed as he smiles down at the girl."You know, I'm really thankful you bought me seafood, but I'm going to the swing to eat this." She calls, making her way back - - And stopping when she sees a huge dog running inside the park."That looks dangerous, hurry and come up here before it bites you." Jungkook calls, trying to stop himself from smiling. But the terrified expression on [Name]'s face is too amusing, and he is laughing as he holds his hand out to the girl."But...""Just come up. I'm closer to the stars than you are." Jungkook calls, holding his hand out. He expects the girl to put her hand in his and climb up, but all she does is put the bag back in his hand."What are you doing?" He calls, blinking in surprise when the girl pulls her sleeves up a little before stepping on one of the bars. "Oh my God."[Name] places a foot on the next bar, climbing up to the top with ease, and Jungkook continues blinking as he watches, not moving."Jungkookie, can I get some space?""Oh! Oh yeah!" Jungkook shakes his head as he moves to the other side slightly, and the girl sits down, her feet hanging beside his while she sighs."I thought you were the kind of person who would be too... Shy and too frail to do that.""I didn't think you were so sexist." She has to respond, taking the bag from his clutches. The two burst out laughing, and with every passing minute, Jungkook feels less like digging a hole and sobbing.Sitting on top of a monkey bar and eating little bits of meat from the takeout was definitely the first time he had so much fun in ages, and he was really excited for the Billboard Awards that would be on tomorrow.And as the two walked back home, their legs barely had any energy to carry themselves up to their rooms. And yet, the smiles on their faces are just as wide as they had been, when they first met up.And as he lay on bed, after getting ready for bed, he couldn't wait for tomorrow.And the Awards show was only a small part of it.

There is an excessively nervous Jeon Jungkook, seated in the middle of his bed, with one thought running on his head.Today.It was finally the day. The day for the Billboard Awards Show.The stylists and makeup artists were running around and collecting everything necessary, and the chaos outside was so loud that Yoongi and Jungkook had retired to their rooms for peace. Yoongi was taking a nap, and Jungkook was sure that his hyung would wake up with a groggy face and demand for some coffee while he was getting ready later.Jimin had even gone ahead to get a haircut, and his own stylist had done a little trimming of his split ends, earlier. The boys had finished using their face masks last night; in fact, Taehyung had fallen asleep with his on, and Hoseok had to clean his face up and tuck him to sleep on the couch without waking the younger one up.As Jungkook sat, resting up for the long day ahead, he wonders what [Name] would be up to, right about now. It makes him take a deep breath, sending a text to her.
'Where are you?'
He gets a response within seconds.
'In the lounge with Namjoon-oppa.'
Taking his earphones along, he exits his room, closing the door and walking downstairs to the lounge. As told, [Name] is sitting beside Namjoon, and Jungkook sees that she has a notebook in her lap while she makes scribbles as the leader went on speaking."Hi, guys." Jungkook calls, coming up to them. The girl looks up and smiles, and Namjoon points to the other end of the couch, motioning to Jungkook to go sit there, beside [Name]. Feeling slightly flustered, he heads there anyways, sitting down before he asks, "What are you doing?""Namjoon-oppa was nervous about what to say, in case you guys win. He asked me to double check if the speech he prepared was alright." [Name]'s voice goes a little lower before she faces Namjoon, her lips pursed a little. "But the thing here is that there is absolutely nothing wrong with your speech. Your vocabulary is just perfect the way you are, Oppa."Namjoon doesn't seem convinced, and Jungkook takes the paper from her hand and reads a bit of what had been scribbled in hangul."Hyung, please don't worry too much. It's fine if you make a couple mistakes, it doesn't change the fact that you are our leader, that you are a member of Bangtan, and the fact that every army loves you so much. You can actually speak the language; I can't say what I want, even if I wanted to.""Since when did you start to talk about emotional things?" Namjoon laughs, taking the paper back from Jungkook's clutches. The two watch as he gets up, turning to the girl with a grateful smile on his face."Thank you. I'm less nervous now because of you," He then turns to Jungkook, his smile widening, "And Jungkook."The two blink at the way Namjoon's figure enters the lift, leaving them in the lounge, the chilly air from the air conditioning unit contrasting how hot it was outside."From what I have heard, you'll be going to get dressed and made up in about fifteen minutes." The girl has to say, closing her notebook and turning to look at Jungkook."Yeah. I should go wake Suga-hyung up.""Are you nervous?"For some reason, a big, goofy smile spreads on his face, and [Name] feels attacked at the way his bunny teeth is on display, her heart warming as Jungkook tries to look away, to the coffee table."Of course I'm nervous. It's an award show, after all.""Well, what ever happens won't change the fact that you are a member of Bangtan, and the fact that every army loves you so much. So don't worry.""Did you just quote me?""Yes." The girl takes a cup of coffee near her feet, one Jungkook hadn't even noticed up until then. "Oh, I forgot about this.""Is it an Americano?""Yes. It's gone cold now, though."Jungkook gasps, taking the cup from her grip with a shocked expression on his face. "So you wouldn't drink this?""Yes-""How can you waste coffee? If you aren't drinking this, can I?" Jungkook asks. The girl nods, and watches the way he drinks the entire contents in one go, a satisfied expression on his face after he is done."I won't be seeing you till we get back here after the show, would I?" He questions, getting up to throw the empty cup to the trash. The girl follows, and the two of them enter the lift together to head back upstairs."Well..." [Name] has a big smile on her face as she takes out a small card from her jeans pocket. "I have this."And when he sees that it is a backstage staff pass, Jungkook wants to take every star in the sky and gift it to whoever had given her the chance to do that; in this case, it was probably Bang pd-nim.He decides to keep the star theory for later, excited as the two say 'Ahh!' in unison."Good luck, Jeon Jungkook. Remember, just be yourself, and everything will be fine." [Name] says, giving him a peace sign. Jungkook smiles in response, and he was glad that there weren't people around to see the way he takes a step closer to the girl and wraps both his arms around her."Thank you, [Last Name] [First Name]. I'll see you later."And then he runs into his room; he feels a little embarrassed, and he hopes that [Name] didn't see how red his face his was.And he had completely missed the big, goofy grin that had formed on [Name]'s face.  "I love you, Bangtan!"There is a lot of screaming from all around, many of their fans had come to the awards show, and from the balconies, Jungkook had noticed the many fansite admins and photographers, who flew all the way from Korea, just to take their pictures.He feels thankful, and even though he was a little awkward when the first few pre-show interviews had started, he found that he had eased a little after a while, going so far as deciding it was a good opportunity to take a selca and post it on twitter.He hadn't really doubted the fact that his fans would help get them the award, but Jungkook was filled with mixed emotions when BTS was announced as the best Social artist.It wouldn't have taken more than five minutes, when they had gone up the stage and Namjoon went on with a flawless speech.And yet, the five minutes passed by so fast, similar to way all the happy moments in life pass by quicker than the others.There are dozens of people waiting backstage, waiting for their arrival as they get off from the stage after receiving their award."You won!" Jungkook recognises the girl's voice, speaking in Korean, and that wasn't the only reason why he is able to tell her voice apart from the crowd of people that had started to gather around. Scanning around gets his gaze on the girl who is waving a card holder in the air, flailing her arms in excitement."Yes, we did!" Jungkook responds with a grin, he couldn't go to her yet since there were a lot of post-interviews he had to go to, so all he could do was give her a thumbs up. The girl gives one back in response, and there are multiple flashes going on and off while the boys are taken downstairs for their first interview after the win.After 20 minutes which actually felt like an hour, the boys are finally freed and allowed to go back to their seats. This is when Jungkook snatches the award from Hoseok's hand, and Taehyung is giving a big goofy grin at him when Yoongi follows him out backstage.They had probably talked about Jungkook's plan amonsgt themselves, but he couldn't really be bothered about this fact when he finally sees [Name] leaning against one of the desks where some props had been kept, backstage."[Name]. Over here!" He calls, and the girl turns to face him, beaming when she sees him approaching her. It didn't seem like she noticed Yoongi trailing afterwards, because when Jungkook hurries to take her hand and pull her along with him, she finally sees the older male and her eyes go wide."Jungkookie?! Yoongi-Oppa? What-""Come on." He feels even more nervous than before, one hand gripping the award tightly while the other drags [Name] along with him. Yoongi had found a place backstage where the performers were changing and went to put on makeup, and he is the one that shuts the door when Jungkook enters inside while dragging the girl along with him. She could have sworn that Yoongi was smirking, and she wonders just what on Earth was going on, and if her heart would calm down for crying out loud."Jeon Jungkook, what-""Look. It's our award." There's a pause when he lets go of her hand and faces her, and her eyes go to the award in his hand, glancing at it from up close for the first time."It looks really pretty." [Name] comments, a little startled when Jungkook hands it to her. "Is it okay if I hold it?""Sure. Don't drop it though." He adds in a teasing voice, and the girl punches his arm playfully, after which she wraps her hands around it carefully as she examined the details."You really won, Jungkook. Bangtan always makes me so happy, and so proud. I had to take a break after you guys left the stage, because I was sobbing so hard.""I felt like crying too. A Billboard Award means a lot." Jungkook lets her know, and as he watched the girl hold the Award, he is reminded of the fact that [Name] herself meant just as much to him, if not more."Hey, [Name]...""I'm not sure why you asked me to come here with you, but I'm so nervous that I could die, right now." She interrupts, her eyes not leaving the award, but when Jungkook sees her face dusted pink, he could tell that she was just as nervous as he felt."I feel the same, it has always been that way with you."There's silence between the two, too shy to look at each other, while Jungkook wonders what to say next."I just... I'm terrible at talking about my feelings... But all I know is that I do have feelings... For you." Jungkook internally cringes at how cheesy he sounds, but when he sees [Name] tilting her head up and her eyes going wide, he decides to go on. There was no backing out now."And I have no idea what I would have done if you didn't join BigHit and started working with Suga-hyung. I'd have missed you terribly, and that's not something I want to do.""Jungkook...""I just really... Really like you. And it makes me happy when you smile because of what I said or did. So I want to keep on doing that, if you'll let me.""How can you say things like that with such a straight face?" [Name] questions in disbelief, and this makes Jungkook's face flush. He can feel his ears going redder than earlier, but he had to admit that he liked how he was feeling, and how warm he was feeling, despite the air-conditioning unit that was going on full-blast."I'm going to do something, but don't drop the award." Jungkook warns. [Name] responds with a laugh, what on Earth would he want to do that would cause her to drop something as important as the award?Jungkook wasn't sure if this was the right thing to do, but it sure as hell feels like it, when he cups [Name]'s cheeks, closing his eyes before he leans in and kisses her on the lips.And when he did, he wishes he had listened to Yoongi and done this earlier, because even though his heart was racing like crazy, he liked the way it felt, the way he feels one of [Name]'s arms wrap around his neck as she kisses his back. He could taste the mint of the candy they had just a couple minutes ago.When he feels the award press against his chest, he can't help but burst out laughing, obviously startling the girl as the two take two steps back instantly."Oh my god, the award-""I can feel it poking me."[Name] bursts out laughing as well, and Jungkook doesn't feel so nervous anymore, as he takes a step closer to her and looks at her with a smile."I love you, [Name]. And I know, and I hope that you do too, so I want you to... date me."There's no response from the girl as she blinks at him in shock, and Jungkook wonders if his phrasing sounded a little cocky."...Please.""Why did you add that ten hundred years later?""I'm just nervous, okay?" He ends up blurting out, and [Name] lets out a loud sigh, a hand going to face palm a little."Seriously. A bias wrecker is even worse than an actual bias. You constantly make me feel so conflicted inside.""That actually makes me happy.""You," [Name] says, "Are enjoying this, aren't you?""Yes. Also, you're the one who taught me that a bias and the person you love is different.""You're right. I love you too, Jeon Jungkook."She responds, her hand clutching tightly around the award in her hand. "Can we hug again, but keep this award away? I just might drop it."The words were so simple and yet, he had never felt happier, obliging to the request and putting the award on the desk nearby and facing the girl again with a smile on his face. The two are about to lean in for another hug, when there's a noisy knock from the outside."Jungkook, I'm tired of staying here on guard, now get the fuck out of there!" The two can hear Yoongi's voice yelling, making them startled and take a step back. There are two small grins on their faces when Jungkook takes the lead, [Name] following him out with a slightly embarrassed expression on her face.But even Yoongi is able to tell that everything was okay, from the way the two exchanged smiles, the way they could barely get themselves to take their eyes off from each other.
 
  "Hey, [Name], remember track 56?""Track 56?" The girl looks up from her notebook, and Jungkook, who is seated comfortably beside her on the couch, playing a game, also looks up at his hyung. Yoongi nods, taking his headphones off, his gaze going back to the laptop sitting on his lap."The one I didn't let you listen to."It's four days after the show, back in Korea, and [Name] nods with newfound curiousity. Jungkook blinks at his hyung with a similar, amused expression on his face as he hands the two his earphones. He then proceeds to sit in front of the two, on the coffee table in their dorm."Me too?" Jungkook wants to know, when Yoongi points at him as well. [Name] watches Yoongi nod, an unusually mischievous smile on his face. Wondering what was going on, Jungkook and the girl each put one earbud in, watching Yoongi press a file and click on play."Here's track 56. And whether you say yes or no, this has been finalised as a track for my next mixtape."Pop music begins to play, and the two are bobbing their heads until Yoongi's voice begins to rap.The lyrics make their head whip towards Yoongi, who is looking at them with a big gummy smile on his face."Did you-""Jungkoook and me?!""Well, it took you ten million years to realise your feelings for each other, but you understand that the song is about you two by the first verse? That's unfair as fuck.""Hyung-""Like I said, I've finalised it, so nothing you two say will get me to change it. It's my favourite track in it so far, because I get to indirectly talk about how stupid you two are."There's a couple seconds of silence, while Jungkook and the girl exchange looks."I don't know why hyung is your bias, [Name].""Me neither, Jungkook. Maybe I should downgrade him to my bias wrecker and get you on top, after this.""You little shits-"And just like that, all three of them, Yoongi, [Name], and Jungkook burst out laughing. They all enjoyed each others company, and there was no doubt in the fact that it would continue for a very very long time, if not forever.
the end

31; ｓｅｏｒｅｕｎ-ｈａｎａ[bonus #1]



It's been a couple months since Jungkook and [Name] started dating, and the maknae has to admit that he wasn't able to be as expressive as he wanted to be.He envied Taehyung and Namjoon, who had no troubles with being able to speak exactly what was on their minds. Jungkook had to literally get slapped indirectly in the face multiple times by Yoongi to even get the motivation to confess his feelings.Jungkook's gaze lands on [Name], who is currently seated on Jin's bed, while Yoongi lies on his own, headphones on while he types something on his laptop. They were working on Yoongi's next mixtape, and Jungkook wonders if his hyung would take another three years to be able to complete this one, as well.It's been a while since Jungkook got over his shyness and was able to ask if it was okay if he hung around while Yoongi and [Name] worked together. And Yoongi had responded with a shrug, not really giving much care.Sometimes, when the girl steps outside to get something to drink or to talk to the other members, Yoongi would say something along the lines of "Wow, you're staring at her so much," or "It's disgusting, you're legit drooling." And Jungkook would shake his head in denial, turning himself away because he knew well enough that his face would be burning red.The golden maknae was smitten. 
---
 When his practice finishes at half past 10pm, Jungkook checks his phone for notifications. He is surprised to see that there's a text from [Name], asking him to come down to her dorm, if he could.What surprises him the most was that they had talked during dinner earlier, but she mentioned nothing at all, then. Yet, the thought of being in her presence makes Jungkook soften a little, asking his hyungs if he could have a turn in the shower first. Both Hoseok and Taehyung are exchanging smirks, and Jungkook scurries off before they could ask anything.Upon reaching the floor below his dorm, he sees a few of the stylists who were watching television, all huddled on the couch. Jungkook gives a little smile and nods at them in acknowledgement, before he excuses himself and makes his way towards the door to [Name]'s room. He gives a soft knock, not wanting to wake the others up, and the door opens quietly, which makes him smile because it was proof that [Name] had the same thoughts as he did.Dressed in a loose sweater and shorts, she waves a little, and Jungkook finds himself smiling as he steps inside. He was sure that the stylists were going to tease [Name] later after he left, the same way his group members were cooing and making gooey noises when Jungkook was about to leave their dorm.But it feels worth it, when they simply lean against the bed post, listening to music while seated beside each other. All his life, he's seen people talk about 'lazy days' and how nothing felt like everything. That never made sense to him, until he began to date [Name].Because with her, he could sit and not do anything... But it would still mean more to him than everything else he had, combined."[Name]?""Yes, Jungkook?" She responds, looking up from her tablet. Jungkook pauses, he wonders how to put what he was feeling into words, and he struggles a lot before he is able to finally speak."How long do you think it takes for you to fall in love with someone?"Her response is instantaneous."A day."Jungkook blinks, he isn't sure if he heard her properly, so he simply stares at the way she looks back at him, her gaze unwavering and a small smile curving on her face as she sees his reaction."Are you sure?""Yes."Jungkook feels his heart race a little, and he puts his phone on the coffee table, making his way onto the bed and taking a seat beside her. After a lot of days of [Name] shyly initiating and taking seats beside Jungkook, he finally got over his own shyness of sitting next to the girl he loves."Why do you say that?" Jungkook asks, his eyes going up from the tablet, to her face. From the way [Name]'s face turns a little red, he could easily tell that as much as they had become slowly comfortable with each other, it was still a little embarrassing.Yoongi called it 'young love', and Jungkook couldn't wait for his hyung to fall for someone and become as smitten as he was."Because... Well, different people take different amounts of time, that's for sure, but," She pauses, locking the screen of her handheld device and putting it down. "I feel like it happens slowly... and then all at once.""I feel like I heard that somewhere." Jungkook tries to rake his brain to recall where he heard it from, and [Name] laughs."I think I did, too. What I'm trying to say is, for me, personally... One day, you were my closest friend, and the next... I..."As much as he felt his face burning, Jungkook nods a little, urging the girl to continue."Um. The next, I just... I was so in love with you... Gah, Kookie, why would you make me say that?" She whines, turning away and taking a pillow to cover her face. Jungkook laughs, everyone said he was cute but really, for him, [Name] was the cuter one. He pulls at her pillow, and he doesn't really intend to use so much force... But that was the muscle pig that the girl loved, and she lets out an 'oof!' while she almost loses her balance and falls flat on her face."Geez." There's little chuckling between the two, and after a while, Jungkook feels the need to speak up."I don't think I've ever talked to you about this, but... It was Jimin-hyung and V-hyung that first made me realise how I felt about you. And Yoongi-hyung was the one that got me to express my feelings for you."The surprise on [Name]'s face makes Jungkook laugh so much that his cheeks hurt."Yoongi-oppa? Him, out of all people?!"Jungkook can only laugh in response, because he himself had been shocked about it as well."I remember exactly what Tae-hyung said. He was like 'Jungkookie falls in love, but he has no idea.'" Jungkook laughs a little, watching the way [Name' sits up on the bed, blinking in thought as her eyes focus on his. "I feel stupid thinking that now, because I'm pretty sure I was in love with you way before hyung said that, too... I still don't know exactly when it was, but...""Me neither... All I know is that I knew I liked you more than a friend, back when I heard you talking to Taetae-oppa about... You know.""I'm so sorry, [Name]. I was in denial for ages, I just never considered that I would be someone who would fall in love so easily." Jungkook knew he was supposed to keep a serious face as he apologised, but the girl was smiling so widely as she continued to look at him, so he is flashing his teeth widely as he spoke."I thought you'd date another celebrity," [Name] says, which makes Jungkook purse his lips. "Like... I don't know, IU-sunbaenim', maybe?"Jungkook scoffs, his hands naturally reaching to wrap around the girl while he tackled her down. Their laughs ring throughout the room, while [Name] tries to wriggle away from Jungkook, who continues to tickle her."I look up to IU-sunbaenim. She is very talented and beautiful.""You aren't wrong." [Name] responds, she too was a fan of her as well. She remembers the day when she and Jungkook stayed in all day, listening to music and nibbling on packs, and packs, and more packs of seaweed chips. "Now that I think about it, I'm nothing like the ideal type you described.""What?""I can't cook, and my hair was not long at all, when I first talked to you, back in SOPA." She reads the list, raising a finger for every point she said, "The only subject I'm smart at is language and creative writing, so you can't consider me as smart..." Her eyes grow wide as she looks at Jungkook's face, and stands up on the bed."AND THERE'S NO WAY I'M 168 CENTIMETERS IN HEIGHT." She gasps loudly, being pulled back onto the bed with a plop by Jungkook, who is laughing so hard now that his stomach actually hurts."You said it was an unchanging condition, but I'm-""Oh, [Name]. You'll never change." He chuckles, tucking a lock of hair behind her ear. Really, whenever he talked to her, it always energized him, got him responding more than he would with his band members, and every little thing she said meant so much to him."I'm not at all like your ideal type. So why-""I'm pretty sure I heard you talk about your ideal type being Suga-hyung. Am I like him at all?""Well-""I'm not. It's just that I like you, and you... you like me too, so that's why we are dating." Jungkook flushes a little as he has to say words like that, but when the girl responds with a smile back, he softens a little and smiles back as well."I feel lucky dating you." [Name] says with a smile. Her eyes dart to the clock on the wall, eyes widening as she then runs to the coffee table and takes her sleeping mask. She hands it to Jungkook, who only blinks at her in confusion."What-""Wear it. I have a surprise for you." She says, walking behind him and putting the mask over Jungkook's eyes."What are you even doing-"Jungkook hears the noise of something hitting the bed frame, and he wonders if the girl, clumsy as she is, had bumped into it while she was being frantic. He also hears the noise of crinkling paper and another noise he doesn't really recognize, before he feels the girl climbing back on the bed in front of him.He's about to say something when suddenly-"Happy birthday, Jungkook!" He hears [Name] say loudly, and he takes off the mask, seeing that she is holding a cake in hand, the centre of it decorated with blueberries and his name written in quite messy Hangul. There are two candles lit on one side, and she smiles brightly; And it wasn't the wax of the candles that melted, but it was Jungkook's heart that did."[Name]...""We need to hurry. You'll need to take a bite from this, and then run back to your hyungs. They will kill me if I hoard you for too long." [Name] informs, handing him a plastic knife with a smile. Dumbfounded, Jungkook blinks, taking the knife while his gaze goes to the candles spelling out 21.[Name] is clapping her hands together, and Jungkook can't help the goofy grin spreading on his face while he blows out the candle and sinks the knife into the soft dessert. Cutting out a slice, he takes a bite out of it first, before wide eyes go back to the girl."Wait, I was supposed to feed you the cake first-"[Name] is laughing so hard that she almost drops the cake onto the bed. Shaking her head, she puts the box on the bedspread, taking the knife from his hands and cutting out a larger slice. Her phone gives a buzz, and she glances at it, her eyes going wide as she looks back at Jungkook."You dropped the new cover!"Before [Name] can reach for the slice of cake, Jungkook takes it, and he opens his mouth a little as he holds the slice in front of her face. The girl pauses, putting her phone down before she looks at the slice of cake."The only reason I'm not in a corner right now, listening to the song, is because I've heard you singing it when you were hanging around with me and Yoongi-oppa yesterday." She says, "You thought I had music on, but I didn't.""That makes me regret buying you those headphones, then." Jungkook says, watching the endearing moment of the girl taking a bite out of the cake he's holding up."It's so sweet.""I like blueberry," Jungkook responds, already eating the rest of the slice and licking his fingers at the sweet dessert. His face dusts light pink, as he spoke next. "Thank you for this, really. This is the first time I had a girlfriend celebrate my birthday."[Name] gives him a happy nod, her hands pressing on the mattress as she leans a little closer to Jungkook and kisses his cheek."Happy 21st birthday. Please keep on making millions of people happy... And please continue making me happiest." [Name] says shyly, getting off the bed and tugging on his jacket. Jungkook gets off from the bed, and follows the girl, the two of them going out of the dorm and getting on the lift. Jungkook wasn't sure of how to respond to what the girl had said, so he has his eyes glued onto the cake she is carrying, and the lift gives a loud ding as it stops on Bangtan's dormitory floor.There's loud ruckus while Bangtan is waiting with cakes and decoratives, yelling for their golden maknae finally leaving his teenage days. [Name] scurries from the sides, to the kitchen, where she places the cake she had gotten, inside the fridge. When she comes back out to the living room, the boys have party hats on, and Jungkook is cutting yet another cake, a chocolate one this time.[Name] smiles, feeling really soft at the thought that the fact that there was someone videoing the event meant that they were going to upload it for the armys. She couldn't wait to watch it, when it was out.With the smile intact, she sneaks outside, Jungkook catching a small glimpse of her, and puts the knife down."I... I have something I want to...I need to do. Please edit out the part where I'm gone." Jungkook requests, and he dashes off, out to the door. Namjoon and Seokjin exchange grins, the latter pulling out a ten thousand won bill and handing it to the former. They had clearly made a bet regarding their golden maknae; All while Jimin and Yoongi exchange satisfied smiles.[Name] has stepped into the lift when he reaches her, and Jungkook takes hold of the sleeve of her sweater, pulling her out before he cups both her cheeks and presses his lips against hers.And they both knew that it wasn't just the sweet cakes they'd had earlier, that tasted so sweet, but it was the taste of each other; and there's small smiles forming on their lips as they kissed. Fully oblivious to the members of Bangtan that had sneaked out and were huddled around, spying on them.Really, this was Jungkook's favourite birthday, and it had barely just begun.  
a/n; to the love of my life.

happy birthday. i love who you are, what you try to be, and every shade in between of you trying to achieve your goals. you have my utmost, humble respect. i love you, jungkook, my galaxy. ♥
