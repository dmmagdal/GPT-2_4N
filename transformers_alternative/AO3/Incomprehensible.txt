Chapter Notes
Happy Pride Month everyone! This fic has been up for half a year, wow. No wonder I keep forgetting what I write here haha! (That's your excuse to remind me what you do and don't want to see, because your suggestions are very helpful for getting a new chaper started.) Anyways, I hope y'all like this!



07:54
Sugar Water: EVERYONE I JUST SAW PRESENT MIC WITH A HONEY POT KEYCHAIN
PPAP: JFHANVIER AIZAWA HAS THAT BEE KEYCHAIN WHAT DOES IT MEAN!?!?!?
Gaydar: beep beep
Gaydar: like, I don't actually know anything but it'd be pretty cool if they were together
Gaydar: plus, matching keychains don't happen on accident
~*~No Subtly~*~: Mon ami, stall for me!~ I know what I must do~~
Gaydar: ?? Okay but class stars in two minutes so hurry
PPAP: QUICK what's the stupidest question we can ask to rope Aizawa into a debate
Shrek: why is green such a
Shrek: big color
PPAP: whu 
Shrek: apparently the light wavelength of green is what the human eye is most attuned to
Shrek: it also means that there are more shades of green than there are shades of other colors
Shrek: why green? why does green get to be the big color?
Shrek: and if green’s the big color why is the sky blue?
Shrek: could blue be the big color?
Shrek: where do the lies end?
Weatherman: late night google binge?
Shrek: late night google binge
Shrek: which reminds me
Shrek: Shinso do you have any coffee with you
#1 Cat Lover: -_- b
PPAP: that is perfect debate fodder
Calamari: all i know is that mic is hella bi
Calamari: also a memer
Calamari: two weeks ago he talked about his boyfriend ‘catman sleepypants’ while playing at least thirty remixes of running in the 90s
PPAP: HE HAS A BOYFRIEND
Sticky: catman sleepypants tho…
Sticky: Aizawa sleeps? And I think he likes cats?
Gaydar: seems like we solved a gay mystery
Calamari: the dots were all there, I just didn't think to connect them
Hello Kitty: alright aizawa’s here! Go Deku!
08:09
~*~No Subtly~*~: I’m nearly back amis~~ How’s the stalling going?
Hello Kitty: youre just in time
Hello Kitty: Deku’s almost singlehandedly kept the class locked in a debate about color theory
Hello Kitty: it’s wild we’re going from “is black really the best color for nighttime stealth?” to “how many secret colors are the government keeping from us?”
Hello Kitty: Aizawa hasn’t stopped him yet but there’s only so many times he can loop back to hero costume designs with this crowd
~*~No Subtly~*~: I’ll hurry~~>*!
12:07
Jackass: Alright so we all saw aoyama give Aizawa the pin
Jackass: (nice job btw)
~*~No Subtly~*~: Thank you!~*~*~*
~*~No Subtly~*~: I’ll be off to deliver Mic’s now!~~~~
Jackass: and we know he said it was too flashy for his costume
Jackass: but was I the only one who thought he put it on under his scarf?
Kerropi: no I definitely saw that
Jackass: lesbian frog queen has spoken and her word is truth, case closed
Kerropi: while we’re solving mysteries, where’s Iida?
Shrek: ah he’s sick today so he's up in his room sleeping
Shrek: Shoto and I are bringing him lunch
Kerropi: I see, I hope he feels better soon
Jackass: we really need to change Midoriyas name though I nearly died of shock
Kahoot: Oh! I've got one! I will handle it babe.
Jackass: damn nearly had a heart attack there these people really out to kill me today
Jackass: love you babe <3
Kahoot has changed Shrek’s name to Small Might
Weatherman: hi would you like to see my presentation on why all might is his father
Small Might: Shoto we've been over this! He's not my dad!
Kahoot: I love you too Kyoka! <3 And please try not to go into cardiac arrest.
Kahoot: Shoto, what evidence do you have that All Might is Izuku’s father?
Small Might: nooooooooooo
Small Might: brb need some of Shinso’s coffee to deal with this
Weatherman: you cant leave were feeding our boyfriend
Small Might: he’s still sleeping and i’ll go get him an icepack
Weatherman: he doesnt need an icepack
Small Might: he MIGHT need an icepack later so i’m being responsible
Small Might: …pun unintended
Weatherman: reason 1 why izuku is all mights kid: same quirk
Small Might: okay at shinso’s room gonna drink coffee for long enough to not have to watch this conversation bye
Kahoot: That is a good point.
Weatherman: reason 2: same hair floof
Weatherman: his moms hair is straighter than anyone in this class, it had to come from somewhere
Kahoot: Isn’t All Might’s hair more of a mane compared to Izuku’s curls, though?
Weatherman: semantics
Weatherman: reason 3: I think they knew each other before school started
Hello Kitty: can confirm all might borrowed Deku for lunch one day back in first semester
Small Might: sgrmfhsrg,hf.mb I can't believe you remember that
Small Might: betrayal on all sides
Weatherman: it's not betrayal if it's the truth
Small Might: my dad breathed fire! All might doesn't breathe fire!
Weatherman: or does he?
Kahoot: If we are to follow this line of thinking, wouldn’t it be logical to assume he may have lied about his quirk? If he never showed your mother his fire breath, there is no proof he truly could.
Kahoot: Any photos, videos, or quirk registry papers could have been forged. And even an in-person demonstration could have been falsified with the right tools and techniques.
Kahoot: Shoto, this theory is proving to be quite plausible, not to mention exciting! Let’s talk about this in person.
Small Might: a
Small Might: oh no im starting to believe this
Small Might: I'll be fine Shinso has a mug the size of my head
#1 Cat Lover: Mocha and I will supervise him
Weatherman: thank you for enabling both of us
15:48
10 Speed: I Have Returned!
10 Speed: What have I missed?
Hello Kitty: okay so prez mix and Aizawa have matching keychains
Hello Kitty: Aoyama did their thing and made them each a pin
Hello Kitty: Jiro nearly died
Hello Kitty: Deku drank too much coffee and is apparently possibly all might’s kid
10 Speed: …I meant school work?
Hello Kitty: oh we just ended up debating color theory all day
Hello Kitty: it wasn't even a serious debate you're fine
Hello Kitty: you shouldve seen it tho deku had the whole class ready to start a coup over the forbidden colors
Tinkerer: I’m only hearing about this in the past tense and even I’M ready to start a coup
10 Speed: please don’t
10 Speed: What, dare I ask, spurred him to lead the discussion in that direction?
Hello Kitty: oh after we found out about the keychains Aoyama asked us to stall for them to make the pins
10 Speed: I am glad it was at least for a reasonable cause
10 Speed: You know, I think my brother has a flower keychain similar in design to theirs!
10 Speed: What a coincidence!
Tinkerer: That sounds like no coincidence to me!
Tinkerer: My friend, add your brother to this chat immediatly!
Tinkerer: WE! NEED! ANSWERS!
10 Speed has added Sanic to Class 1-Ass
Sanic: first off you guys should really change that name
Calamari: I COULDNT THINK OF ANYTHING BETTER AT THE TIME
Sanic: second off, what’s the sitch?
Tinkerer: Why do you, Aizawa, and Present Mic have matching keychains?
Small Might: I can't believe THE ingenium has been here for less than a minute and already referenced two memes
10 Speed: oh
10 Speed: bleieve it
10 Speed: I thought we’ve been over thsi already
Small Might: TENYA’S TYPOING AND HIS BROTHER’S MEMEING WHAT HAS THE WORLD COME TO 
Weatherman: calm down
Sanic: who's tinkerer I can't guess who it is from the name
Tinkerer: Call me Hatsume Mei!
Sanic: Oh you're the one who used Tenya to stage an infomercial for yourself!
Sanic: good work.
Tinkerer: Thank you sir!
Tinkerer: Now could you answer the question?
Sanic: oh yea
Sanic: we have flower-bee-honey keychains cus were all dating
10 Speed: AND YOU DIDNT TELL ME!?
10 Speed: I told you when I started dating Izuku and Shoto!
Sanic: bb.. BUT YOU DIDNT?!?!
Weatherman: and one of them is all mights son
Small Might: THATS IT TICKLE FIGHT 
Sanic: Wow… I’m so proud you found some great partners
Sanic: so is it an Iida thing to date two people now?
10 Speed: I suppose!
Tinkerer: TWO OF YOUR TEACHERS ARE YOUR UNCLES!
10 Speed: I think it’s time to go back to sleep.

Spooning (It's not what you think it is)
Chapter Notes
I've developed a standard recipe for these:25-30% stuff I wrote like five months ago25-30% stuff I wrote two weeks ago40-50% stuff I wrote when I decided 'okay I should post a chapter today'



07:42Sugar water: who decided spooning was okay?Sugar water: I live every day in fear
Sanic: uh isnt spooning cuddling?
Sugar water: no not that kind of spooningSugar water: it's where you sneak plastic spoons into people’s water bottles, in their hoods, pockets, etc
Sanic: ah sounds fun
Sugar water: its not! Sugar water: I was walking to lunch with Uraraka yesterday and I turned to her and said “I hope no one spoons me”Sugar water: but when I turn she's right there trying to put a spoon in my pocket!
Calamari: the amount of times I find a spoon in my hoodie has seriously made me consider not wearing itCalamari: and it's my favorite hoodie!
Sanic: isnt it like… summer tho
Calamari: favorite hoodieCalamari: it has pikachu
Sanic: ah completely understandable
Kahoot: I had to make a water bottle with a wider top so I do not have to dump my water out every time a spoon appears in it!
Man car door hook hand: I keep finding them in my belt loops. Who does that.
Sanic: oh my god this is amazingSanic: I havent seen this much chaos since i was a student
Kahoot: What’s worse is that it has become a competition, and we’re not sure who all the participants are.
Hello Kitty: I'll fess up I'm one of themHello Kitty: Bakugo and Deku are too, and I think Hatsume?
Small Might: Uraraka’s really good at this game I tried to get her and she caught me immediatly
Hello Kitty: yaint slick
Calamari: oh my god that was you? you were yelling in the cafeteria?Calamari: you used yaint?
Hello Kitty: only because it's true, Deku aint slick
Small Might: uh check again
Hello Kitty: FUCK

Sticky: Farewell my sweet! I hope by then I will still recognize your face!
The rocket that killed Jaws: stop talking like a cheesy romance novel you'll see each other at lunch
Birb: we’re just splitting up to observe the other departments, no need to get Emo
PPAP: says youPPAP: what happened to your memes anyways?
Calamari: memes are cool but sometimes you just gotta whip out the Classy EnglishCalamari: watch thisCalamari: Hanta! My heart yearns for when we can once more embrace, for the day that heaven above grants me the privilege of your lips! I long for every inch of you, yet I think in all your overwhelming beauty I would be sated to simply take your fingers in my grasp!
Sticky: this is aizawaSticky: stop
Calamari: would you stand in the way of young love?!
Sticky: only when it results in someone almost breaking their nose
PPAP: at least do it on your own phone!
Eraser: stop texting and walking it's recovery girl’s day off
Tinkerer: SHINSO GET OVER HERE I NEED YOUR SPIT
#1 Cat Parent: … Why?
Tinkerer: DNA test! I couldn't stand it if we were sibs from different cribs and didn't know!
#1 Cat Parent has changed Tinkerer’s name to Chaos
#1 Cat Parent: ok
Chaos: Yay!
Eraser: and this is why I'm taking the business course group
12:08Hello Kitty: those business students don't appreciate my spoonsHello Kitty: I even put stickers on them
#1 Cat Parent: you would've loved the support students#1 Cat Parent: everyone was spooning everything
Sticky: the buissiness course had this really weird video they playedSticky: I still don't get what it was trying to explain??
Calamari: what was it like??
Sticky: two 3D animated animals. possibly bearsSticky: voice by google translate and siriSticky: bear 1: *jargon referring to a ridiculous concept phrased as a question*Sticky: bear 2: yes

#1 Cat Parent: I think prolonged exposure to hatsume just increases your chaos#1 Cat Parent: and you'll see what she did when you leave your dorm
Gaydar: ohGaydar: how did she even do this?
#1 Cat Parent: I'm assuming a 3D printer was involved
Gaydar: damnGaydar: she probably built it herself tooGaydar: well I'm gonna eat breakfast and leave the others to find this
#1 Cat Parent: I'm making a pot of coffee want some?
Gaydar: normal coffee?
#1 Cat Parent: as opposed to what? decaf?
Gaydar: no I just thought you had a secret coffee recipe sorry dude
#1 Cat Parent: no worries
08:35The big tail: so shinso’s sitting on the common room couchThe big tail: a giant pink spoon next to himThe big tail: he’s calmly sitting there, sipping coffee, and other giant pink spoons are scattered about the roomThe big tail: and Mocha is sitting in his lap as he strokes herThe big tail: this is not a hallucination?? And is it weird it's a little hot??
Gaydar: nope no hallucinations hereGaydar: and are you sure you don't just find Shinso a little hot all the time?
The big tail: The big tail: oh
Gaydar: beep beep my friend
#1 Cat Parent: hey guess who has a phone and can read?#1 Cat Parent: Ojiro, wanna swing by a cat cafe and leave the spoons for someone else to clean up?
The big tail: uh sure
#1 Cat Parent: great it's a date
