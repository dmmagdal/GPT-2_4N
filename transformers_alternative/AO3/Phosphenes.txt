Phosphenes
by CynoDemure
Summary
Namjoon's life turned tough when we was sixteen and made one little mistake.He lives many lives after that, always finding what he was missing.
Notes
This is gonna be set up a little differently, and I hope it makes sense how I’m gonna explain it.The first chapter is a constant.All following chapters will be their own follow-up to the first chapter, titled after the member involved and paired with Namjoon. None of the chapters have anything to do with each other.The last chapter will be a little different, but we’ll get to that when we get to it.Basically, as you read each chapter, forget what happened in every previous chapter/s except the first one.Hope that’s understandable and, if not, hopefully you’ll get the gist as it goes on!There are also a few connections between the chapters just for like. My own enjoyment. And each one has a word or a couple of words that crop up a lot.Some of the chapters are a little dirtier than others so be prepared for that.And the ages of Namjoon and whoever he is paired with are constant, but other ages changes based on my whims.I don’t know.I had fun writing this.Anyway.I’ve always been bad with tense shifting. Like. Ever since I was knee-high to a grasshopper, man. Sorry in advance! It’ll jump around a lot and it’s just kind of. I try to fix it and it messes everything up even more.Enjoy!

          See the end of the work for more notes





The Constant



Namjoon was a good man. Perhaps not a great man, but a good one. And that was all that really mattered, right? He tried to do the right thing and he tried to be okay and tried to be kind and tried to be a lot of things. Just because he didn’t always succeed didn’t mean he was terrible. Sometimes, making a valiant effort was better than not bothering at all.
So why was it, exactly, that Namjoon was being fired from his job?
Again?
He didn’t do anything wrong, per say. At least, he didn’t think he did.

---

If you had told Namjoon six years ago that he’d be living on his own with no parental assistance, he wouldn’t have believed you.
If you had told Namjoon six year ago that he’d be struggling to make rent while, at the same time, struggling to feed himself, he wouldn't have believed you.
If you had told Namjoon six years ago that he would be the owner of a laundry list of jobs he’d failed at doing and was rightfully fired from, he wouldn’t have believed you.
But Namjoon from six years ago was a lot of things that Namjoon six years now was not.
A lot can happen in six years. And, sometimes, a lot more than six years worth of happenings can occur in that span of time.

---

It was cold in his apartment. This wasn’t a surprise. Heating the room took a lot more money than he could really afford.
Buying sweaters and gloves and hats and socks was a better investment. They were able to be worn outside. Heating the inside of a one room apartment did nothing for him when he was out and about other than leach money he didn’t have.
Once, he’d woken up to find the bottle of water he kept by his blanket pile frozen almost solid.
Namjoon layered on another sweater and pair of socks and went back to sleep.

---

When Namjoon was sixteen, he’d thought he had the best parents in the whole world.
When Namjoon was sixteen, his parents thought they had the best son in the whole world.
When Namjoon was sixteen, he thought he could tell his parents anything.
When Namjoon was sixteen, his parents were proud of him.
When Namjoon was sixteen, his parents bragged often about his intelligence, his kindness, his Namjoonness.
When Namjoon was sixteen, he realized that, maybe (just maybe) he liked boys more than girls.
When Namjoon was sixteen, he told his parents that, maybe (just maybe) he liked boys more than girls.
When Namjoon was sixteen, his parents shoved a duffel bag into his hands, all the cash they had in their wallets, and told him not to come back.

---

When Namjoon was sixteen, he didn’t come back.

---

When Namjoon was sixteen, he stopped going to school. He needed to find job. That was more important.
He was smart enough to reason that out.
He could go back later, if he got the chance.

---

When Namjoon was sixteen, he managed to get himself to the middle of Seoul. He managed to get a job working the register part time at a convenience store. He managed to get a small, one room apartment with a bathroom and a two burner stove. A little oven and a half fridge. It came with water and garbage included, but he’d have to pay for electricity and heat on his own.
It wasn’t so bad, admittedly. He’d survived a harsh winter on the streets. (His first winter alone.) (The first of many to come.)
This apartment (however small and ill kept) was a utopia.

---

When Namjoon was almost seventeen, he was fired from the barista job he’d taken after being fired from the convenience store. He’d spilled one-too-many pitchers of steamed milk. Squirted one-too-many coworkers with sticky flavored syrup. Taken one-too-many free bites of food he was supposed to purchase.
Food was hard to come by sometimes.
So he’d learned to eat when he got hungry and there was food around.

---

Namjoon was almost evicted that first winter in his apartment.
He’d turned the heat on for one night.
The rent had shot up.
The next paycheck he got from the gas station went to paying for the extra electric.
The next paycheck he got from the receptionists position he took (after the gas station) went to buying few extra layers of clothes so that wouldn’t happen again.

---

That first Christmas in the apartment, Namjoon found himself wandering the streets. Walking was easier than sitting around doing nothing, and with everyone enjoying the time with their family and loved ones, the streets were empty.
But the library was open.
And the library was free.

---

If nothing else, Namjoon knew how to read. And he was very good at it.

---

Namjoon found that sitting in a free library during the winter was a smart decision. He wouldn’t be thinking about how cold his apartment was because he wasn’t there.
Because the library had heat.
Because the library was full of books.
Because books were a wonderful distraction from real life.

---

While Namjoon couldn’t afford food most days, he certainly devoured more books than the average person. He’d sit in the corner of the library for hours, turning page after page, savoring the words on each line.
Weighing the taste of letters on his tongue.
Swallowing back knowledge like a drunkard does wine.

---

When Namjoon was eighteen, he’d taught himself English from books in the warm, free library.
The women who worked there knew him well. Would sometimes offer him snacks that he would never refuse. Would comment on how skinny he looked. How his parents needed to feed him more.
He’d drink away his hunger from the water fountain and fill a disposable plastic bottle before he left.
He’d bask in the heated air that blew from the vent above the table he chose each day.
When Namjoon wasn’t working or sleeping or struggling to make all his ends meet somewhere somehow, he was in the library.
He was growing fatty and plump on knowledge.

---

When Namjoon was eighteen, he lied his way into a job at a garage. He’d read all about it. Knew what a carburetor was. Knew the steps it took to change the oil to change a belt to change a tire.
He knew, but he’d never done.
The job lasted two weeks.
He had a pair of jeans ruined by grease.

---

When Namjoon was eighteen, he worked at a dry cleaners. Customers clothes were often returned to them with more stains than they had been dropped off with. When questioned, Namjoon insisted he didn’t know a thing about it.

---

The barbershop.
The deli.
The cafe.
The second automotive repair.
Florist.
Coffeeshop.
Dentist’s Office Reception Desk.
Computer Telecommunication Repair.

---

It’s easy to learn by reading, but putting written word into practice is harder than it seems.

---

Namjoon turned twenty in the library. He read a book on cake decorating.

---

When Namjoon was twenty, he almost lost his apartment again. He promised to pay two month's rent the next week and managed it only because he’d stolen a tourist's wallet after watching them enter their pin into the machine at his register.
He wasn’t dumb enough to get caught on camera anywhere.
And now he had a nice sum of won tucked away Just In Case.

---

He used it up quickly, but he was just so hungry, sometimes it was hard to not eat.
Especially working at a bakery a coffee shop a bistro.
Especially working as a busboy a waiter a dishwasher.

---

Namjoon turned twenty-one in the library. He read the same book on cake decorating.

---

Namjoon turned twenty-two in the library. He read the same book on cake decorating. He figured it was as close to a tradition as he was going to get.

---

When Namjoon was twenty-two, he was fired from his most recent job.

---

Namjoon was a good man. Perhaps not a great man, but a good one. And that was all that really mattered, right? He tried to do the right thing and he tried to be okay and tried to be kind and tried to be a lot of things. Just because he didn’t always succeed didn’t mean he was terrible. Sometimes, making a valiant effort was better than not bothering at all.

---

And Namjoon, like always, applied for another job.



Seokjin
Chapter Notes
I wrote all the chapters in their proper order and most of them start to finish. Only two of them were written jumping back and forth as I came up with future events that I didn't want to forget.This is not one of those chapters, hahaha

        See the end of the chapter for more notes




This wasn't the first bakery Namjoon worked in (he was pretty sure it wouldn't be the last). But it was the first that allowed the staff to take home the throw aways. The food that, after one day on the shelf, had to be tossed in the trash or given away for free.
Seokjin, the owner and baker, let the staff have first pick. When he left at lunchtime, he took everything that hadn't sold the day before and the staff hadn't sequestered away for themselves to a local food pantry to be panned out to the needy public.
(It served two purposes; he helped out the city and he paid less in trash bills. A real win-win.)
When Namjoon started working, there was suddenly much less food to take. 
---
Seokjin hired Namjoon because he had previous experience in a bakery as well as working a register. He seemed like a nice enough guy, and the reference he called (an old woman from the library Namjoon called his grandmother on the paper application ) declared him smart and overly capable. A little quiet and secretive, but he'd open up if given the time.
(They all thought he'd opened up to them, but that was not so much the case. He told them what they'd wanted to hear, and that was that.)
But Namjoon had an impressive vocabulary as far as baking was concerned, and if Seokjin didn't know better from the sheer uncomfortable air Namjoon displayed when brought back into the kitchens on the quick tour of the shop, he'd have taken the younger for a Master in the field.
Whatever the case, Namjoon started work and, on the first night, Seokjin had never seen anyone eat so many sweets. 
---
Namjoon, in fact, should not have eaten as much as he did. It was just that the prospect had been too good to pass up. To think--just yesterday, he'd finished up the last row of crackers in the box he'd bought a week ago, and today--
Today, he got to eat three slices of pie, four cookies, two cupcakes, three chocolate covered strawberries, and a plate full of crumb cake.
He was in paradise.
Until he turned green in the gills and pushed past Seokjin to the small unisex bathroom to throw up.
There was a glass of water and a pair of breath mints waiting for him when he finally convinced his stomach to settle and stop lurching.
His mouth tasted like bile well into the next morning. 
---
Seokjin didn't question the behavior. He was young, not stupid.
Namjoon was skinny. His clothes were a little more than threadbare. He had disheveled hair that appeared to have been cut using rusty kitchen scissors. His eyes had a full set of luggage, suit carrier included, rather than simple bags.
Seokjin could see there was a struggle, but it wasn't really his place to question it. 
---
After that first day, Namjoon settled down. He'd take two boxes of throw aways home and snack on a few things before he left.
All other employees took, at most, one box of goodies. And Seokjin knew the employees well.
It was a tiny bakery after all. Just him and four others, Namjoon included. Seokjin prided himself on knowing who his employees actually were and not just by what they could do for him on the job.
(Like Hoseok, for example. Who had saved up and flown himself and his partner, Yoongi, to America to become husband's, even if the paper would hold no meaning in Korea.)
(Like Yoongi, who, with his husband, Hoseok, had finally managed to adopt children--two of them!--who would sometimes come to the bakery with their Papa and Daddy when the baby sitter couldn't take them. Even if Taehyung and Jimin were little terrors who stuck their fingers into icing and broke eggs on the floor and flung powdered sugar at each other like they were paid to do it.)
(But they were small and they were cute and they always apologized. It was hard to refuse that boxy grin or those chubby cheeks.)
(And like Jungkook who, bless his heart, didn't care one bit about baking. He was working part time to pay for photography classes his parents agreed to sign him up for, given the condition that he pay for them himself.)
Seokjin tried to pay attention to all of them. He knew them well enough to tell by the set of their shoulders or jaw alone who he needed to remove from register Right Now, lest he have an unhappy customer or two. 
---
Namjoon was a wildcard, though.
He didn't talk much about home. Didn't give much away. He seemed to bathe frequently at the very least, and his clothes were washed, which was the least amount of sanitary Seokjin needed him to be.
Namjoon always arrived by foot, despite the city bus and subway stop right outside the bakery (a happy coincidence that kept Seokjin in business due to the steady flow of people getting on and coming off), so he must have lived close. Why else would he walk? 
---
Namjoon lived a good five city clocks away. Not the largest distance, but pretty inconvenient, to say the least. (Especially in the winter.) Busses and subways and taxis were luxuries he couldn't afford when he had two perfectly good feet.
Perhaps not two good shoes, but feet for sure. 
---
Winter came and winter went. Seokjin didn't know why Namjoon didn't ask his parents for a new coat for Christmas. The one he always showed up in was on its last leg.
---
When winter broke, Seokjin worried. Namjoon seemed ill, but still, he came to work. Eyes red, nose running, cheeks flushed with heat one second or pale and flat the next. He took frequent trips to the bathroom to splash water at his face and clean off a sheen of sweat that gathered at his brow.
After the fifth trip, Seokjin pulled him aside.
“You don't have to be here right now, Namjoon.  You look sicker than a dog. Perhaps go home, heat up some chicken soup, and lay down. I guarantee you'll feel better tomorrow. “
But the younger shook his head. “No… no, I'm fine Seokjin-ssi. Don't worry about me. It 's just a bit of a cold. Nothing to worry about--I get them this time of year all the time.”
Seokjin furrowed his brows. “I'm sorry, Namjoon, but I'm really going to have to ask you to go home. I can't have someone working with food if they're ill. Jungkook comes in in an hour, and I can handle myself until then. Go home. Eat soup. Don't come back until you feel--”
“Please, Seokjin-ssi. I really need to work,” quiet. Desperate. Seokjin frowned. “I… my rent is due this week and…” Namjoon trailed off, shifting uneasily and reaching up to rub his thin sweaters sleeve across his forehead, removing a layer of sweat. His cheeks were pale and dull.
“You've never gotten sent home, so you wouldn't know,” Seokjin starts, even if he doesn't know why, “But if I send you home for a reason that's got nothing to do with your attitude, you still get the full times pay.”
They don't. Seokjin has never done that. It's not a good business policy.
But he's fair and nice and his workers love him.
But he doesn't pay them when they don't work.
Namjoon looks relieved, though. He breathes out heavily, but turns his head when the action forces a cough to bubble up. So his mouth gets buried in the crook of his elbow and he stays like that until he can catch his breath.
“Thank you, Seokjin-ssi. I'll be on time tomorrow, I promise.”
Namjoon stops at the restroom once more to clean his face, then pulls his coat on and heads out.
He goes to the library for the heat. For the water. For the light snacks he'll choke down.
He'd still taken two boxes of sweets.
But he'll throw up all the snacks and water before he makes it back to his apartment for the night. 
---
Namjoon comes into work the next day. Seokjin sends him home immediately. Reminds him to eat soup. To sleep. To drink lots of water.
Namjoon goes to the library.
Not for the first time, he falls asleep over a book.
The librarian women let him rest.
---
Namjoon looks good enough to stay at work the next day, and Seokjin is content with that thought. The younger still looks ill, but there’s little fear of him passing out now, it seems.
So Seokjin lets him stay.
Namjoon gets to bring a stool behind the counter to rest on when he feels light headed, but that’s the only extra help he’s given for the time being.
---
It’s another few months before Seokjin decides to actually ask Namjoon why he takes home so many sweets. But he’s young, not stupid.
So he asks in the most nonthreatening way he can think.
“So, Namjoon,” a pause. He sprays a little more cleaner on the outside of the glass display window on the counter. “There must be lots of mouths to feed with how many sweets you take home every day,” Seokjin chuckles, hoping to show no malice in the statement.
But Namjoon tenses up anyway, fingers stilling over the change he’s counting. Seokjin frowns slightly.
“I, uh. Not really, no. It’s just me,” Namjoon’s tongue peeks out to swipe nervously over his lips.
“Oh? Please tell me you don’t eat them all in one night!” there’s a laugh. Seokjin knows he doesn’t. Namjoon can’t be eating two full boxes of sweets every day and still be as skinny as he is.
“I,” a shift. “No, I space it out. It lasts a couple of days if I do the math right,” mumbling lightly. “Sometimes I give a box to my landlord in exchange for a bit of leeway on my rent.” Namjoon shrugs.
“Oh,” Seokjin stands, watching Namjoon critically. The younger keeps his eyes on the coins in front of him.
The silence drags.
Seokjin wants to say something else.
The silence keeps dragging.
---
“Is everything alright at home, Namjoon?”
Seokjin’s only response is a tight, quick nod.
---
“This is the longest I’ve kept a job, Seokjin-ssi” Namjoon confides, two weeks before he turns twenty-three. Seokjin had weaseled out his birthday a month earlier, but right now, they’re working to plan Jungkook’s cake.
“Please, call me hyung,” a small shift, “And I’m glad I’ve done that for you, Namjoon-ah. I hope that you’re happy here.”
Namjoon’s quiet for a long while, but he eventually responds. “Yeah. I think I am, Seokjin-hyung. The happiest I’ve been in a long time, I think.”
Seokjin could say the same thing.
He doesn’t.
But he could.
---
Namjoon turns twenty-three in the bakery, surrounded by his coworkers. He forgets about his cake decorating book and, instead, places a forkful of chocolate and peanut butter cake onto his tongue.
It tastes just like all the other things Seokjin’s made.
It tastes like paradise.
---
“I made it with love,” Seokjin informs him, after the others have left and it’s just the birthday boy and baker alone together in the shop. The store still needs cleaning and everyone else had other things to tend to. (Jungkook had class the next morning, and the parents needed to get their wildfire children into bed before they caught their second wind.)
“Love?” Namjoon inquires, glancing at his boss from the lobby where he’s turning chairs upside down onto tables. The floor needs a good sweep and mop and the chairs would just be in the way. “Is...that why all of your stuff tastes so good?”
Seokjin laughs. “I don’t make everything with love, Namjoon. Just the things I make for those special to me. I wouldn’t have any love left if I made everything that way.”
He swears Namjoon’s cheeks turn pink, but the younger looks away too fast for him to be sure.
---
Winter sets in early that year. The first snow falls four days past Jimin’s seventh birthday.
The streets grow cold.
Namjoon’s apartment grows cold.
Namjoon grows cold.
Namjoon grows ill.
---
“Is everything okay at home, Namjoon-ah?”
This time, there’s no nod. Instead, Namjoon quiets. He stops sweeping up the mess of flour (that Taehyung had created when he was reminded (once again) that, no, he was not older than Jimin) and watches the way it settles against the linoleum. He sniffs, but Seokjin doesn’t look over. Namjoon has been nursing a cold for the past week and sniffling was nothing new.
“No,” it’s soft. Seokjin almost doesn’t catch it, and if he hadn’t been listening so intently, he might not have. “No, it’s not, Hyung,” Namjoon looks up and over.
Seokjin’s staring his way now.
Namjoon swallows.
His eyes are a little red and Seokjin knows what’s coming, so he reacts before it can happen.
---
Namjoon hasn’t been held in a long time. But Seokjin is warm and Namjoon is cold. Seokjin smells like butter and milk and happiness. Namjoon smells of cheap shampoo and sickness.
Seokjin holds him tighter when Namjoon stiffens to the touch. Grips the back of Namjoon’s thin, loose sweater with one hand and presses the other against the back of Namjoon‘s head, fingers scratching lightly through greasy hair. He cradles the younger’s face against his neck.
Namjoon cries.
For what feels like the first time since he was sixteen, he cries.
---
Nothing happens after that. Not for a few more months.
It’s spring and the world is bright and new.
Neither man mentions the incident.
Seokjin doesn't ask and Namjoon doesn't offer any information past what has already been said. There's not much to go by, but Seokjin isn't going to pry when it seems to make Namjoon uncomfortable. So, instead, he just makes sure Namjoon at least eats something when he's there.
More than once, Seokjin has ‘not been as hungry as he thought he would be’ and relinquished half of his lunch or dinner to the younger.
Namjoon either didn't catch on or he didn't care because he always ate the food without a second thought. 
---
Namjoon knew from the first time Seokjin did it. How could he not? But it was free food and it was not a dessert, so he wasn't going to pass the opportunity up.
He ate anything and everything Seokjin brought him. Played it up, of course--‘are you sure you're not going to want this?’ ‘It looks like you were really enjoying it...are you sure I can have it?’--but in the end, he still ate the food. 
---
A month of taking ‘leftover’ lunches and Seokjin just brought along a second Tupperware with him.
Namjoon excused himself to the bathroom when Seokjin pulled them both out and settled the containers on the small table in the back of the kitchen.
He cried for a solid two minutes before working to calm himself down. When he came back out, it was clear what had happened, but, even so, Seokjin didn't mention it. Just passed Namjoon the chopsticks and sat down, pressing their thighs together softly before starting to eat.
Namjoon didn’t move away.
---
Seokjin continued to bring a second lunch with him. Put the containers in the fridge and ate with Namjoon when the time came. Namjoon didn't question it.
Seokjin noticed he'd started taking one box of sweets home.
Namjoon didn't put on any visible weight, of course. One solid meal a day, plus snacking on sweets can't work miracles in that way. But Namjoon certainly seemed better. He seemed happier. Livelier. A little less tired all the time.
Seokjin was happy to see it. 
---
The bakery was closed to celebrate Chuseok each year. Seokjin asked what Namjoon planned to do in celebration. Perhaps return to his home to visit a family that certainly misses him?
It was not the right question to ask.
Namjoon shut down. He’d been smiling before. Laughing, even, at something Hoseok had said. (Hadn’t he been telling a story about the kids? Something about a dog? Seokjin had only been half paying attention. The other half was hyper focused on the dimples he’d never noticed on Namjoon’s cheeks.)
But now--
Now Namjoon’s eyes were on the ground. His hands clutched tighter at the handle of the broom he held. He shifted his weight from foot to foot and, after a long stretch of quiet, he shrugged. Mumbled something incomprehensible and then moved away and to the back of the store, ducking through the door to work on sweeping the floor there.
Seokjin pursed his lips and gave him a few minutes alone before following him through the door.
“Namjoon-ah?” a swallow, “Namjoon-ah, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to...make you feel the way you’re feeling.”
Namjoon shrugged again, dragging the broom over what he thought was a piece of dirt, but was actually just a stain on the floor. He kept trying, if only to give himself something to do.
“You don’t have to answer, but,” a pause. Seokjin wet his lips. “Is everything okay at home, Namjoon-ah?”
---
Namjoon curled up in the corner of the kitchen and cried. Seokjin left only once, to ask Hoseok to stay a little longer, if he could, please. And then he was back, settling in next to Namjoon, hands pulling on the younger until he was curled in his lap instead.
One hand fisted in Namjoon’s thin, loose sweater and the other threaded into greasy hair.
“It’s going to be okay,” Seokjin started, shushing lightly. The hand on Namjoon’s head moved carefully, petting through the black hair, as gentle as he could manage. “I’m here for you, Namjoon-ah. Even if no one else is, I’m here for you. You don’t have to worry about that. I’m not going anywhere.”
---
Before the end of the hour, Namjoon had calmed considerably and, despite the cramping in his long limbs, he stayed curled in Seokjin’s lap. His face pressed into his elder’s neck, breathing slow and steady.
Breathing in butter and milk and happiness.
Seokjin could only smell cheap shampoo and sickness.
---
“Come with me, Namjoonie. To Anyang. My family won’t mind. Mom always makes too much food anyway.”
There’s no response.
---
“I’ve been telling my mother about you, you know? I tell her about all my employees, of course. She’s met everyone else and is very interested in meeting you as well,” a pause. “I’m driving to Anyang and I promise I’m a great driver.”
Namjoon pointedly doesn’t look at Seokjin.
---
“I’m leaving tomorrow at noon. I’m baking everything that needs to be sold for the day and giving the keys to Yoongi-chii to lock up. You’re still more than welcome to come.”
---
Seokjin’s only a little confused when Namjoon turns up at the bakery the next morning at 11:30.
“You don't work today, Joonie,” head tilting to one side. He can’t help but notice the old and ratty duffel bag slung over Namjoon’s shoulder.
“I...was wondering if I could still...you know,” Namjoon looks away. “If I could come with you. To Anyang. For Chuseok.” His weight shifts and he’s not meeting Seokjin’s face.
But Seokjin smiles.
“Of course, Joonie. Let me just text my mom to let her know you’ll be coming with me--she already planned on you being there, so it’s nothing to worry about,” a pause. “Do you have everything you’ll need? We’ll be there for four days.”
He’s worried, of course. Namjoon doesn’t have many clothes. He rotates through the same sets every week, but can’t seem to remember if Namjoon owns more than four shirts.
“I...yeah,” the younger shifts, wetting his lips and subconsciously touching at the duffel bag. “Are you sure that it’s okay that I come? I won’t be a bother?”
“Of course not!” Seokjin smiles. “I was just about done here, as it goes. So let me just toss my apron in the bin and give Yoongi the keys, and we can head out a little early.” He heads to the door to the kitchen, passing through it before poking his head back out. “Have you eaten lunch yet?” he knows the answer.
Namjoon glances off and shakes his head.
“Good. Fast food burgers, fries, and shakes on me. It’s my traditional Driving Home for Chuseok meal.”
Namjoon looks back, raising a brow. “Anyang isn’t that far from here, though.”
Seokjin disappears back behind the door, but Yoongi and Namjoon still catch his response.
“Yeah, but traffic is horrible!”
---
The days Namjoon spent with Seokjin’s family were the best he’s had in a long while. The best since his first Christmas in the library.
It's certainly strange though. Seokjin’s family is just so accepting. Both his mother and father, on separate occasions, ask how Hoseok and Yoongi were doing. Inquired about the boys.
Seokjin was forced to show photos of the wedding and the two kids more times than Namjoon could count.
It was very unusual. 
---
“I'm glad you finally brought a boyfriend with you, Jinnie. It's nice to see you with a good man. He could do with some fattening up, but that’s easy to take care of.”
“Mom!” a laugh, “Namjoonie isn't my boyfriend! And be quiet or else he'll hear you!”
---
Namjoon had heard.
It made that night a little more uncomfortable, as he laid out on the floor in Seokjin’s childhood bedroom. His legs tangled in too many blankets. He was too warm.
Everything was too warm.
Seokjin’s entire family was too warm.
---
They loved too much.
---
Namjoon tried not to show the discomfort. He was good at it, but Seokjin had learned to read him fairly well in the past two years.
---
“Mom, I’m really sorry. You know I planned on staying, but Yoongi and Hoseok had to come home early because of Taehyung and now they’ve all caught it. I’m the only person who knows Jimin well enough for him to be comfortable staying with me while his entire family is ill,” Seokjin smiled tightly, wrapping his arms around his mother. “You know I wouldn’t miss out on all of this food without a good reason.”
She sighed, but agreed. Packed him up some food to go and saw him to the door. Waved at Namjoon who was already seated and strapped into the passenger seat, hands clutching the duffel bag in his lap.
He tried to busy his fingers without using them to pick at the small holes in the fabric. So he raised a hand in response before finding his feet more interesting.
---
“Shouldn’t we be going to Hoseok and Yoongi’s so you can pick Jimin up on the way to your apartment?”
“They’re in Daegu, Namjoonie.”
“But you told your mom--.”
“I’m an adult. I can lie to my mom if I want to. Yoongi and Hoseok will understand.”
---
Namjoon was the one who didn’t understand.
He didn’t like not understanding.
---
Seokjin stopped the car in front of the bakery, but stopped Namjoon from upbuckling his seatbelt with a hand carefully touching the back of the younger’s. “I could drop you off at your apartment, Namjoonie. I’m giving you some of this food--Mom made me promise--and it might be too precarious for you to carry there.”
Namjoon shifted and didn’t speak for a few moments.
His heart beat too loud in his ears.
He pulled his hand away.
“Take a left at the end of the street,” defeated.
---
“Namjoon…,” Seokjin pursed his lips, frowning up at the building. “You live here?” trying not to be judgmental. Just making sure.
He’s afraid Namjoon decided to play a joke on him.
But Namjoon is quiet.
That’s more of a response than Seokjin needs.
---
“Well, this is home,” wetting his lips. “Bathroom’s on the left. Sometimes the knob sticks, but don’t worry, you’re not trapped. Just give it a good shove. Help yourself to anything in the fridge but, you know. Don’t drink the tap water.”
Seokjin smiles and laughs, but Namjoon doesn’t.
None of this feels like a joke.
---
“Why did you bring me here, Hyung?”
“Because.”
“That’s not an answer.”
“Yes, it is.”
---
Seokjin had given Namjoon the couch. It was too soft in Namjoon’s opinion.
Seokjin found the younger curled up on the floor the next morning, wrapped tight in the blankets he’d given him the night before.
Seokjin pretended not to have noticed when Namjoon finally wakes up.
---
Namjoon turns twenty-four in Seokjin’s apartment.
It’s an easy birthday.
The cake is lemon and poppy seed. The ganache and frosting is dark chocolate.
Nothing will taste better than the peanut butter and chocolate cake Namjoon had at twenty-three, but this is up there. 
---
Taehyung drops his glass of milk on the carpet in the living room.
Namjoon feels bad as the liquid spreads and stains the plush fabric.
If he wasn’t having a birthday, then Taehyung wouldn’t be in the apartment with a glass of milk to drop.
He insists on cleaning it up.
Seokjin tells him to sit down; it’s his birthday and Namjoon isn’t the maid. There’s only a small amount of bite to the words, as though Seokjin were reminding Namjoon of something, but Namjoon can’t figure out what it is.
Namjoon turns pink in the cheeks and pulls himself tight, sitting back down on the couch. He tries to make himself as small as possible. Tries to hide his hands in the sleeves of his sweater, but it’s old and his arms got longer between having purchased it and now.
---
Taehyung apologizes in the same breath he uses to ask for a second slice of cake.
---
Namjoon doesn’t understand how Seokjin isn’t angry.
Or how he can so easily cut a small sliver of cake for the child even after all the mess.
(And after, of course, making sure it was okay with his parents.) 
---
“Don’t apologize for living, Namjoon.” No nickname. Seokjin is watching him.
Namjoon glances away. The elder’s gaze burns.
“Don’t apologize for wanting to survive, Namjoon. Don’t feel bad for wanting better for yourself.”
---
It takes a long time.
---
Namjoon starts with his duffel bag. It’s tucked under the couch he doesn’t sleep on.
He upgrades after the first two weeks. Seokjin gives him a drawer. All of his clothes fit into it with room to spare.
But it means he has to walk into Seokjin’s bedroom to get things to change into.
---
One day, he discovers the drawer fuller than when he last looked.
A new sweater, similar to the ones he currently owns.
But it fits. He can pull his hands into the sleeves to hide them and their callouses.
A new pair of jeans.
They fit. Make it all the way down to his feet. Don’t have grease or dirt or holes.
Namjoon cries on the balcony and pretends it was the wind.
Seokjin vocalizes his uncertainty about wearing a hat. With wind that strong, it might mess up his hair.
Namjoon manages a tight laugh. Reminds him that hats can mess up hair as well.
---
“Why did you let me stay, Hyung?"
“Your twenty-third birthday.”
Namjoon furrows his brow.
“Just think about it, Namjoonie.”
Namjoon tries to. But that was a long time ago.
A lifetime ago.
A lot of things were a lifetime ago.
---
For Christmas, he gets a new coat and a section of the closet to hang it in. Socks without holes in them. A hat and scarf and gloves that match.
Taehyung says he bought Namjoon an elephant, but Papa made him return it because it was too big to fit into the apartment.
Jimin calls him a liar. Tells Namjoon there was never an elephant.
They wrestle in the living room and Namjoon laughs.
He stops them before they roll into the coffee table.
---
“Why did you bring me here, Hyung.”
Seokjin sighs. Cards his fingers through Namjoon’s hair. It smells of honey and ginger, now. Namjoon no longer smells of sickness.
Seokjin still smells of butter and milk and happiness.
Namjoon leans against the elder’s chest, fingers plucking at a loose thread in Seokjin’s flannel pajama bottoms.
“Because I only use love for those that are special to me, Namjoonie,” he shifts, reaching his free hand to tug the string on the lamp beside their bed. “Let’s get some sleep now. We’ve got an early day tomorrow.”
---
Namjoon turns twenty-five.
The cake is vanilla and orange.
Jimin helped write ‘happy birthday, Namjoonie-hyung’ on it.
Taehyung drew an elephant in purple frosting. He also spilled almost an entire container of sprinkles on top.
Namjoon tells them it’s a masterpiece. That it’s the best thing he’s ever seen.
---
He means it.
---
Seokjin turns twenty-seven. Namjoon gives him a book on cake decorating.
It’s old and worn and from a library over-stock sale.
Seokjin doesn’t really understand, but Namjoon doesn’t need him to.
Seokjin certainly understands that. And that's enough for them both.
---
Namjoon falls asleep with Seokjin reading the part about icing tips.
With Seokjin pressed to his back.
With Seokjin breathing softly against the short hairs on the back of his head.
With Seokjin rubbing gentle lines over his hip.
With Seokjin loving him more than Namjoon thought possible.
---
It could have been too much, but it was paradise.



Chapter End Notes
I'm sure there's a book out there that talks about icing tips and cake decorating. I'm sure there are multiple.But I did not think of one in particular while writing.But I was incredibly fond of writing small children Taehyung and Jimin and maybe that's something I'll do in the future.


Yoongi
Chapter Notes
Some chapters are longer than others. This has nothing to do with the pairing and more to do with the fact that the only plotting I did consisted of me saying something like ‘Okay, so Seokjin owns a bakery and he meets Namjoon and they somehow get together and I have to mention all members at some point’ six times with each member and job.I let the story come to a close as naturally as it wanted to.Also, this is the first one I wrote out of order. I did the start, then the ending. And then I filled in the middle.And this also gets a little dirty. Whoops.

        See the end of the chapter for more notes




He’s never worked in a tattoo parlor before. It’s a different atmosphere. More laid back.
The customers were different as well.
Some made Namjoon nervous.
But no one made him more nervous than his boss.
---
Min Yoongi was--he was different. He’d hired Namjoon because the younger had said he could draw. That he’d be good at designing tattoos. The way Namjoon spoke, Yoongi could have believed he’d gone to art school.
He was around the right age to graduate at least. Or he looked it. Sort of.
---
Yoongi was never very good with ages. That’s another reason he’d hired Namjoon.
He’d wanted a second set of eyes on customers, just to see if there was an agreement to their age. That they were certainly old enough to be getting a tattoo without their parents permission.
Yoongi didn’t want any legal cases to deal with.
It would be too much stress that he really didn't need in his life.
---
Watching ages and the front of the parlor became the only reason to keep Namjoon around quickly enough.
The kid couldn’t draw to save his life.
Yoongi pretended not to notice. Told him he did a good job and that he’d put the artwork in his book of designs.
---
Yoongi didn’t think he did a good job.
But he also didn’t fire Namjoon. The kid looked like he needed the work (and from the way he practically begged for the job, Yoongi had to assume he did) and Yoongi didn’t have the heart to toss him out without at least giving him a chance.
---
People often say Yoongi is cold.
Those people are wrong.
He just shows his affections in less obvious ways.
---
Besides, no one can be friends with Taehyung and Jimin and be cold.
It’s not possible.
You wouldn’t be able to survive.
---
It was early spring when Namjoon started the job. The tail end of winter, really. The time when some people would still be wearing their winter coats, but others would have shed them in favor of sweaters.
Yoongi was the former and it seemed that Namjoon was the later. 
---
The parlor was chilly most of the time. Yoongi kept it that way to save a few bucks. He didn’t really have too--he was popular. There was always a steady stream of customers coming in.
There were more, now, though.
He had something great to offer them that the other tattoo artists in the area didn’t.
---
Namjoon spoke English. He could write in English. He could translate and turn a phrase like Yoongi had never seen in a Korean man of their age.
Especially one that looked like Namjoon.
That looked like the streets.
Now, instead of having garbled English or ill-formed sentences, Yoongi’s customers could have accurate phrases etched permanently into their skin.
---
The year passed quickly. Namjoon kept the job.
He didn’t understand how, honestly. He didn’t do much.
He sat in the front. Greeted customers. Filed paperwork and processed payments.
Translated Korean phrases into English or found the right word when someone wanted it. Wrote them out carefully for Yoongi, double triple quadruple checking the spelling and meanings, just in case.
He didn’t want to mess up. Not with something as important as tattoos.
The parlor was only two blocks from his apartment. It was a relatively easy walk.
It would be nice in the dead of winter.
---
Namjoon turned twenty-three in the library. He read the same book on cake decorating. He could practically recite the chapter on icing tips.
---
Early October, Taehyung came for an appointment with his boyfriend, Jimin.
Namjoon had never met another man who exclusively liked other men, let alone two.
Yoongi didn’t bat an eye.
He settled in with Namjoon’s written words on the table and the needle in his steady hands.
Taehyung played with Jimin’s fingers while the work was being done. He kissed them every so often, leaving small patches of shiny, wet spit.
Jimin didn’t seem phased.
He didn’t seem to mind at all.
In fact, he seemed to watch the way the saliva reflected the light as though it were heaven sent.
Taehyung just kissed him more, leaving Jimin a giggling mess.
It made the tattooing process that much more difficult.
---
But Namjoon wondered if that what it meant to be in love.
Not minding someone else’s spit on your fingers.
---
“What’s it say again?”
Namjoon shifted. “Love is friendship set on fire.”
“...and in Korean?”
Namjoon obliged, taking small liberties in the translation.
Jimin didn't take his eyes away from his lover, though he'd been speaking to Namjoon.  “I love it, Taehyung.”
“I love you.”
Yoongi yells at the pair and kicks them out of the parlor before they knock something important over with their childish bickering and wrestling about.
They leave with grins brighter than the sun.
---
Things are considerably easy in the warm months. Namjoon doesn't have to decide between a meal and heating. A meal or an extra pair of socks.
He can strip down to ratty boxers and lay on the kitchen floor in his apartment. Drink warm water and eat crackers or bread or, every so often, apples and peanut butter.
On the particularly heated days, he goes so far as to buy off brand ice cream to enjoy.
It's a splurge and a budget stretcher, but he survives.
But as winter starts, things get significantly more difficult. 
---
It's amazing how quickly someone can lose weight when their meals drop below an average of one a day. 
---
Yoongi only really notices after a few weeks. Winter hit early and he kept some heat on in the front lobby. Namjoon seemed intent to wear thin sweaters despite the cold, and his coat was ratty and old--perhaps he was more sentimental than Yoongi originally thought. So Yoongi kept the heat a little higher in the lobby than he would otherwise, if only for Namjoon’s sake.
Whatever the case, Namjoon’s helping him move a box to a higher shelf, and his old, thin sweater rides up, revealing a flat stomach.
One that is unnaturally so.
One that is unhealthily so.
Yoongi asks without thinking.
“Have you been eating?”
There’s evident concern threaded into the question. Yoongi’s brows are furrowed and he waits for the answer he knows he’ll be getting.
---
Namjoon hadn't expected the question. Yoongi never seemed to press before. Never asked too many things. Never wondered outright.
Namjoon liked it that way.
It made living much easier. With no one to worry about him, he didn’t have to worry about anyone either. Caring could make things messy.
---
“Yeah. I have been.”
“Oh. Okay.”
---
Namjoon thinks that's going to be the end of it. Yoongi doesn't bring it up again.
---
A week later, Yoongi’s left an apple on the front desk when Namjoon comes in. The day after that, an orange.
A banana.
A small container of grapes.
Then, bigger things.
A wrapped ham and cheddar sandwich with lettuce and tomato.
Triangle kimbap and a bottle of pop.
Carrot sticks and a cup of peanut butter. 
---
Everything tastes like heaven.
---
Yoongi never says explicitly that they're for Namjoon, and Namjoon doesn't ask. He busies his mouth with eating, instead. Stops only to speak to customers.
Yoongi doesn't interrupt when he knows Namjoon is eating. He doesn't want the man to feel embarrassed or like he's been caught with his hand in the cookie jar.
Yoongi leaves him a small stack of cookies the day before he closes for the Christmas holiday. 
---
“You've got somewhere to go for the holidays?”
“My apartment, ” it was a hesitant response.
“I'm not going back to Daegu this year. My family took a vacation. You should come over to my place. I plan on making lamb skewers, and it's no fun to eat alone.”
Not one to pass up free food, especially meat, Namjoon agrees quickly.
---
On New Year's, Yoongi is visited by some drunk college students. He convinces one to get Namjoon’s artwork as a tattoo. He takes a photo of the image with the guys phone so he doesn't try to get his money back the next day.
And then Yoongi takes a photo of the ink on the kid's arm to show Namjoon when he works next.
---
“It's funny because his name is almost Jungcock.” Yoongi glances back down to ID on the counter.
Jungkook, Jungcock. Close enough. Whatever the case, the kid is barely legal and way too drunk for this.
He gets the needle ready regardless.
“Your name is Hoseok.”
“Yeah, well yours is Seokjin. That's ‘J’, ‘in’. Which could be jizz in,” a hiccup that just has to hurt. Yoongi winces at how hard the kid’s body jerks with the sound. They should have all stopped three or four drinks ago, he's sure. “Like you had jizz inside you,” snickering follows. Hoseok thinks he's pretty funny right now. Yoongi doesn’t agree, and it seems neither do Jungkook or Seokjin.
“Hoseok,” even drunk, Seokjin is being pretty patient. Yoongi is impressed with the other’s abilities. “You were riding my dick this morning, asking me to fill you with my cum. And then you stuck a plug in--which by the way, I don't think is sanitary?” He didn't seem sure, but Yoongi chalked that up to the alcohol in the stranger's system. “But whatever. The point is, if any of us has jizz in them, it's you. You haven’t taken that fucking thing out all day.”
Jungkook just snorts from his spot in the chair. He knows the truth.
---
The truth is that they're both wusses and wouldn’t have gotten a tattoo without needing to be held down. Jungkook, on the other hand, is brave and strong and great with the ladies and passionate, charming, as kind as he is handsome, and heir to a thro--.
Perhaps he should hold back on how often he watches musicals.
It’s not good for his image.
---
Sometimes, Yoongi wonders if anyone would ever believe him if he told them the stories he has collected from working in this business.
He doubts it.
---
“I told him he was too chicken to get it. He disagreed.”
“Yoongi-hyung! You shouldn't have done that!”
“You drew a terrible rendition of a chicken,  Namjoon-ah. I thought it only fitting.”
Namjoon hasn't laughed this much in a long while. His ribs and stomach hurt, but that's okay too.
---
Namjoon turned twenty-four at the tattoo parlor. Yoongi asked if he wanted some ink after taking a gulp of soju.
Namjoon snorted and took a bite of drug store cake.
Yoongi had bought it and the soju last minute. It tasted terrible.
But it also tasted like heaven. Namjoon would eat the entire thing before the night was over.
“Not if you're drinking, Hyung. You're good, but I don't think I trust you that much.”
---
After a few more drinks, they wind up at Yoongi’s apartment. It’s the first time Namjoon has been there since Christmas last year. He can almost taste the lamb skewers on his tongue the minute he steps inside.
---
After a few more drinks, they wind up kissing on the couch.
Neither are drunk enough to do anything stupid. They're just drunk enough not to care when their lips and tongues and mouths meet.
---
Yoongi isn't the first man Namjoon’s kissed.
But he's the first man Namjoon’s actually liked.
And he’s the first man who could potentially like him back.
All the others had been much too drunk to realize there were no breasts attached to the body their mouth had found.
---
It happens fast after that. The next week, Yoongi is stopping Namjoon on his way out of the shop.
“Stop paying your rent.”
“What? Hyung, if I stop doing that, I'll get evicted. I know it’s not much but I...I need my apartment.”
“No, you don't. Come live with me. It's that simple.”
---
It really is that simple. 
---
As Yoongi predicted, Namjoon doesn't have a lot of things. An old duffel bag that's seen better days and some clothes.  Nothing else, really.
But Yoongi doesn't mind.
It leaves space for growing.
It also means he has to throw out less of his own stuff.
---
Yoongi might be more sentimental than he lets on.
---
Yoongi wakes up in the middle of the first night to find Namjoon had slipped out of the bed at some point and curled up on the floor.
Yoongi can't blame him.
If Yoongi had been sleeping on the floor for the last nine years, he'd be uncomfortable on a bed too.
So Yoongi simply threw a blanket over the others larger frame and a pillow near his head, and settled back down sleep on the bed, spreading out like he usually does. 
---
He doesn’t mention it the next morning. Nor the morning after that. Eventually, he leaves a few blankets down there, just to make it more normal for Namjoon.
---
But it gets easier, of course. Namjoon slowly gets used to curling under soft blankets on the soft mattress.
He gets used to having three meals a day.
(They both learn quickly that a body can’t go from zero to a hundred without some form of conditioning. Yoongi attempted to get Namjoon caught up on all the meals he’d missed over the years at once. It left the younger a mess for an entire week, hunching over the toilet, eyes stinging and wet with every heave.)
(Yoongi slowed down after that, clearly rattled from the hellish week of puking. He measured out portions and made sure the food was healthy.)
---
Namjoon gets used to loving someone.
Namjoon gets used to being loved in return.
---
Sometimes, he traces his fingers over the ink across Yoongi’s skin. The colors that cover the old scars that mar pale flesh.
The large, powder blue butterfly wings across his shoulder blades. They’re delicate, almost. Not what Namjoon would have expected from Yoongi upon the first meeting.
Then, there’s the daffodils and asters that grow up and down his spine. Baby yellows and pinks and greens, blooming over distorted skin.
A network of watercolor ravens taking flight around his hips.
The small infinity sign painted on the instep of his left foot.
White inked dandelion seeds blown by an unseen breeze up the insides of his right arm, floating over faded lines.
---
Namjoon runs his fingers across the lines and wonders about their stories. Yoongi shares, sometimes. Usually when he’s overtired or slightly tipsy.
Namjoon never remembers the tellings. He’s always overtired or slightly tipsy right along with him.
---
Namjoon doesn’t ask what happened to Yoongi’s skin. He thinks that, if it’s important enough, Yoongi will tell him.
He knows the feeling of secrets best kept in silence. He doesn’t press or question.
---
Namjoon turns twenty-five. He and Yoongi visit a zoo and make fun of the lions for yawning. They eat too much cake and drink too much soju and fall asleep fully clothed in a tangle of limbs.
In the morning, Namjoon makes fun of Yoongi for yawning.
Yoongi throws a pillow at his face.
---
For good measure, he yawns again.
---
“I’m thinking about getting a tattoo.”
“First one for employees is on the house,” Yoongi smiles slyly. Like he’d charge Namjoon for anything.
Perhaps he’d make him pay in kisses.
It’s a pleasant thought. A distracting one. It takes Yoongi a moment to get his mind back on track.
He continues. “What were you thinking?”
Namjoon doesn’t respond at first. He lets the question sit and stew.
Finally, he speaks; but it’s English that comes out.
“The sun will rise and we will try again.”
---
It hurts, but Namjoon doesn’t mind the sting.
He’s been hurt a lot worse in the past. He’s been hurt in a lot worse ways in the past.
The words scrawl across his left hip bone, fancy and black.
---
When he’s done, Yoongi presses a gentle kiss to Namjoon’s ribs.
---
Yoongi never asks what it means. (Though he wants to.)
Never questions it when he sees it. (Which is often.)
Never stops kissing the words. (He wouldn’t dream of it.)
---
Namjoon wouldn’t want it any other way. 
---
It’s strange to think he found heaven tucked into the back room of a tattoo parlor, but somehow, Namjoon managed.



Chapter End Notes
“Love is friendship set on fire” - Ann Landers. This has a couple of other sources, but this seemed the most prevalent.Jungkook is referring to Agony from Into the Woods. Musicals mess up the bad boy image, but he can't get enough of them.Daffodils are the birth flower of March and asters are the flower of September. The rest of the tattoos don’t really have a solid meaning. Mostly about time and journeys and freedom and escape and blah blah blah symbolism I never matched to anything important in the story itself.“The sun will rise and we will try again.” - Truce; Twenty-One Pilots. The song is very simple and short, but so, so good. There are a couple of proposed meanings to the song and this line in particular.. If you look into it, it adds a different meaning to the story, I guess, haha. I just thought it fit pretty well.Next up is Hoseok!


Hoseok
Chapter Notes
I had one playlist to listen to while writing this entire story. It consisted entirely of slow to slow-ish songs as well as songs I'd classify as 'soft' sounding. I have trouble writing to bops and jams because all I want to do is dance and sing. When the songs are slow, I can reign myself in and keep it to singing.

        See the end of the chapter for more notes




Namjoon had never worked at a dance studio before. He’d been a cleaner before--he’d worked at hotels and motels and, once, for a family.
Before they realized how clumsy he was.
He created more messes than he cleaned, sometimes.
(But he tried, and that had to count for something, right?)
---
He doesn’t know what made him apply. Perhaps it was the name of the studio--Hope on the Streets--or simply because it had a ‘help wanted’ sign in the front window.
It was probably the sign.
Namjoon didn’t put much stock in hope.
Not anymore at least.
---
But he did get the job.
So there’s that.
---
Hoseok was...an interesting boss. He was more energetic than Namjoon expected. They were the same age, but Hoseok was just more.
More everything. More smiles and more laughs. More talking and more movements.
Namjoon liked him, of course. You’d be hard pressed to find someone who didn’t. He chatted easily and remembered everything anyone had ever told him about themselves.
Sometimes, it was all just too much.
Hoseok was kind and caring. He always greeted Namjoon when he came in and always asked how his day was. He told Namjoon not to stay too long and not to work too hard. Smiled all the while and laughed his way out of the studio. Namjoon half expected him to chat with himself on the drive back to wherever Hoseok lived.
Perhaps he called someone and was a very unsafe driver.
Namjoon couldn’t tell.
---
The job was simple--show up an hour before closing and stay as long as it took to finish the cleaning or maintenance list Hoseok left for him.
In the past, there had been employees who’d dawdled. Wasted hours doing nothing to get more pay. So Hoseok had switched to a lump sum for every night. On days with more work, there was more pay.
It worked out in the end.
Namjoon didn’t mind.
He went home each day with a pocketful of cash.
He couldn’t complain.
---
Namjoon had never seen Hoseok dance. Each time he came in, there would be a note attached to the cleaner’s closet with a list of what needed done, and Namjoon would set about doing it.
Nothing was too difficult, really.
Sweep and mop the floors, wipe off the few counters, clean the mirrored walls in the studio rooms, sanitize the dance equipment, make sure the bathrooms were in working order.
Every so often, he’d be asked to fix something.
A blown bulb, a leaky faucet, a loose screw.
Anything more than that would need a specialist called in, but Namjoon was handy when he wasn’t breaking things.
---
The specialist turned out to be the father of one of Hoseok’s younger students. Jungkook’s dad, Yoongi, was very good with a wrench and screwdriver.
Namjoon was only a little jealous.
He’d lost a job once because he didn’t know the difference between a flathead and a phillips. Yoongi, on the other hand, seemed to know what he needed even before looking at the screw itself. Hoseok would say what needed fixing when the man arrived to pick up his child, and Yoongi would ask for the proper piece of equipment.
---
Regardless, Namjoon would come in an hour before closing and start on his list.
Before Hoseok would leave, he’d track Namjoon down and thank him for coming in. Pay him what he’d earned the night before, and bid him a fond goodbye.
He’d always tell Namjoon to stay safe.
And then Hoseok would leave, chatting still, even as he left Namjoon behind.
Namjoon didn’t mind the well wishes.
---
In the summer months, the studio was kept cool. Namjoon was thankful for the chilly air after spending the days trying and failing to sleep in the heat of his apartment. Small as it was, it retained heat like nothing he’d ever known.
It was a desert. Too hot and too stuffy and too much.
There’s only so much good stripping down to boxers can do.
There’s only so much cool air an open window can bring in, especially without a breeze to actually create the cool air that’s not coming in.
So Namjoon relished his time at the studio.
Sometimes, he dreamed of being able to bottle up the chill and take it home.
---
“You do anything fun today, Namjoon?”
“Not really. I’m reading a few good books right now.”
“A few? More than one at a time? Man, I’d kill for that kind of concentration! I’m absolute shit at things like that!” There’s infectious laughter.
Namjoon can’t hold in a soft chuckle in response. “Yeah, well. It’s a good time waster, I guess.”
“What’s your favorite of the ones you’re reading?”
Namjon pauses and thinks about the best way to easily explain the novel. “It’s about a little girl who steals books.”
Hoseok furrows his brows, but doesn’t question it. He tells him it sounds interesting and starts talking about his older classes, even as he’s leaving the room.
---
Namjoon turned twenty-three at the studio. He worked over the nights, so he was there when the clock struck twelve AM.
Namjoon started to recite the first chapter of the cake decorating book as he sprayed glass cleaner on the mirror. He didn’t get that far in the recitation. It’s not like he memorized it.
---
Hoseok asks what Namjoon is doing for Chuseok. Namjoon lies. Kind of. He says his family is busy and that he won’t be going to Ilsan to celebrate since they won't be there.
Hoseok tells him it’s a pity. Everyone should be with their families on a holiday like that. He talks about his older sister and his parents. How his sister might be bringing her boyfriend to celebrate with them.
It seems pretty foreign to Namjoon, but he smiles and nods along, waiting patiently for Hoseok to exit the room mid sentence.
---
Hoseok doesn’t disappoint.
---
Namjoon realized the studio was incredibly warm the first night it drops below freezing. It’s well into December, almost Christmas, before the temperature goes down and the snow starts piling up.
Namjoon is too busy mopping a floor to realize what’s falling from the sky. By the time he looks up, there’s several inches of snow and more to come.
He’s confused because he doesn’t feel it.
The cold.
He’s never not felt cold in the winter.
(He supposes he used to feel warm, before he was sixteen. But then his world fell apart. It’s hard to remember any time before now. There’s been too many lifetimes.)
So it’s different.
He likes it.
---
Namjoon finishes his cleaning. He turns off all the lights but those in the lobby.
And then he sits there for an extra hour, watching the snow fall and sipping water from a disposable cup.
He supposes to the average person, the lobby is still chilly. It’s a relatively large room and Hoseok turns the heat down when he leaves--with just Namjoon here, why heat all the rooms in the building?
But to Namjoon, this place is the desert at high noon.
He loves it.
---
“Any plans for Christmas this year, Namjoon? I’m going to visit my family in Gwanju--my sister’s bringing her boyfriend again and my mother got a new dog. I think they named him Mickey? I’m not sure. But I’m definitely excited!”
Namjoon just shrugs. “Not really. My...my family is out of town,” he doesn’t look over. Concentrates on a nonexistent spot on the ground.
He wonders why the mop isn’t cleaning it up before realizing it’s because the stain isn’t there.
“Ah. Well, perhaps next year then! Don’t work too hard tonight, okay? And if you want to order take out for yourself, you can have it delivered here,” Hoseok hesitates for a moment. “You know that right?”
His response is a nod. They bid each other goodnight and safe trips and happy holidays.
Namjoon goes to find an actual spot to clean.
---
Namjoon amazes at the heat of the studio all winter. Stays there longer than he needs to just to bask in it at night. He makes sure he’s gone before Hoseok comes in the morning, but for a couple of hours, he’s cozy.
Then he returns to his apartment and potentially frozen bottles of water.
---
Spring comes and goes.
The flowers bloom. Namjoon notices that there are a few well-kept patches in front of the studio. He hadn’t seen them when he got the job as the time for flowers had past. But now, the flowers bloom with reckless abandon, blossoming and growing thick in their patches. Yellow daffodils and purple hyacinths. There are tulip leaves, but Namjoon never catches any blooming.
He would ask if Hoseok hired a gardener, but the first day he notices the flowers, he also notices grass and soil stains on the knees of the jeans Hoseok’s leaving the studio in.
Namjoon would never have pegged him as the gardening kind.
---
He has to admit, though.
It suits Hoseok well.
It takes patience and love, and Hoseok has that in droves.
---
Summer passes quickly.
The studio stays chilly and cold. Namjoon stays there well into the early morning just to keep cool, even if he won’t be able to feel it when he’s trying to sleep in his apartment.
---
Fall hits late.
---
Namjoon turns twenty-four in the studio. He rented the cake decorating book and sits in the small office to read it.
He returns the book the next day, but doesn’t rent anything else.
---
Hoseok goes home for Chuseok. He asks Namjoon if he’ll be spending time with his family.
Namjoon says they’re traveling.
Hoseok jokes about frequent flier miles.
Namjoon forces a laugh.
Hoseok can tell.
He calls in and pays for take out to the studio when he gets home. At least Namjoon will have a nice meal before Chuseok, even if it’s delivery Chinese.
---
Winter hits early.
---
Namjoon’s shivering when he enters the studio. It’s barely November and the temperatures almost freezing. There’s call for snow.
He’s pretty positive they’ll get it.
---
Namjoon’s not wrong. He walks home through at least five inches of freshly fallen snow.
His feet are cold inside his shoes.
They’re still damp the next day when he heads into work.
---
It’s the fourth of December and Hoseok closed and left early. He has a friend celebrating a birthday.
Namjoon isn’t too sure what his name is. All he knows is that Hoseok and his friends boyfriend (Minji? Jinmin?) planned a surprise party. Apparently, the boyfriend picked Hoseok over their other friend (Hyun-something. Or was it Lae-something?) (Namjoon only slightly pays attention to Hoseok’s mutterings. Anymore at least. He used to hang on every word, just in case they were important to his job) (they never were) because the other friend doesn’t know how to keep his mouth shut.
Namjoon’s never met this Laehyun fellow, but he’s sure he’d be a real treat from the way Hoseok speaks of him. He always looks fond, but there’s just this feeling about him when the name comes up.
---
It’s the fourth of December and Hoseok closed and left early. He has a friend celebrating a birthday.
Namjoon has known this day was coming for a few weeks and he planned accordingly.
---
He already has a key to lock up when he finishes cleaning, so getting into the locked building isn’t hard. No, that’s the easiest part.
The hard part is deciding he doesn’t mind taking advantage of Hoseok. It’s hard--the man is so nice. So kind.
So much.
But Namjoon is cold and after all this time, he’s used to doing what he needs to in order to survive.
---
During the day, Namjoon hides his duffel bag in one of the changing room lockers. He had brought it the night before. Left it in the cleaning closet until Hoseok went home for the night, then moved it to the locker room.
Namjoon hangs out at the library and hopes no one finds his old duffel. He naps over a book at his table. He drinks water from the fountain. He eats snacks the library women give him.
And at night, Namjoon returns to the studio. He cleans quickly. Tries to get everything done between the hours of eight and twelve.
---
The first night is the worst. He’s paranoid something bad is going to happen. He’s worried it’s not going to work.
But on the fourth of December, Hoseok has a friend celebrating a birthday.
So on the fourth of December, one of the coldest days yet, Namjoon holes himself up in the office.
And Namjoon sleeps.
He brought two of his blankets and left the rest in his apartment. He’s not sure if he’ll get away with what he’s doing, so he paid the rent for the month.
Come morning--more like five--he wakes up to the alarm he set on Hoseok’s desk clock. Folds his blankets and puts them in the locker with his duffel. Showers in water so hot it turns his skin pink. He loves it. He can’t get enough of the scald and the steam.
Namjon changes into clean clothes and he leaves the studio.
Namjoon wanders to a convenience store and goes from one to another until the library opens, then he goes there to waste away the day.
---
On the fifth of December, Namjoon does the whole thing again. He still feels bad. But it’s a little easier.
---
Every night, it’s a little easier.
---
Hoseok asks about Christmas.
---
Hoseok asks about New Year’s.
---
Namjoon’s family is busy. Namjoon’s family is traveling. Namjoon’s family is doing anything and everything but being at home at the important times.
Hoseok tries not to look worried. He tries not to look bothered.
He tries not to be concerned because Namjoon is an adult. It’s not Hoseok’s place to pry. It’s never his place to pry. But, sometimes.
Sometimes, he pries.
---
It’s strange not paying his rent when January hits. Namjoon feels like he’s cheating. Like he’s lying. Like he’s doing wrong.
Really, he is.
He’s a squatter, now. Living in a building he shouldn’t be living in. But it’s an oasis in the desert and Namjoon is cold.
So he sleeps on the floor of the office, curled up on and under thin blankets. He wakes early and showers in too hot water, stashes his things in a locker, and spends the day in the library.
---
The office has a small fridge with bottles of water in it. Namjoon can keep one in there for the night and take it with him in the morning. It’s nice, having cold water. Even in the winter, it’s nice.
The office has a microwave. Sometimes, Hoseok brings leftovers for his lunch or dinner, Namjoon knows. Hoseok heats them up and eats them and, even when Namjoon comes in at eight, the office smells like whatever it was Hoseok was eating earlier in the day.
But Namjoon can use the microwave to heat up convenience store ramen cups or sausages when he gets them. It’s becoming more and more common for him to get convenience store ramen cups or sausages.
He’s not paying rent, so he has more money to spend on food.
---
Namjoon puts on a few pounds. It’s all salt and sausages and ramen.
---
He doesn’t care.
Sometimes, he stands in the steamy, scalding shower and prods at his stomach, amazed that he’s feeling anything there at all.
He keeps it up until his skin is so pink from the hot water that he’s leaving white prints each time his fingers connect to his belly.
---
Hoseok sometimes jokes that Namjoon’s a stick.
Hoseok has muscle. He can’t be a stick.
Namjoon has skin. Namjoon has bones.
Namjoon is nothing but a stick.
But now he’s a few more pounds of skin and bones thanks to salt and sausages and ramen. His face is always a little puffy, but he doesn’t complain. He wouldn't, when it comes from a full stomach.
---
In the summer, Namjoon enjoys sleeping in the chill. There’s no heat in the summer. There’s only coolness.
Outside may be a desert, but the office might as well be the arctic.
And in the sweltering heat of the summer, Namjoon’s perfectly comfortable in the chilliest of polar tundras.
---
Namjoon almost gets caught once. It’s the tail end of summer and he forgot Hoseok was coming in early to get things ready for a recital for the younger students he teaches.
Namjoon just barely gets his blankets put away in the locker and his towel in the laundry bin.
He has to duck back into the showers while Hoseok inspects the costumes the children will wear.
Hoseok mumbles to himself. He makes simple discussion with the air about which children have improved the most. Which he’s the proudest of. (It’s all of them. They work so hard and practice so much. They try to make Hoseok happy and proud. Namjoon finds it quaint that Hoseok can’t pick a favorite.)
When Hoseok leaves the locker room, Namjoon ducks out of the showers. He scurries out of the building and rushes to be as far away as fast he can.
---
He still stays there that night. He has nowhere else to go, now.
He just makes sure he pays more attention to Hoseok’s schedule of events so he doesn't get almost caught again.
Or worse.
Caught.
---
Namjoon turns twenty-five at the studio. He tried to rent the book on cake decorating, but the library sold it in a book sale.
According to the library women, it was an amazingly handsome man who thought it would look perfect in his living room.
Namjoon doesn't rent anything else. He's pretty disappointed.
---
Hoseok doesn’t ask about Chuseok this year.
He doesn’t think he could hide his expressions again when Namjoon tells him his family is traveling or busy or going out of town or anything and everything but being there when Namjoon so clearly needs them.
Instead, he orders take out to the studio once more. Namjoon appreciates it, even if he doesn’t say anything about it the following night.
---
Winter hits mildly at first. But Namjoon is sure it'll get worse. It usually does.
---
Being able to actually save some money is amazing to him. It means that, as heavy winter approaches, he's able to purchase a new cold weather coat. He hasn't had one since he was seventeen.
New is, of course, a relative term. He gets it from a thrift store, but it fits well enough and isn't too ratty. The sleeves reach his hands.
He's pretty happy. He can't complain too much.
Well.
He could.
But he won't.
---
Namjoon is right about the weather. Before Christmas, the sky opens up a dreadful sight. Buckets and pails and bathtubs full of snow tumble from the heavens. It sticks. It lays. It cakes the ground and roads and sidewalks. No amount of sun the following day could make it disappear.
And the sun does try. It spills heat out over the following days, trying to remove what the rest of the sky had done, but it’s impossible.
---
After that, things fall apart more suddenly than Namjoon expects.
---
Namjoon is asleep. Dead to the world. It's an incredibly cold night. There's frost and ice and sleet everywhere. A biting bitter wind that leaves unprotected cheeks red and throbbing. Leaves noses running. Leaves eyes watering with stinging tears.
Namjoon is asleep. He's burrowed under his two thin blankets and his coat.
Namjoon is asleep. He's wearing two sweaters and three pairs of socks on his feet and gloves on his hands.
Namjoon is asleep and Hoseok forgot his cellphone on his desk at work.
Namjoon is asleep and Hoseok stands in the doorway of his office, unsure what to do about the sleeping figure on his floor.
---
Hoseok knew, of course, that Namjoon wasn't well off. The way he carried himself. The way he dressed. The way he spoke and avoided questions.
The way he always seemed hungry, and not just for food.
(He thinks the phrase is touch starved. He’s not sure--it’s definitely not something Hoseok has a problem with. He never has. His mother pet him so much when he was little that it’s difficult for him to fall asleep without running his own hands up and down his arms.)
But Hoseok didn't want to pry. He didn't want to bother or irritate or agitate. He's been told he does too much when he tries to help.
And, certainly, he's told his friend about the new janitor he has. The handsome tall man who's just too damn skinny. Who never brings snacks with him. (An appalling thought to Hoseok who lives off fruit cups and carrot sticks while he’s at the studio.) Who wears threadbare sweaters all fall and winter and spring and ratty t-shirts the other times. Who's got a pair of jeans that are too short and show his ankles and are covered in grease stains. Who has sneakers that are falling apart at the seams.
How Hoseok pays him more than he paid the previous janitors because it's clear he needs it. It's clear he's struggling and it's the least Hoseok can do--Namjoon cleans the bathroom after all. The bathroom that is often used by very small children who have very bad aim.
In Hoseok’s eyes, that's worth extra payment.
---
But never in a million years would Hoseok have thought this of all things. That his janitor was living in his office. His studio.
Hoseok’s safe place.
It was, apparently, also Namjoon s safe place as well.
---
Hoseok tip toes into his office and retrieves his phone, ducking back out quietly, hoping he hadn't woken Namjoon up.
---
He hadn't. Namjoon was none the wiser come five the next morning.
---
Hoseok brought it up to his friends the next time they met up for drinks.
One suggested he call the cops.
The other suggested he try and make Namjoon more comfortable.
---
Not wanting to lose a good worker and acquaintance, Hoseok chose the later option.
(And also because he’s not a jerk.)
---
The next week, Namjoon found a pillow abandoned in the corner where he sleeps. It could easily have been left there from a nap Hoseok took. He must have just tossed the pillow away from his desk when he woke up.
But Namjoon uses it anyway.
He laid it carefully on the office chair when he woke up to leave the next day.
That’s how Hoseok finds it.
---
Hoseok comes in early that day. Not too early. About a half hour before he typically does.
He doesn’t want to catch Namjoon. He just wants to poke around.
It doesn’t take him long to find Namjoon’s duffel bag and blankets. Hoseok pulls it all out and lays it across the ground. Counts the pairs of mismatched socks and mittens. The hats with worn out holes. The sweaters so thin they can practically be seen through. Jeans short and frayed and ripped with holes crudely sewn together with the wrong color and kind of thread.
He carefully refolds each article and places it back in the bag. The bag is returned to the locker.
Hoseok opens the studio like nothing’s happened.
---
He’s not sure what he wants to do about it. He leaves the pillow on the floor again that night, but doesn’t do much else.
There’s not much he can do right now. He needs to think.
He needs to make sure he’s not doing too much.
---
“Is everything okay, Namjoon?”
The other glances over from the cleaning closet. Frowns. “Yes...why?”
“I was just--no reason. I was just wondering, I guess.” A pause. Hoseok shifts his weight. “Would you like to get dinner tomorrow?” Namjoon looks hesitant and is clearly about to refuse. “I’ll buy. I mean, it’s the least I can do. I just feel like you’re doing such a great job and I want to reward you. I mean--I mean, I pay you to do the work, but…” Hoseok shrugs.
Namjoon swallows.
“Okay. I--yeah. Sure. What time should I be here?”
---
Dinner is only slightly awkward. After the first fifteen minutes, Hoseok decides it’s probably best to get them some alcohol. They each get a bottle of soju and settle in, waiting for the food to arrive.
It’ll have lots and lots of meat.
He even got them lunchboxes.
---
Namjoon’s not dumb. He knows he shouldn’t be eating as much as he is. Not such rich foods. Not such greasy foods.
Not so much.
But he does. Because when will he get this chance again?
---
He regrets it when Hoseok’s standing slightly behind him and slightly beside him in a dim alley a block from the restaurant.
He regrets it when Hoseok’s rubbing small circles into his back through the new-to-Namjoon winter coat.
He regrets it when he’s throwing up everything he just enjoyed swallowing down and when his eyes sting and grow wet from the effort it takes to heave everything out of his stomach.
---
But Hoseok stays. He doesn’t have to, but he stays. He rubs circles and speaks calmly. He tries to soothe with quiet words, palms smoothing over fabric over layered fabric over skin. It’s a level of voice Namjoon hasn’t heard from the man yet--typically, he’s loud and excitable. But right now?
Now he’s soft and gentle. A breeze in the wind.
“It’s okay, Namjoon. It’s all going to be okay. You just calm down, alright? Try and take some deep breaths when you’re able. In through your nose, out through your mouth. Don’t stress yourself out too much. I’m here for you.”
Namjoon heaves again.
Hoseok continues his barrage of words. He thinks the more he says, the better off they’ll both be. It’s best to fill the quiet. “I’m here for you, Namjoon. Breathe, please. In and out. There we go. It’s going to be okay. I promise it’s going to be okay.”
---
It’s another couple of minutes before Namjoon spits out bile for the last time and works to right himself, green and queasy.
Green may be Hoseok’s favorite color, but this shade is not the best. It’s pretty gross. A lot of what just happened is gross. But Hoseok works with kids, mostly, and he’s used to things like this. Perhaps not in this quantity, but nevertheless.
---
“How far away is your apartment?”
Namjoon doesn’t respond. Hoseok knows why. Namjoon works his mouth for a moment. Then shakes his head slowly. “Too far. I need to lay down,” a weak laugh. His stomach churns.
It’s not from the laughter.
Hoseok looks concerned. He’s ready to jump out of the way so Namjoon doesn’t ruin his shoes. He doesn’t actually have to and, instead, he reaches up to push Namjoon’s sweaty bangs from his forehead. The look he’s left with isn’t unattractive, but it would be better if the man didn’t look so ill.
“Mine is about half a block from here. Think you could make it that far?” there’s a small shrug in response. “I might have something you can wear--you’re a little lankier than me, but some PJ’s might fit. Come on.”
He doesn’t take ‘no’ for an answer.
---
Namjoon does try to refuse.
---
Hoseok’s apartment is nice. Not too big, but not too small. The bedroom is a separate room. The bathroom is tiny, but has a tub. The kitchen isn’t anything fancy. (Hoseok mentions offhandedly that he doesn't do a whole lot of cooking. Mostly uses the stove and oven to heat up leftovers the microwave doesn’t do justice to.) There are a few potted plants and flowers on the windowsills, but nothing too large. Namjoon is surprised they’re doing so well in the middle of winter.
“Wait here; there’s water bottles in the fridge if you want one. I’m going to go find you something to wear.” And he goes off.
Namjoon looks around for a short time. Leaves his coat on the hook by the door and inspects photographs on the walls. They’re of Hoseok and friends and family (Namjoon assumes at least. They look happy.)
(It reminds him of himself at fifteen. But that was lifetimes ago. He doesn’t remember what he looked like back then--he doesn’t have any pictures. He doesn’t know if his family kept any either.)
(He supposes it doesn’t matter.)
When Hoseok returns, Namjoon is looking intently at a photography of Hoseok and another man, tightly gripping each other around the waist. The other man is kissing Hoseok’s cheek.
Photo Hoseok is thinner and his eyes are a little sunken, but he’s blushing.
“That’s Taehyung. We used to be a thing, but it turns out, we’re better off as friends.”
Namjoon jumps, turning quickly to try and appear as though he weren’t staring at the photograph.
Hoseok’s smiling though. “Remember Seokjin? The surprise party?” Namjoon nods, even if he doesn’t remember. “He and Jimin were together for a few years.” Hoseok pauses. “Now they’re with Taehyung.”
Furrowed brows. “All three of them?” It’s a new and surprising concept.
Hoseok nods cautiously, nervous. “Yeah.” He seems to be unsure of the response, as though he’s leaving something out.
“Ah.” Namjoon doesn’t ask about the information Hoseok doesn’t provide.
---
“Who took all these pictures? They’re pretty good.”
“Jimin. He loves photography. Doesn’t do it for a living, but takes pictures when he gets the chance.”
“Ah. Did he want to?”
“Yeah, but there’s not good money unless you’re famous.”
“Oh.”
“Yeah. He’s a nurse, now.”
“That must be interesting.”
“Sometimes. But blood makes me squeamish, so he doesn't talk about work much.”
---
Namjoon feels better once he’s got a bottle and a half of water in him. His mouth tastes better, too.
Hoseok was right. The pajamas don’t quite fit. They’re a little too tight in some places and loose in others. Neither the sleeves or the pants are quite long enough. Namjoon doesn’t complain.
The apartment is warm and cozy. There’s a TV, which is something Namjoon hasn’t watched much of.
(Sometimes he wonders what happened on his favorite shows. He wonders if they’re still going. But it’s almost been ten years, so he doubts it.)
Hoseok turns it on, if only for the background noise. It stays on until they’re ready for bed, filling the room with comfortable noise.
---
Namjoon’s beginning to suspect that Hoseok doesn’t like quiet. He would never ask, but he has his assumptions.
---
Hoseok wasn’t going to leave Namjoon to sleep in the living room alone, so he’s pushed the coffee table to the side and worked his magic on the folding couch.
Namjoon remembers these being popular when he was a kid.
He hasn’t seen one in a while.
Then again, he doesn’t have a couch.
---
Once the both of them are settled in, curled under blanket mounds and with comfy pillows tucked under their heads, Hoseok brings it up.
“You don’t have to keep putting the pillow back on my chair, you know.”
He’s not facing Namjoon, but he doesn’t have to be to know the other has stiffened. Has pulled in a tight breath.
“You don’t even have to keep all your things in the locker. The clothes are going to get all wrinkly and what’s even the point of washing them then?” Hoseok’s mouth is twisted into an unhappy shape.
Namjoon’s is a tight line.
Neither are looking at the other. Their backs curve in identical arches, facing opposite directions.
“All I’m saying is--is if that’s where you want to stay, I won’t stop you. I get it. Not everyone has an easy time,” a shift. Just a small one. Hoseok doesn’t want to upset the delicate balance he’s created in the bed. “I didn’t, for a long while. I struggled. Lived on the streets for a few months after college. Bounced from friends to friends after that.” Hoseok pulls in a careful breath.
“When I finally got a place of my own, I almost got evicted a lot just trying to make ends meet. Got hooked on pills for a time--it’s why Taehyung and I stopped seeing each other. I can’t blame him. I wouldn’t want to date me back then either,” a pause, “But I made it and I’m fine now. I’m better. I found my way and things got better.”
Namjoon pushes out a breath. Hoseok didn’t realize he’d been holding it in. He doesn’t realize he’s barely breathing himself.
“And I mean it. About the office thing. The locker thing. You can just keep everything in the office. There’s less of a chance of it all being taken that way.”
Hoseok doesn’t get a response, but he didn’t expect one.
If he didn’t know better, he’d have thought Namjoon had fallen asleep.
---
Namjoon hadn’t and, in fact, he barely got any sleep that night at all.
---
The next morning, Namjoon is gone before Hoseok wakes up. There’s a note thanking him for dinner and the pajamas that are folded under the paper. He apologizes for getting sick and needing to spend the night.
Hoseok almost doesn’t expect to see Namjoon at the studio again.
---
Surprisingly though, he does. And the next morning, Hoseok goes into his office to find the thin blankets folded and piled carefully in the corner, sitting under the pillow and the duffel bag.
---
That night, Namjoon arrives to find his blankets and duffel missing. They’ve been replaced with new ones.
The clothes in the new duffel bag are different as well. All new. Sweaters that will fit and keep him warm, T-shirts and jeans without holes.
Matching socks.
Hoseok leans on the doorframe, watching as Namjoon cautiously picks through everything. He’s taking a count on what’s there.
“I didn’t throw any of it out, if that’s what you’re worried about. I didn’t know if you were attached to--.”
“I wasn’t. I’m not,” it’s choked out. The words are thick over a heavy tongue. Namjoon pulls in a wet breath and doesn’t turn around. Hoseok doesn’t approach.
“I don’t know what I can do to help.”
“You’ve done enough. It’s--it’s just too much right now. I need a minute. Maybe more.”
Hoseok’s lips purse. Of course it’s too much. He’s done it again.
But Hoseok manages a nod, even though Namjoon can’t see it. “Alright. Let me know if there’s anything else. I’ll keep the heat a little higher in the office tonight. If it’s too hot, tell me tomorrow and we’ll adjust it until it’s perfect for you. I don't want to freeze you out, but I don’t think you’d appreciate the Sahara either.”
---
This continues for a long while. Eventually, Namjoon gets new shoes. New gloves. A new hat and scarf. An actual new coat. There are tags he has to remove and throw away.
The things amass slowly, but surely.
---
Namjoon turns twenty-six at the studio. Hoseok is there. He’s packing Namjoon’s things into the backseat of Yoongi’s car. Jungkook, bless his heart, is trying to help, but his booster seat and buckle aren’t letting him get far. Still, he leans and stretches and reaches, trying to pull on the blankets to get them further from the opposite door, his chubby fingers grasping hard and arms straining to tug.
It’s way past his bedtime.
Yoongi is chiding the child from the driver’s seat.
He refused to get out and help. It’s too chilly at night and he has to keep the car running for Jungkook’s sake. The child is small and unable to properly regulate his body heat, even in the multiple layers he wears at all times during this time of year. Or at least that’s what Jimin explained once.
(Seokjin and Yoongi are almost positive Jimin lied about that. They’re sure he only said it to see Jungkook bundled up tight and puffy in layer after layer.)
(But there is no evidence for this case other than Jimin himself, and he’s not talking.)
Namjoon brings the last of his things. It only took them three trips--Namjoon, Hoseok, and Namjoon again--to get everything out of the dance studio.
“Thanks again, Hyung. I’d have done it myself, but my car is in the shop and, you know,” Hoseok shrugs. Yoongi scowls.
“Don’t mention it,” a pause. “No, seriously don’t mention it. I don’t want to hear you talk about this again.” Yoongi snorts.
Jungkook imitates the sound. He’s spot on, and even his expression is nearly a perfect mirror of his father’s.
Hoseok teases the child for a moment, making faces and waggling his fingers around, but then Yoongi’s speaking once more.
“I’m not organizing this shit when I get there. It’s getting dropped off in the front room and that’s all I’m doing. I’ll leave the key under the mat or something. You’ll find it eventually, I’m sure.”
---
“Shit,” Jungkook repeats loudly. He looks proud. It’s a new word. Everyone is always proud of him when he learns a new word. His hands grip into fists and he beams at the front seat and his father.
“Look what you made me do, Hoseok!” Yoongi is almost whining, but he’s really just angry at himself. “They’re all going to kill me. We decided we didn’t want him to swear until he was at least seven.”
Hoseok laughs.
Jungkook laughs back, grinning and bouncing in his booster seat.
Namjoon manages a smile, but he’s pretty distant at the moment.
---
The walk to Hoseok’s apartment is sobering.
---
“Ten years ago, I told my parents I was gay.”
“Oh?”
“Yeah.”
“Are you still gay?”
Namjoon shoots him an incredulous look.
“What?” Hoseok sounds offended. “I’m just checking! I need to know if have a chance!”
Namjoon punches his arm and laughs.
---
Namjoon sleeps on the fold-away couch until partway through December. Then Hoseok insists on putting up a tree, and even though it’s small, it takes up too much room for the bed to be pulled out properly. Namjoon has to relocate to Hoseok’s room.
They’ve shared a bed before. And it’s only temporary after all.
---
Even after the tree comes down (well into January, mind you), Namjoon still curls up in the bedroom to sleep. Hoseok makes the best big spoon.
---
“I thought I was going to die, you know? Back then. Right after it happened.”
Hoseok hums, but doesn’t respond. His fingers feather touches across the tops of Namjoon’s bare thighs. Now that Namjoon has new clothes, he’s back to wearing briefs as opposed to boxers. He prefers them and now he gets to make a fashion choice as opposed to a survival one.
It’s summer and it’s hot. He’s not going to put pants on if he’s not leaving the apartment.
(He wouldn’t have even left the bed if Hoseok hadn’t proposed a date with some ice cubes. Namjoon didn’t want the bed getting wet, so he’d agreed to a change in scenery. Anything was worth getting to crunch down on frozen water in heat like this.)
Hoseok’s apartment building has a few problems with the air conditioning unit.
The two of them are stripped down to underwear and tank tops for the time being.
It’s almost too hot to do anything other than lay on top of blankets on the floor in the living room, slowly working through another cup of ice.
But Hoseok has his hands and fingers on Namjoon’s thighs and his head on Namjoon’s stomach. It’s no longer skin and bones.
He’s no longer skin and bones.
(It’s also not salt and sausage and ramen. Now it’s carrot sticks and fruit cups and, sometimes, whatever Seokjin brings when he’s irritated that Hoseok never cooks.)
(He’d never blame Namjoon for not cooking. He thinks the man is an absolute darling. Taehyung and Jimin are both sick of hearing Seokjin talk about Namjoon. Joonie this and Joonie that. Ugg. Once, they suggest Seokjin just date Namjoon if he loves him so goddamn much. Seokjin seems to actually consider it, but only for a moment. Jungkook starts asking what ‘dating’ is and that’s a bullet they try to dodge as delicately as possible.)
It’s just too hot for this kind of touching, but Namjoon doesn’t push Hoseok away.
Instead, he curls some of his fingers into Hoseok’s sweat-matted hair. For a moment, he thinks that it should be gross. It should be disgusting.
But this must be love.
Accepting the sweat involved.
---
If Namjoon would brave a desert for anyone, it would be Hoseok.
Nothing would ever be too much where Hoseok was concerned.



Chapter End Notes
Um, yes. Jimin, Seokjin, Taehyung, and Yoongi maybe might be in a fourway relationship?? And they may also all be helping to raise Yoongi's son, Jungkook.I don't know. It seemed fun at the time.
The Book Thief by Markus Zusak is my favorite book. I’ve read it once a year, every year for 10 years. I cry seven times each read through and the pages are distorted because they get wet.This is not an exaggeration. I have water warped a book by crying on it for 10 years. This is my life.Whatever the case, it stars Death who has an inability to understand people because we are both cruel and kind. It’s more complex, but I won’t explain here. Feel free to ask though, if you want to know more. It’s about 550 pages and a young adult novel. And so, so worth the read.
I think this one is one of my favorite chapters? I don’t know I just really like Hoseok.Also tiny Jungkook is the best and, my god, I could write small children all day I really could just watch me.

Chapter Notes
This chapter had the least amounts of edits in it. What you have here is, more or less, the first draft (with spelling/grammar corrections as I found them through read throughs, though it may not be perfect). I guess I was pretty happy with the original writing, though I do have some complaints about myself at the end.This is also the first that differs from what has become the typical format for the previous chapters.So that's exciting. I think.Fair warning though. It gets a little heavy as far as sexual talking goes. Whoops.

        See the end of the chapter for more notes




Namjoon did get the job. It wasn’t anything spectacular. Just a regular coffee shop situation. Taking orders, working a register, making drinks.
He messed up one order for every three he made. But most people were out the door before taking a drink and it was usually too much work and too busy inside to bother going back in to fix his mistakes.
Small miracles.
He worked there until just after Christmas. The manager caught him taking home pastries instead of throwing them out and had to fire him for it.
The manager apologized. But there’s nothing she could do. It’s company rules and company policy.
Namjoon said he understood.
---
He certainly does not understand.
If they’re just going to go in the trash anyway, why can’t he take them? He understands maybe not taking a lot, but--but it was just a couple of croissants! What was he going to do? Sell them on the black market?
Namjoon doesn’t get it. He doesn’t think he ever will.
---
It takes a few more attempts, but he does get another job. A florist shop. He doesn’t know much about plants, despite his previous experience at a florists, but he starts reading up on them in the library. Learns the language of flowers. Would never sell someone a single daffodil.
Would never lie to someone about the meaning of yellow carnations.
He learns when to pluck dead heads and when it’s necessary to cut back stems and shoots to make the plant grow bigger.
In the end, it’s not enough.
---
(In the end, it’s never enough.)
---
He trips on a hose in the greenhouse and knocks over an entire shelf of terracotta flower pots.
Namjoon is let go and he understands.
People make mistakes and, sometimes, those mistakes aren’t easy to let slide.
It’s not something he’s not used to.
---
Namjoon bounces around more jobs that summer. Does some temporary heavy lifting work for a local fair. Runs a carnival game when it comes to town and pockets a few bills every now and again. Assists at a gas station washing cars.
But none of the positions are permanent.
Namjoon pickpockets when he runs out of money and jobs in the immediate area. It’s pretty easy in the warmer months--people wear fewer clothes, so there are fewer pockets to search. He doesn’t take more than he needs. Steals a wallet here or there and stops when he’s able to pay his rent and buy a box of crackers or a jar of peanut butter. He still has morals.
But as winter approaches and layers of clothing start getting added, stealing wallets becomes more and more difficult.
---
Namjoon turns twenty-three in the library. He grabs the same book on cake decorating.
The spine cracks when he picks it up and a couple of pages fall out.
He glances around to make sure none of the women are watching him.
Namjoon folds the yellow pages and tucks them into his empty wallet without looking at the words.
The books gets reshelved and he leaves early.
---
The wallet had been a gift from his father when he turned sixteen. He thought about that bitterly sometimes. Imagined going back to his old house and throwing it at the man before walking away.
He’d stolen enough wallets that he could have his pick of a new one.
But this one was a good memory.
So he kept it.
---
And, to be honest, Namjoon wasn’t at all positive he remembered where his home had been. He could, sometimes, picture the street, but it looked as it did when he was walking it for the last time.
Cold and alone and scared, clutching a duffel bag and a small sum of money in his shaking hands.
He could, sometimes, picture the walls with their crisp white paint their family photos their clinical feel.
He could, sometimes, picture his old bedroom. Pale blue walls and white ceiling. He’d always wanted glow in the dark stars, but his parents had refused. Instead, he had bookshelves upon bookshelves and books upon books upon books.
---
It was really no surprise he had found solace in the pages of the library, finding himself time and time again in rows upon rows upon rows and the silent written words.
---
Namjoon didn’t look to see what pages had fallen out of his book (because, really, he felt as though it were his by this point) until he got back to his apartment. And, even then, he waited until morning.
He didn’t want to turn the lights on and use electricity.
He wasn’t even positive the lightbulbs worked anymore.
Whatever the case, the pages tell him how to create frosting flowers. Namjoon laughs.
He’s always been a sucker for irony.
He reads the instructions over a million times by the light of the sun, keeping himself by the window, but not opening it. The air is chilly outside and he doesn't want to deal with it.
By the time he’s done, he’s pretty sure he could create roses and carnations and lilies in multiple ways. The instructions on daffodils got cut off. They’re still in the book.
Namjoon thinks about going back and stealing it, but he feels bad enough for taking the three pages he already has in his possession.
---
Winter hits. It’s mild at first. Namjoon doesn’t have a job yet. He struggles to steal wallets. Once, he bundles up as much as he can and steals one of the Santa pails. It’s dark out so no one can really chase him down. He feels terrible for doing it.
But the money was going to a company that disliked people like him anyway. Why shouldn’t he benefit from it?
Or at least that was how he tried to reason it out.
He felt sick to his stomach, but there was nothing to throw up but sour-tasting bile. He tosses the red pail into the dumpster after emptying it. Pocketed all the cash and coins and jogged back to his apartment.
---
Namjoon manages to find work before December ends. It’s at a Christmas Tree farm, helping to tie the evergreens to rooves or wagons. He gets everything as situated as possible and collects payment.
He works on commission, so the more he sells, the more he gets.
After Christmas, he works for an electronics store. He knows enough to get by.
---
The job is gone just as the weather turns for the worse.
Namjoon can’t pay his rent for January.
The landlord doesn’t have anyone rushing to get in, so he says if Namjoon can pay for two months in February, he’ll be allowed to stay for January.
The man knows it’s a bad idea. Namjoon’s never been steady.
But he takes the risk because Namjoon is young and struggling and kind.
The landlord has seen him help the elderly woman on the third floor up the stairs when the timing is right for them both. The elevator in the building hasn’t worked since before Namjoon moved in.
---
Namjoon’s on the streets with his duffel bag over his shoulders on February first. It’s a cold day, so he goes to the library.
He can’t stay the night there.
Namjoon finds himself at a shelter for the next three weeks.
It’s warm and he gets a full meal and a little bit of extra bread.
But the longer he stays, the more suspicious the workers grow--they don’t like it when people don’t have jobs or don’t seem to be looking for them.
There’s just no one in the area that will hire him.
Word has traveled fast and far. Friends of friends of friends discussing bad employees and realizing they are all describing the same man.
Namjoon hates it.
He’s always tried so hard to be good.
He tries so hard.
---
Namjoon leaves the shelter. He packs his things and takes a few bread rolls and just goes. He hits the streets and tries to find a place to settle in.
Seoul is very against homelessness. They don’t really want to do anything about it, but with how the city looks, it’s almost illegal to be living on the streets. The last thing Namjoon needs is to be arrested.
Though the jail would have food and shelter.
Namjoon gets rid of those thoughts quickly enough. 
He doesn't need that in his life.
He's got enough problems without having a criminal record.
---
The trainyard is alright though. There are a few abandoned cars there, and Namjoon finds one that doesn't look too bad. It’s cleaner than most and appears to have fewer drafty holes than the others nearby.
Namjoon pulls himself up and in and closes the door. It’s pitch black inside, but he tries to flip the inside latch anyway.
That first night, he shivers in his sleep. He curls under all his blankets and wears all his clothes. His coat is old and short on his arms. His pants don’t fit quite right.
So he shivers. He wakes up cold and with his fingers and toes stiff and hard to move, cracking as he tries.
---
But he wakes up.
He has ten fingers.
He has ten toes.
He woke up.
And that’s good enough for him today.
---
That turned out to be the coldest day of the entire winter. He managed to survive it.
He walks to the city every day to steal, apply for jobs, and spend time at the library. It’s cold each time, but he goes.
He doesn’t have a choice.
---
It’s part way through summer when he gets a position. He’s skinnier now, as if he had weight to lose. His face is thin and his eyes deep set, now. Fingers bony and elbows pointed and poking if run into.
But Namjoon doesn’t need to worry too much. His job is loading and unloading trucks at a shipping center. He’s not in the public eye.
It’s hard to do the work. He’s not strong in the slightest. He can’t be, when he’s all skin and bones.
He can afford food for the summer and into the fall.
---
In the spring, the flowers bloom. Bright yellow and white daffodils. Some are orange, but it’s a strange mutation in their genes. He doesn’t like the orange ones as much. The color isn’t as soft as it should be.
Hyacinths and tulips come up, but nothing compares to daffodils.
He stops to smell them a few times. Always makes sure to do it in pairs at the very least. He doesn’t need any single daffodils in his life. He’s got enough to deal with as it is.
---
Namjoon knows his job won’t last forever. The week before his birthday, he’s fired. He doesn’t know why and he doesn’t ask. Probably personnel cuts. Seniority stays, fresh meat leaves.
So Namjoon is gone.
---
Namjoon turns twenty-four on the streets. It’s midnight and he’s stooped low enough to take a few thousand from a strange man in an alley. He’d promised himself he’d never do this. That he’d never get this far from himself. (Or, at the very least, who he believed he’d be.)
This was not what he wanted.
This was not what he wanted at all.
---
Namjoon turns twenty-four with a strangers dick in his mouth. It’s the first time he’s touched another man in this kind of way, other than kissing.
But there was no kissing involved.
At least there was a condom.
He doesn’t know what he’d do if there hadn’t been.
---
Namjoon stumbles from the alley, wiping spit off his lips and mouth with the back of his hand. He gagged more times than he could count. His throat is raw. His lips are plush and plump and red. His eyes are wet and still sting from discomfort and pain.
But he’s got enough cash on him to buy himself a box of crackers, a jar of peanut butter, and a case of water. Maybe even another scarf for the fast approaching winter.
---
Namjoon spends the rest of the day in the library. He tries to find the book on cake decorating. When he can’t, he asks the library women.
They apologize, but the book had been damaged beyond their ability to repair.
They threw it out almost a year ago.
Namjoon thanks them, but he leaves.
He doesn’t really plan to come back.
---
He finds his way back to the alley. There’s no one there, but across the street is a guy who looks like he’d pay for some fun.
---
Namjoon’s throat is, perhaps, more raw than he thought it could be.
He can’t say he feels better about the whole thing, but he doesn’t feel any worse.
---
He tries to keep thinking that.
---
Winter comes.
As do a lot of men when Namjoon is involved. Sometimes Namjoon feels a little warmer when the men finish. It’s a bitter taste of heat and it doesn’t last long when he throws up after they’ve rounded the corner.
But Namjoon’s got a small store of cash to his name.
He still sleeps in the train car. Carries his duffel bag with him most days, but leaves the blankets. They’re harder to carry around, so he’s cutting his losses if they get stolen.
They never do.
---
That doesn’t mean Namjoon isn’t in danger of having things stolen from him.
---
Namjoon is twenty-four and it’s the beginning of the end of January. He tried to keep track of the date a long time ago, but now he just get references from clocks on the banks he passes when he’s out and about. All he knows is that it’s cold. It’s always cold. He’s always cold.
He’s bundled himself up in his coat and most of his sweaters. His duffel bag is around his back, the strap tied against his chest.
The strap snapped a while back. He’d kept it tied together so he can still wear it.
---
Namjoon expects a lot of things. The cold for sure. To be yelled at. To be bumped into. To have a stranger press deep into his throat and yank his hair. To gag and spit and try very hard not to swallow reflexively.
He doesn’t expect to be grabbed harshly and pulled down and into an alley.
It’s getting dark and it’s cold.
---
It’s always cold.
---
And Namjoon is terrified.
---
He makes every attempt to get away, but there’s more of them than there are of him.
And Namjoon is skin and bones and layers of threadbare clothes.
They take some of his layers. He makes it as difficult as he can, writhing and scrabbling and trying to shout. Trying to scream.
But his throat is much too raw for that now.
Last night was a good night for getting cash.
---
They take his duffel bag. They take his coat. They take everything but a few layers of clothes and his shoes.
They take his wallet. One of his attackers takes a peek inside. He’s impressed with the amount he finds, but gets curious at the folded yellow pages, so he pulls them out.
He scoffs and balls them up, tossing the instructions on icing flowers into the dirty slush.
“Fucking faggot,” and he leaves with the group.
They take all the money Namjoon had earned over the last few nights. The last few weeks.
They take all the money that made Namjoon’s thoat too raw to scream for help.
They take his icing flowers.
---
Namjoon lays in the alley for a while. He’s watching the slushy, dirty snow turn red and the book pages soak up soiled water from the trampled mess around him. He’s trying to even his breathing out, but every breath hurts. He’s sore and he’s hurting.
And he’s cold.
When he sits up, he expects to be alone.
---
Instead, he meets caramel eyes at the end of the alley.
Caramel eyes and a black coat.
Caramel eyes and a black coat and a hat and scarf and gloves the color of daffodils.
---
Jimin didn’t quite know what to make of it at first. He was just walking home. His shift was over--his long shift was over. Finally. All he wanted was to go home and settle into a bath. Maybe use one of those bath bombs he stole from his friends apartment.
Yoongi had certainly been mad.
But even just using one had been worth the months long cold shoulder. (That, even now, was still on the mend.)
And he’d stolen five.
But now?
Now, he didn’t have a chance of anything other than what was in front of him.
---
“Are you okay?” quiet. He approached cautiously. The man seemed pretty dazed. He was shivering, too. His clothes looked soaked through.
How long had he been sitting out here?
Street lights illuminate the world around them in the color of springtime daffodils.
Namjoon swallows. He tastes blood. The action hurts his chest. Somehow. He’s not quite sure what his chest has to do with swallowing. Perhaps he’ll read a book about it, one day.
“What happened?” Jimin pauses a few feet away, brows knit together.
Namjoon swallows again. This time, he gags on the taste of blood. Lurches to one side to throw up.
Jimin’s on him in half a second, throwing his caution to the bitterly cold wind that threatens to cut through his coat. He’s crouching in the dirty, red and grey slush, one hand holding onto a shaking arm and the other pressed to the small of a quivering back.
Both places are cold and wet.
When it seems the stranger has settled, Jimin removes his arms and looks at where the puke should be. It’s just shiny, clear bile mixed with a slight amount of blood.
Jimin swallows. Attempts to smile.
“Okay, so--so, I’m Nurse Park. You can call me Jimin,” he wets his lips. “Can I help you?”
---
Namjoon doesn’t know what makes him agree.
Maybe it’s the smile, even if it doesn’t reach the other’s eyes.
Maybe it’s the daffodils.
But Namjoon nods. He lets the other help him to his feet.
Jimin is too busy to be concerned with Namjoon’s weight, let alone make a point to think about it.
“Do you live close by?”
Namjoon swallows. Gags again. He turns his head to spit. His neck is stiff and it hurts. Hopefully Jimin can fix that.
“No. Train yard,” he manages. His voice is rough.
“Ahh, I’ve been that way. A lot of nice houses! And do you--.”
“No,” Namjoon interrupts. He doesn’t have the energy to be embarrassed right now. “I live on the train yard. In an abandoned car.” His throat still hurts. Talking hurts. Everything hurts.
Jimin quiets. Then nods, though it’s a bit hesitant. “My place is closer, than. Come on, Stranger. Let’s get you patched up.”
---
Namjoon has to support his own weight for a few seconds when Jimin crouches down. He doesn’t know what the nurse is doing in the snow, but he can’t focus well enough to even begin to care.
---
The man might not have a wallet on him. Jimin can’t be sure. He doesn’t know what the fragile wet paper in the snow is, but it might be important. It might be some form of identification.
He decides to look into it when he gets everything settled.
---
Jimin typically takes the stairs to his apartment. He likes the cardio, even if he spends all day on his feet.
But they take the elevator.
Jimin isn’t sure the man could handle more steps.
---
He’s pretty positive it would kill him.
---
“What’s your name?” Jimin’s rustling around in the bathroom cabinets. He’s pulling things out that Namjoon hasn’t seen in awhile.
Antiseptic. Iodine. Gauze. Bandaids. Neosporin. Cotton balls. Rubber gloves.
Namjoon tries to speak, but it gets caught in his throat. He coughs once, then twice. It rattles up his chest from deep in his lungs. Jimin pauses, glancing over and looking relatively concerned.
He pulls a thermometer out of the cabinet as well.
Namjoon tries again, shifting his weight from his perch on the toilet seat. His voice is croaky and rough, just as it had been outside.
But Jimin understands well enough.
“Kim Namjoon? That’s a good name, Namjoon-ssi,” a smile. He shifts. “Could you undress for me? I promise I’m a nurse.” Jimin gestures down to the scrubs he’s still wearing from his shift.
Namjoon hesitates. He watches the opposite wall.
---
The bathroom is small. Not uncomfortable for the two of them, but small.
Namjoon’s limbs are long.
He struggles to work his leftover layers off, hissing and squinting in pain.
The squinting causes more pain, as the bruised eyes and cheeks stain his skin a nasty black and blue and red.
Jimin stops him with a small sound and reaches to help, carefully leading Namjoon to keep his arms above his head as the sweaters and t-shirts are pulled off one by one. Two sweaters and three shirts later, and Namjoon is topless in Jimin’s bathroom.
There’s a sharp intake of breath at the sight.
---
Fresh bruises litter the skin. Some large and some small. From the look at some of them, Jimin can tell the ribs are going to be bruised underneath the awful discoloration. There are scratches and bleeding scrapes and almost boot prints from when he’d been tossed and trounced and kicked into hard objects in the alley.
But Jimin is more surprised at the sheer lack of man in front of him.
Namjoon’s money mostly goes to food. But healthy food is expensive. And when there are sweaters to buy and socks to replace and an apartment to save up for, Namjoon doesn’t have the ability to eat healthy food.
So he lives off of salty ramen and overly-processed meats and chips and chocolate.
But even so, Namjoon’s still so thin. Life on the streets is hard and taxing on a body.
Jimin has never seen someone like this. At least not to this extreme. Not this close. He can’t stop himself from reaching and trailing his fingers over the evident ribs. Each are pronounced, offset from the skin by the red and black and purple bloomed across them.
He swallows and pulls his hand away from Namjoon when the other shivers.
“Bottoms, too. Leave on your boxers, but I need to check your legs for abrasions as well. Don’t be embarrassed either--I’ve seen people our age, below, and older in worse shape,” not quite worse shape, really. But Namjoon doesn’t need to know.
“There’s nothing to worry about,” Jimin waves it off and turns away, working to collect everything he needs on the edge of the sink and give Namjoon some semblance of privacy.
He forces himself not to look over, despite all the pained, uncomfortable noises Namjoon makes in the process of undressing.
Once Namjoon settles back down, Jimin starts the examination.
---
“Open. Bite down; keep it under your tongue. Don’t move it around.”
Namjoon complies.
Jimin starts to check wounds. Cleans them and dresses them with bandages and gauze. When the thermometer beats, Jimin pulls it out to inspect, tutting at the temperature he finds there. It’s not too hot--a degree or two higher than normal. It doesn’t really account for the roughness of Namjoon’s voice, but perhaps he had been screaming recently.
Certainly not when he was attacked. Jimin would have heard.
When he’s satisfied with cleaning up the wounds, Jimin has Namjoon open his mouth. He shines the light of his phone inside, checking to see what’s going on. “Your throat’s all swollen,” the man tuts again, pulling back and making an unhappy face. “But you’re not running a temperature.”
Jimin rolls and bounces on the balls of his feet. He thinks for a few moments before shaking his head. “I’m going to put you on bed rest for a few days, Namjoon-ssi.”
He shakes his head again when Namjoon starts talking. “I know. I remember. But you can use my couch. You’re my patient now, and I’ve got the weekend off and nowhere to go,” he smiles, starting to put everything away and remove the rubber gloves.
“You’ll be staying here with me.”
---
Namjoon doesn’t know what he did to deserve this.
The couch is soft--almost unbearably so--and the apartment is warm. By the end of the night, he can tell he’s getting a cold from sitting in the snow for so long. Jimin won’t like it when he realizes, but Namjoon will let him treat it.
As it is, he’s comfortable.
And he has a bowl of chicken noodle soup.
---
Okay, so it’s chicken broth. But it’s warm and it’s soothing on his throat. Following the broth, Jimin brings him a cup of lukewarm tea mixed with honey.
Namjoon doesn’t remember falling asleep. He doesn’t remember a blanket being laid over him carefully. He doesn’t remember Jimin slipping out of the apartment.
He doesn't remember Jimin returning with a stolen IV bag and supplies needed for it.
He doesn’t remember the needle going in, though he’s sure he would have woken up for it.
---
But Namjoon wakes up feeling pretty good about a lot of things.
He’s warm. He’s comfortable. His throat still hurts a little, but it’s not unbearable.
He doesn’t feel much pain otherwise, which is strange. He expected more.
Jimin’s moving beside him and Namjoon startles for a moment. He’d forgotten about the other man. His sharp, sudden movement brings Jimin’s attention closer to him, and the nurse smiles. It crinkles his eyes and Namjoon’s brows go up slightly.
“I, uh. I went to the hospital and nicked some IV’s. It’s simple pain medicine. I mean--I could get in big trouble for it, but,” a pause. When he continues, it’s in a loud whisper, as though he’s sharing a secret with Namjoon and only Namjoon. “My dad owns the place. He’ll keep it hush hush if I get found out,” Jimin smiles carefully, his eyes not curving as much, and goes back to changing the bag.
“I’d hoped that you weren’t allergic to any medicines. But on the off chance, I got the most common kind. You seemed to be doing fine all last night, so I don’t think it’s a problem.”
Namjoon frowns. “....why are you doing this?” He’s hesitant to ask. If Jimin tries to find an answer and can’t, Namjoon could find himself back on the streets without another thought.
But Jimin looks over, tapping the bag lightly once he’s got it in the appropriate place. “There’s something about you. I don’t know what it is,” he shifts. “And, besides. You needed the help. And I doubt you have medical insurance, right?”
Namjoon flushes and looks away.
“That’s what I thought, Mister Train Car,” a smile in the voice, but Namjoon doesn’t look back to see if it’s in his eyes as well.
---
Jimin changes Namjoon’s dressings later that day. But not before a bath.
The water is nice and hot, but not scalding.
It’s also a milky blue color. Namjoon isn’t sure how, but it is.
When he sinks into the tub--Jimin has his back to him, but he’s not going to leave him alone--Namjoon sighs, clearly content with how this feels.
Namjoon plans to soak, but Jimin has other ideas. He produces a washcloth and a cup from the linen closet, ready to pour water over Namjoon’s head.
---
Jimin bathes Namjoon like a child. He doesn’t wash his groin, though, leaving that to Namjoon. He’s in the tub long enough for the water to turn tepid, then room temperature. For his fingers to wrinkle considerably. Jimin’s clearly pleased with the outcome of the bath and moves to get a towel, leaving it folded on the sink for Namjoon, along with some clothes.
“Dry off and just pull the boxers on. They’re mine, but they’re new. I’m sure they’ll fit. When you’re done, call me in so I can fix your dressings.”
And Namjoon does as told.
And Jimin does as he said he would.
---
Dinner that night is white rice and some kind of tasty, marinated chicken.
Namjoon has never had anything so good.
---
Jimin gives him some oral medicine for the pain and checks his temperature again before the night is over. He brings out a few extra blankets to pile on and keep him warm.
“If you need anything, there’s water in the fridge,” a small gesture to the kitchen, “and the bathroom’s down that way, as you know. And my bedroom is right through that door,” Jimin points, bouncing on the balls of his feet for a moment.
Namjoon can’t help but notice how different he looks outside of the scrubs he had on the day before. Basketball shorts and a tank top, both loose and hanging.
He swallows and nods.
“Thank you. You don’t have to do this, but thank you.”
Jimin shrugs. “I’m a nurse. It’s my job to help people.”
---
Namjoon doesn’t question it after that. His bruises go from red-black to black-blue. Some new ones show up, but Jimin declares that normal and tells him nothing is wrong. Namjoon is still achy and sore, but there’s not much he can do for it past oral pain medication. He’s past the need for intravenous solutions.
After a week, he asks Jimin if when he’s expected to leave.
“When you’re healthy and healed,” Jimin glances back from the stove, stirring the pot a little more. Seaweed soup. Namjoon hasn't had that since he was a teenager. Since he was at his parents house.
It’s crazy to think about.
So he stops doing that.
---
Another week, and Namjoon’s lost his limp. Jimin’s brought him some clothes from the hospital to wear in place of his threadbare sweaters and stained jeans, which he then throws out.
He brightens up the apartment with a vase full of flowers. Red amaryllis and stark white roses that compliment each other, but not the space they’re put in. The vase is old and the color of daffodils, so it offsets the flowers inside. Jimin tells Namjoon it belonged to his grandmother and used to be white.
But Namjoon doesn’t complain.
Even after all of this, he likes the thought of the flowers. They’re pretty, but the moment you collect them, they begin to die.
---
For the first time, he wonders about the icing flower pages.
It’s only for a second, but it’s long enough for him to frown.
---
Later that day, he pets along the petals of the flowers, mumbling about how he’s sorry they've become victims of the passage of time.
---
It’s almost the end of February. Jimin still insists Namjoon stay. The worst of his bruises are yellow and green in places. The best are gone completely. The cuts no longer need bandages or gauze. He doesn’t limp. Breathing doesn’t hurt.
Namjoon thinks he’s healthy enough. He didn’t get sick, his throat isn’t sore anymore.
He’s fine.
But Jimin says that he’s not. And Jimin is a nurse.
The scrubs and bedside manner make that very clear.
But he must not be a very intelligent nurse--he leaves Namjoon alone in his apartment all day. Namjoon could just take his things. Steal his expensive ones and sell them.
He won’t.
But he could.
And Jimin doesn’t know him that well.
---
Namjoon doesn’t steal anything but space and energy and food.
He sleeps on the couch and eats and takes showers.
Heals up more and more each day.
---
“Why am I still here, Jimin?”
Jimin glances up from his plate. They’re having take-out from a Chinese place a block and a half down. It’s Jimin’s favorite place. Namjoon knows this somehow. He’s just not sure how.
Jimin shrugs. He doesn’t look at the way the clothing still hangs on Namjoon’s long frame or the darkness lurking in his eyes.
“You’re not healthy yet, Hyung.”
---
Namjoon thinks he’s pretty healthy. Which is why, when the weather breaks and spring settles in close to the end of April, he shucks on one of Jimin’s coats and leaves.
It’s a thin fleece. Not meant to be used in place of a winter coat. But it’s barely winter at the moment and, sure he’s a little chilly, but not unbearably so.
So he leaves. Hits the streets once more and glances at every help-wanted sign he sees. Namjoon pops into a few places--it’s been a while. Maybe someone will take him in.
Namjoon doesn’t have any resumes with him--he used to print them from the library. He hasn’t been there since before he sunk low enough to bury his knees in snow and dicks in his throat--but he can list off the relevant previous jobs and experience.
---
The cafe isn’t as far from Jimin’s apartment as he’d have liked, but it’ll hire him to clean.
He explains that he doesn’t have the money to buy the clothes needed for the uniform and gets a slight advance on the first pay check.
Namjoon comes in the next day with black jeans and a dark polo. They’re not new, but the thrift store had some decent looking used clothes.
---
It’s hard to walk past alleys at night.
It’s hard to walk past alleys in the day.
---
Namjoon gets fired after a month. But flowers are starting to bloom in small plots across the city.
The day after the first big rainstorm of the season, he spends the entire day and night in a park. He feels the soft petals of tulips and plucks flowers from a hyacinth stem.
He spends most of his time looking for yellow daffodils. All the ones he finds are white or impossibly, irritatingly orange.
Namjoon isn’t impressed.
---
Namjoon turns twenty-five in the fall. He’s gotten over his fear of alleys if only because business is better suited there than on the sidewalks.
His lips are red and swollen. His throat is sore and scratchy. His tongue feels heavy on the bottom of his mouth.
But he’s got money in his pocket. Not enough for what he wants, but that’s easily fixed.
There are a lot of men out at night.
There are a lot of men out at night who need someone to drop to their knees and part their lips and take.
---
Winter is just starting the next time he and Jimin see each other again. It’s the night of the first snow. White powders dusts most surfaces, barely laying. It will be gone before mid morning the next day.
---
Jimin finds Namjoon in an alley.
---
This time, Namjoon seems more broken than he did the first time, even if there’s not a drop a blood on him. Not a single bruise to mar his skin.
But there’s a cock in his mouth and a stranger's hand fisted in his hair, tugging harshly.
And Jimin would recognize that thin fleece anywhere.
Would recognize those hosptial pants anywhere.
Those shoulders.
That hair.
Even if it’s shaggier now than it had been.
Even if it’s dark out, now, and the world is illuminated by the streetlights, coloring everything Namjoon’s favorite daffodils.
---
Jimin doesn’t approach. Just hangs around the corner, playing with the fingers on his yellow gloves.
He waits.
And he waits.
---
The stranger exits shortly after a grossly loud moan.
There’s a shuddering breath from the alley. There’s spitting. A bit of gagging and a curse.
Jimin waits a little more.
---
When he hears quiet, Jimin moves.
He turns and walks down the alley with his head up and commanding. He stops a few feet from Namjoon.
The older man turns, freezing when he sees Jimin. He’s still shorter. Still bundled in a black coat. Still wearing gloves and scarf and hat the color of daffodils.
Namjoon’s lips are swollen and red and there’s spit and something white that Jimin doesn’t want to think about on them.
---
“I told you that you had to stay until you were healthy.” The words are hard. Namjoon can hear the blatant disappointment in them.
Namjoon can’t meet his eyes, so he watches the ground. Pays attention to the brown, dead leaves there. The trees had had enough and discarded them without a second thought.
When winter was coming, the trees couldn’t afford to keep them anymore.
Namjoon kind of understands.
But winter is here, and they’re just brittle reminders that sometimes things cost too much to keep up.
---
They wind up in Jimin’s apartment again. The bath, this time, is powder pink and smells vaguely of lilacs and lavender.
Namjoon briefly wonders why it’s not purple. He doesn’t think too hard on it. Jimin’s expecting him to strip and slide into the water, and he doesn’t really want to disappoint him.
He’s done enough of that for one day.
But he doesn’t know why he cares.
---
Jimin leaves once Namjoon is settled into the water.
From the tub, he can hear Jimin on the phone.
He only gets half the conversation.
He wishes he heard the whole thing.
---
“I found him again, Hyung,” Jimin’s worried.
“That Namjoon guy?” Yoongi shifts, pushing Seokjin away slightly. He doesn’t expect Seokjin to steal his phone and put it on speaker. Certainly doesn’t expect him to wave Taehyung over from where he’s sitting at the desk across the room. There are short greetings before the actual conversation gets back underway.
“He was--god, Hyung. He was giving some stranger a blowjob for cash. In an alley. I’m sure it’s not the first time,” quieter.
(In the bathroom, Namjoon can’t hear any part of that sentence past ‘Hyung.’)
(It’s probably for the best.)
“Woah,” Taehyung adds. It’s unhelpful and Yoongi thoughtlessly pushes him away with a foot, almost sending Taehyung off the bed when the younger adds a dramatic flair to the action.
There are scowls from his elders and he settles down, resting his head on Yoongi’s bare thigh and playing his fingers at the hem of Seokjin’s unbuttoned shirt.
“Does he look better?” Seokjin asks, leaning closer to the phone that’s balanced on Yoongi’s chest. “Like--healthier?”
“No. Of course he doesn’t, Hyung. He looks just as sick--maybe more. I’m worried.”
“You don’t owe him anything.” No one expects that to come from Taehyung. But now it’s out there. “You don’t owe him anything, Jiminie. If you don’t want to deal with it, you don’t have to. Isn’t he still practically a stranger?”
“He lived with me for months, Tae. He snores like a freight train. He taught himself English from books in a library. He’s from somewhere in Seoul, I’m sure. He talked to the flowers I had in my apartment,” Jimin pauses to breathe a shake his head. “He’s nice, Taehyung. And he needs help.”
“He can’t replace Jungkook, Chim,” Taehyung again. Softer this time, but with a hard edge. He’s an odd voice of reason in this situation. “I know you’re hurting because he--.”
“I don’t need a replacement. I don’t need a project. I’m not dumb and I’m not that immature. This isn’t about Jungkook. I am an adult. I was just--I was calling to find out what to do, not to get a lecture about my inability to hold onto relationships.”
“You’re right. This is actually more of a conversation about you projecting your irritation and resentment toward Jungkook on some poor homeless guy who sucks cock in alleys.” There’s sharp bites to Taehyung’s words, but he doesn’t look sorry.
Yoongi successfully manages to get Taehyung off the bed and onto the floor that time, dramatic flair not needed.
“I think,” Yoongi continues a little more carefully, “what you need to do first is talk to him, Jiminnie. See what he wants and plans to do.” Seokjin nods along.
“Yeah. Perhaps he doesn’t want to be a charity case--.”
“That’s not what this is, Hyung!”
“Yes, yes. We know. But the point still stands, Jimin,” a sigh. Jimin doesn’t know which one of them makes the sound, but Seokjin keeps talking shortly after. “Talk to him. If he wants to stay and get better, let him. If he wants to keep living on the streets, let him. He’s an adult. You can’t control his actions.”
“I know, Hyung, but what if he dies out there and I could have done something about it?”
It’s Yoongi that sighs this time. Jimin knows, because it sounds somewhat disappointed.
“You can’t save everyone, Kid. Just try to save yourself. The world sucks like that.”
---
The conversation ends surprisingly fast after that.
---
(Taehyung had drug himself back up on the bed and was irritated that he’d been kicked off in the first place.
He showed it with a little bit of magic.
Yoongi’s dick disappeared down Taehyung’s throat.)
---
All Namjoon heard was:
“I found him again, Hyung.”
“Hello, Taehyung. Seokjin-hyung.”
“He was--god, Hyung.” More words, but they’re mumbled. Too quiet for Namjoon to make out. He tries, but the extra movement sloshes water from the tub and he feels terrible about it, so he settles down once more.
“No. Of course he doesn’t, Hyung. He looks just as sick--maybe more. I’m worried.”
“He lived with me for months, Tae. He snores like a freight train. He taught himself English from books in a library. He’s from somewhere in Seoul, I’m sure. He talked to the flowers I had in my apartment.”
A breath.
“He’s nice, Taehyung. And he needs help.”
“I don’t need a replacement.” Namjoon’s surprised at the bite in Jimin’s voice. He didn’t think it possible for the other to sound so angry.
But Namjoon’s found that he’s often wrong.
“I don’t need a project. I’m not dumb and I’m not that immature. This isn’t about Jungkook. I am an adult. I was just--I was calling to find out what to do, not to get a lecture about my inability to hold onto relationships.”
“That’s not what this is, Hyung!”
“I know, Hyung, but what if he dies out there and I could have done something about it?”
“Oh my god, Tae!” Scandalized.
Namjoon assumes Jimin hung up the phone because there’s no more talking after that.
---
Jimin gives Namjoon a few more minutes alone in the bathroom. He makes tea and adds some honey to the mix.
He knows the other’s throat is going to be sore.
---
Jimin knocks carefully. “Are you okay in there?”
“Yeah,” too quick a response. It crackles awkwardly up his throat. “I was just getting ready to get out.”
It’s another few minutes, but he exits the bathroom wearing the clothes Jimin put out for him. He’s chilly in the t-shirt and basketball shorts, but it’s mostly because he didn’t dry off well enough. The shirt clings to his damp back.
Jimin smiles, but it’s a little strained. “Hey, you--.”
“Who’s Jungkook?”
---
Namjoon could imagine shooting Jimin would have been kinder than asking that. Perhaps killing his childhood dog. Murdering his family.
Stealing the last piece of cake on his birthday.
Anything would have been kinder than asking that question, it seems.
---
They’re sitting on the couch. Jimin’s got his knees bent and his legs curled up against his chest.
He’s quiet and staring across the living room.
Namjoon can see the rise and fall of his shoulders and back with each breath, so he knows he’s alive at least.
But they’ve been sitting like this for the last ten minutes and he’s getting antsy.
---
The tea is untouched on the coffee table.
It’s cold, now.
---
“He was my boyfriend. For a long time,” Jimin doesn’t move. Namjoon startles when he speaks. He hadn’t expected it and had gotten used to the quiet.
“We were together for--for--god,” a weak laugh. Jimin turns his head to look in another direction. “For probably close to eight years? We were fourteen when we started dating--and don’t give me that look,” he doesn’t look over, but can feel the judgment.
“We were fourteen and young and stupid and together for eight years. Sort of eight years,” Jimin shifts again. “See, he--well. The second half--the last four years--he was seeing someone else, too.” A pause. “My best friend, honestly. My boyfriend of eight years cheated on me for four years with my best friend. They didn’t tell me or anything. I caught them together in my bed. All Jungkook said was ‘I thought you were coming home late today’. Hoseok couldn’t get anything out but ‘oh’.”
Namjoon wets his lips.
“That sucks,” the words come up rough. But Namjoon doesn’t mean them.
---
He gets it. He really does.
For Jimin, that’s got to be pretty shitty. To have someone he trusts throw him away like he’s nothing. To have two people he trusts and loves throw him away like he’s nothing.
It’s almost like having your parents kick you out of the house at sixteen because you thought you could trust them.
Almost.
---
“You don’t mean that.”
“No, I don’t.”
“That’s okay.”
“Yeah.”
“I’ll get you some more tea.”
“You don’t have to.”
“Your throat has to hurt. I’ll get you more tea.”
---
Namjoon doesn’t argue. He waits patiently and nurses the new mug when he gets it.
---
“I want you to stay here until you’re healthy. You need to put on weight. You’re nothing but bones right now. It’s not good. You have to know that.”
“Right.” Complacent.
“And if, after that, you want to go back out onto the streets and do what you have to to get money, then that’s what it is.”
“Right” Complacent.
“But you have to promise me you’ll start being smart and safe about it. I can get a ton of condoms for free at work. The last thing you need is an STD in your throat.”
He doesn’t add ‘or worse,’ but Namjoon assumes Jimin meant to.
---
“Right.”
---
They’re pretty quiet around each other for a week or so. Jimin feeds Namjoon the right amount each day. He doesn’t want him to throw up.
---
Namjoon does anyway. Something didn’t set well with him and Jimin decides to not serve that combination of flavors again. They don’t know what made him ill, but whatever it was, there’s a mutual, unspoken agreement to avoid it.
---
It was the crab.
---
Snow falls, sticks, and lays before there’s any talking that’s more than simple, polite conversation.
“When I was sixteen,” Namjoon starts, moving his chicken around the plate with his chopsticks, “I told my parents I was gay.”
Jimin’s chair creaks when he shifts, but he says nothing.
“That same night, they kicked me out. I hitchhiked to the middle of the city and I’ve been here ever since. I’ve bounced from job to job. I got an apartment at one point. It was shitty and cold and, honestly, more expensive than something that terrible should have been,” a weak laugh.
“But it was home,” Jimin supplies.
“It was home.”
---
Namjoon meets the other side of the phone call on Christmas. The three of them show up with a small stack of presents, all neatly and cleanly wrapped, ribbons and bows in matching colors, stylishly tied around the packages.
“I see you let Taehyung wrap them this year,” Jimin teases, helping to put them under the small tree, even if they won’t stay there for long. (Namjoon had assisted with decorating both the tree and the apartment. It had honestly been pretty fun.)
“How do you know I didn’t do it,” Seokjin argues, moving back to the door to undo his coat and scarf, hanging them on one of the vacant hooks. He toed his shoes off before walking in, not wanting to track snow and slush through the apartment, but with his hands full of packages, the rest had stayed on. Seokjin picks his shoes up to put them into a proper line next to the rest.
Jimin snorts.
“They’d be an absolute mess if you wrapped them, Hyung. And we all know Yoongi-hyung wouldn’t have bothered to wrap them. He’d have just dropped them into bags with some tissue paper.”
“Which is the most environmentally friendly way to wrap gifts, thank you very much. You can reuse the bags and tissue paper,” Yoongi wrinkles his nose and turns, watching Namjoon.
He’s politely stayed away from the group, just hunkered at the kitchen table, pretending to be reading a book Jimin had laying around.
---
Yoongi isn’t fooled for a second.
---
Namjoon doesn’t talk to them much, and it’s not from lack of trying on the part of the guests. Taehyung especially tries to strike up conversation, but Namjoon’s too intimidated by the established friendship to do much other than respond monosyllabically.
Yoongi drags Taehyung away and to the kitchen with promises of cookies before dinner, trying to be nonchalant.
---
Namjoon decides he likes Yoongi the most out of the three. There’s nothing wrong with Seokjin or Taehyung, per say. Yoongi just seems to get him.
---
Dinner is good. Seokjin keeps putting more food on Namjoon’s plate. It would be rude not to eat it, so Namjoon tries to keep up.
Jimin eventually takes Namjoon’s plate off the table. He pairs the action with a reproachful look tossed Seokjin’s way.
The oldest has the decency to look sheepish before returning to his own food.
---
What Namjoon doesn’t expect is the small stack of gifts he gets. There are four, which is more than he’s had on Christmas since he was fifteen. Three of the packages, like those for Jimin and most of the others, are wrapped neatly. The edges are crisp and the ribbons are curled and springy. The tags attached proudly display his name.
He’s not sure what to do with them at first. Opening them doesn’t seem right, but with some small and simple encouragement, he starts in on the gifts.
---
Jimin’s box (the slightly discoordinated wrap job) holds a heavy winter coat.
Yoongi got him a scarf.
Seokjin’s is a hat to match it.
Clearly, they had planned it out so everything went together. Instead of mixing colors like he was accustomed to with his clothing. They looked nice when all laid out on top of one another.
---
Taehyung’s present was the final piece--mittens. They were gaudy and clashed and, god were they ugly.
“I love them,” Namjoon manages. The words are choked. He’s feeling out the knitted fabric with clammy hands.
He sounds sincere because he is.
“Told you,” Taehyung adds, wriggling in his seat on the couch and grinning.
---
“I don’t have anything to give to you all. I’m sorry,” Namjoon’s cheeks are red in embarrassment. He can barely look at them all.
He’s not sure if it’s because he wants to keep looking at the gifts or if he just doesn’t think he could raise his head without crying.
“Just get healthy,” Seokjin supplies.
“Don’t make Jimin sad,” Taehyung adds.
Yoongi feels pressured somehow. “What they said.”
Taehyung punches his arm on the way out the door.
Namjoon hears them laughing as they move down the hall.
---
Later that night, just before bed, Jimin offers Namjoon another box. It’s wrapped less elegantly than the presents earlier had been.
Namjoon frowns.
“Jimin-ah…,” he trails off, shifting uncomfortably.
“I don’t know,” the younger starts. “Just--open it, okay? I’m going to bed. Merry Christmas, Namjoon-hyung. Don’t eat too many more cookies or you’ll throw them all up.”
He leaves before Namjoon can reply. Closes his door tightly. Namjoon won’t see him until the next morning when Jimin’s leaving for work and he wakes Namjoon up on his way out the door.
---
The gift is a set of three completely useless glass panes. They’re the perfect size. Clearly custom made.
They must have cost a small fortune.
---
Namjoon can read up on how to make roses and carnations and lilies out of frosting. The instructions for the daffodils are still cut off.
---
Namjoon stays with Jimin. He eats at the table. He sleeps on the couch. He tells Jimin more about his last eight years. More about the time he wasn’t with Jimin.
Jimin comments every so often.
Mostly, though, he listens.
Best of all, he doesn’t judge.
---
Namjoon initiates it. Jimin would never think to. He’d never want to be seen as taking advantage.
---
The first kiss is awkward and Jimin pulls away. Walls himself up in his room for the day and Namjoon contemplates leaving.
He doesn’t.
Which is good, because the second kiss is a little better, and Jimin doesn’t run away this time. He doesn’t push back, but he smiles when Namjoon pulls away.
---
Namjoon turns twenty-six with four more people around than he’s used to.
He doesn’t find himself in an alley on his knees.
He doesn’t have to do anything he doesn’t really want to to make enough money to survive.
He eats a homemade cake.
(Taehyung calls Seokjin on the lie--it’s a box mix.)
(Seokjin looks angry and refuses to sit next to Taehyung for the rest of the night. Conversation between the pair is tense and terse.)
(Namjoon feels like he caused it. It’s his birthday, after all.)
(Seokjin and Taehyung kiss lightly while putting their shoes on and Namjoon assumes they made up somewhere between the couch and the doorway, though he’s not sure how or when.)
Namjoon tells them all about how to make roses and carnations and lilies out of frosting.
---
When it’s finally just him and Jimin, the water in the tub is steaming and pale green and they barely both fit in it at the same time, but they can manage if they press close and hold onto each other tight enough.
When it’s finally just him and Jimin, Namjoon’s laid out on the bed.
They’re both still damp from the bath.
And the lights are dimmed to the color of daffodils.
And Jimin doesn’t have to, but he wants to.
And that makes all the difference in the world.



Chapter End Notes
When you give someone a single daffodil, it means misfortune. More than one daffodil means new beginnings. They can also be unrequited love, joy and happiness, and rebirth!Yellow carnations mean disdain, rejection, and disappointment.Amaryllis symbolize determination and beauty. White roses are sympathy, true love, and innocence. These two were picked because they are considered ‘winter’ flowers and Jimin got them in the winter.I don’t know much about homelessness in Seoul. The only thing I know is this one youtube video interview where a foreigner was talking about the differences between Seoul and the US and she was like ‘there are pretty much no homeless people out here!’I said there would be happy endings, not always happy middles. I didn't mean to make Jungkook and Hoseok the 'bad guys' here, but. So it goes.In one of the MV making/Jacket shooting videos, someone says Namjoon can't eat crab. I just watched it the other day, so the knowledge is fresh in my mind.I'm also a little ehh about my characterization of Jimin. I don't feel like I did a good job. The chapter wasn't as easy to write as the previous ones were, or as the following two wound up being.This one got a little heavier than I anticipated, man. I didn’t know where it was headed, but that was not where I expected it to go.I also made myself sad with this chapter? I don’t quite know how, but. I did. Oh well.P.S. Jimin sucked Namjoon's dick at the end yepp that was a thing that happened


Taehyung
Chapter Notes
I’ve got two weeks to finish the final chapter of this story if I want to keep up with my update schedule. It’s taking so long, oh my god. It’s so much harder than I anticipated and I’m struggling, hahaha.And again, a little heavier with the sex stuff. Whoops. Sorry for that.

        See the end of the chapter for more notes




As jobs went, this one seemed pretty low stress at first. It dealt with animals, after all. How much stress can animals create?
---
A lot. The answer is: a lot.
---
Namjoon’s parents had never let him have a pet of any kind. The closest was his stuffed lion when he was little. His dad took Ryan away when Namjoon turned seven, saying it would make him soft if he kept playing with it.
Namjoon remembers crying for days. He remembers having trouble sleeping without his best buddy held tight in his little arms. He remembers his mom trying to cheer him up with ice cream and pop.
He was placated, but he never forgot. Even now, he remembers that feeling of loss. He’s felt it again many times since, but that was the very first.
---
The point is, the only experience Namjoon has with Actual Live Animals came from his old friends’ pets or the random strangers on the street that let him pet their dogs.
And the one time he had a babysitting gig where the family had a goldfish.
---
Somehow, the damn thing timed its death to happen when Namjoon was there alone with the child.
The parents had bought the fish the day their five year old son was born.
Seokjin wailed the entire six hours Namjoon was watching him because Namjoon had to flush the fish within the first half hour of being left alone. All he’d done was give it a few flakes of food as per instruction.
Seokjin’s mom and dad were not happy. Superstitious to a fault, they thought it meant Namjoon would harm their son somehow.
He was fired after that and decided he didn't really want to deal with kids anymore. Too messy.
---
But animals. Animals should be easy, right? They're usually older, right? Once they can leave their moms and dads and be sold in a petshop, they're pretty self sufficient.
Definitely.
That’s how that works.
He’s got this.
---
He'd told his boss, Taehyung, that he had all kinds of experience. That he'd owned fish and hermit crabs and hamsters and rabbits before. He'd volunteered at shelters for dogs and cats. That he even knew how to ride a horse (even if he'd never need the skill for this job, living in Seoul).
---
In truth, Namjoon had never even seen a real, live horse. He was twenty-two years old and not once has a horse been in his life.
He's a fraud.
---
Taehyung hires him. The kid seems pretty intimidating at first. His face is blank and expressionless. He's calm and collected when he asks Namjoon questions.
He's wearing a suit during the interview.
Namjoon is in grease stained jeans and a threadbare sweater.
But he gets the job.
---
On his first day, it takes Taehyung all of five seconds to realize Namjoon has never worked with animals. If asked, he'd venture to guess Namjoon has probably never even touched an animal before.
It's kind of funny to him.
And, above all else, Taehyung loves funny things. (Well. Perhaps not above his love for dogs. They sit firmly at the top of his love list. The only thing that could take over the number one spot would be his own dog, but his apartment doesn’t allow large pets. Until the day he gets his very own dog, All Dogs occupy that first spot.)
He decides to see how this plays out. It can’t be that bad, he’s sure.
---
Namjoon’s first task had been to clean the rabbit cage. That meant catching the rabbits in the cage and moving them to temporary housing for the duration of the cleaning.
Rabbits were typically easy animals, especially since Taehyung handled them all the time. He wanted his animals people friendly, so hours upon hours were spent touching and petting all the animals in his care.
The rabbits loved people.
They didn't love Namjoon.
---
He wound up being bitten more times than he cared to admit. Taehyung took pity on him twenty minutes in and jokingly asked if he was positive he'd owned rabbits in the past.
And then he calmly snatched at the scruff and picked one rabbit up and out, cushioning its hind legs and tummy with his other hand.
In less than two minutes, all four rabbits were successfully rehomed into the temporary cage.
Namjoon cleaned their larger enclosure and then tried to emulate what he'd seen earlier to get the rabbits back where they belonged.
---
Namjoon was bitten five more times. He gave up. Taehyung moved the rabbits back to the cleaned tank, smiling all the while.
---
Namjoon came back into the store the second day, though. He'd gone to the library and read up on the animals in the pet store. He knew a little bit more, now. He hoped it was easier to put into practice than some things he's tried.
---
Taehyung doesn't give him the chance to touch the animals that day. Instead, Namjoon reorganizes stock. It's a simpler task and he can't really complain.
He still breaks skin on a particularly sharp shelving corner, but Taehyung, like the day before, has bandages at the ready.
---
Despite the suit at the interview, Namjoon learns (to his partial dismay) that Taehyung is actually rather like a large child. His work clothes are jeans and T-shirts of various designs and witty sayings, most to do with animals or anime in some capacity. The bandages he offers are for children--dinosaurs and cartoons and Hello Kitty. (Taehyung himself sports them when he has his own scratches and cuts.)
Taehyung smiles while offering Namjoon his choice of design.
The smile is boxy and wide and shows too many teeth.
A far cry from the man in the suit.
Then again, he’s sure most people have different versions of themselves they show.
---
Namjoon has a battalions worth. One for every job.
---
The cycle continues. Taehyung tries to find an animal that doesn’t dislike Namjoon. The birds bite and squawk and make messes when he’s near. The crabs pinch. The rabbits, snakes,  hamsters, lizards bite.
Taehyung decides Namjoon is either a bad person, or was in a past life.
He seems like a really good man right now, though. So it must have been a past life that caused these problems.
And Namjoon can’t really be at fault for that!
---
“Let’s try fish today, yeah, Hyung?”
Namjoon looks uncertain.
“All you have to do is catch them with this little net and transfer them to this other tank so you can clean the one they’re in right now. It’s easy!”
Namjoon doesn’t look convinced.
“You can decorate the aquarium when you’re done?”
---
It takes Namjoon an embarrassingly long amount of time to catch every fish in the tank. But he does it.
He doesn't drop a single one.
He doesn’t let any flop out of the net or the tanks.
None of them die.
---
He was having flashbacks to that damn goldfish the whole time.
---
When Namjoon finishes cleaning the aquarium, he finds what he wants to use to decorate it. Channels his inner small child.
But that just makes him think of his father and his mother and his stuffed lion.
So he stops and returns the decorations.
---
The tank winds up boring. Black pebbles and rocks on the bottom. A grey stone castle. A white stone bridge. A fake, plastic plant here and there.
Nothing bubbles. Nothing moves.
Namjoon pours the water in and works on replacing the fish.
---
Taehyung pulls a face when he sees the finished product.
Promises himself to work on Namjoon’s design tastes.
And Taehyung always keeps his promises. Especially the promises he makes to himself.
---
Every day, Taehyung has Namjoon clean a different aquarium. The fish never die. None of them attempt to escape.
Namjoon does a good job.
He has to redecorate the aquariums every time he cleans them.
---
At least there’s bubbles in a few of them.
---
Namjoon tries. He just doesn’t know what he’s doing. Other than clearly disappointing Taehyung, that is.
He doesn’t even know why he cares this much either. Of course he wants to keep his job, but--but the way Taehyung always looks at the tanks when Namjoon is finished.
It aches.
Namjoon wants to do better.
He wants to be on the receiving end of that smile one more time.
He just doesn’t understand why.
---
Summer rolls in and it’s impossibly hot.
Even the hot weather animals need cooled down.
Taehyung spends most of his time flitting around the shop, checking temperatures in tanks and cages.
He doesn’t want anyone getting heatstroke or hypothermia.
Namjoon’s skeptical that anything could get hypothermia when the cold is only being produced by a box fan blowing hot air, but hey.
He’s not the expert.
---
With how he acts sometimes, Namjoon’s not sure Taehyung is an expert either.
And then Namjoon or a customer will ask a question and Taehyung’s face will light up and his eyes will sparkle with all the stars in the universe and Namjoon will be struck with a desire to listen. The facts and information and knowledge Taehyung has inside of him is startling sometimes.
---
“It’s hot, Namjoon-hyung. Watch the store for a few minutes?”
“Of course, Taehyung.”
---
When Taehyung returns, he’s holding two bottles of pop in his arms and two ice creams in his hands. “Pick what you want and I’ll take the other, Hyung. Be quick--they might boil and melt away if you take too long!”
---
Namjoon hasn’t had ice cream in a long time. Or pop, for that matter. He mostly survives off of water and crackers with some peanut butter thrown in for variety.
But he drinks the Sprite and eats the fudge bar with reckless abandon.
He’s reminded, for a moment, of his mother the day Ryan was taken. Namjoon shakes his head to dismiss the thoughts.
This is nothing like that.
This is ice cream and pop with his boss.
This is Taehyung chatting enthusiastically about his Coke and his strawberry bar. How he’s actually kind of happy Namjoon picked the other two, but he wouldn’t have been angry if he hadn’t.
Taehyung smiles, but it’s not rectangular and there’s not enough teeth.
---
It’s a nice day regardless.
---
Namjoon turns twenty-three in the library. He reads the book on cake decorating, but doesn’t finish it. He stops after the instructions on daffodil icing flowers.
He’s also pulled out a few small volumes on fish and their aquariums. They're a little more interesting now than they would have been in the past.
He sees them as instruction manuals for boxy grins.
---
“Are you doing anything fun for Chuseok?”
Namjoon tenses, but shakes his head, leaning a little deeper into the tank. It’s a large one, used to house an almost miniature ecosystem. It needed an extremely deep clean, though it usually looks good due to the species of live plants and fish inside. Taehyung insists it gets a little work done at least once every six months or so.
This is the first time Namjoon has been entrusted with the duty.
“Uh. No. I'm not. Probably just sitting in my apartment. My family is…,” a pause. He keeps his eyes trained on the glass of the aquarium. “It's complicated.”
Taehyung tilts his head to one side. It almost offsets the parrot sitting on his shoulder, but the bird squawks and tugs harshly on hair to reprimand the man, and Taehyung apologizes to it profusely before redirecting his attention back to Namjoon.
“It's only as complicated as you allow it to be,” he finally decides. But that's all he says.
Taehyung is off, feeding the bird a treat when it repeats a whistle he does for it as he leaves the aquatic section of the store.
---
Namjoon tries to think about what Taehyung said, but he can't make heads or tails of it.
He’s never felt so stupid in his life.
---
Another week--just one before Chuseok-- and Namjoon asks if Taehyung has plans for the holiday.
“Of course I do! I'm going back to my home town! I'll be visiting with a dog, and the last time I saw him, it was forever ago!” He’s grinning. It’s large and beaming, but not quite the one Namjoon dreams about.
Namjoon doesn’t remember when he started seeing the toothy grin in his sleep, but it’s become quite common recently.
He nods a little, regardless. “That sounds fun, Taehyung. I hope you have a great time.”
“Oh, I know that I will if there’s a dog involved.”
---
Taehyung offers to invite him, but Namjoon rejects the idea. It's much too late to spring that on someone.
And he's sure he'd feel so awkward about it.
---
It's snows while Taehyung is gone for Chuseok.
---
Namjoon was asked to watch over the store while Taehyung was away. He has the key and everything. He can open the store if he wants to, but he doesn't have to. All Taehyung needs him to do is care for the animals and dust the displays.
But Namjoon opens the store for a little while everyday, if only to be able to stay there longer. It’s warm for the animals, and his apartment is cold.
When he realizes no one is going to police how much time he spends inside the shop, though, he stops opening and simply works on things inside.
Busies himself cleaning and decorating aquariums.
Stays warm and cozy.
Convinces a rabbit to like him. (Which was difficult and not something he plans to do again.)
Most of all, he hopes Taehyung enjoys the fish when he returns.
---
Taehyung comes back after a week. His cheeks are puffy and he's got a noticeable stomach now.
Namjoon is still skin and bones with loose clothes. They hang from his frame like leaves on the branches of trees in the fall.
One strong gust away from death's grip. One bitter drop in temperature and he’ll be gone.
---
“You did all of these?”
Namjoon nods.
“They look amazing, Namjoon! They're so unique! So lively! This one has a handmade rock cave!”
Namjoon just shrugs. His cheeks are a little pink, but not much. He looks away to hide it.
Taehyung notices anyway.
---
Taehyung asks if Namjoon has plans for Christmas.
Namjoon tells him it's complicated.
Taehyung shrugs and flips a hand haphazardly through the air.. “If you say it is, I believe you. But everything is complicated if you look at it abstractly enough.”
Namjoon doesn't answer. He works on setting up hamster tanks.
They’re not as easy to decorate as those for fish are. The damn things are escape artists, so he has to make sure the climbing bars don’t go close enough to be used to get out. There’s a lot more thinking involved.
---
Namjoon works over the Christmas holiday. Taehyung leaves. Namjoon assumes he's visiting family.
But then Taehyung calls the shop on Christmas day to wish Namjoon a Merry Christmas. There's another voice over the phone, and Taehyung laughs. It all sounds too childish to be parents or aunts and uncles.
Suddenly, Taehyung is yelling at someone named Yoongi-hyung to get his ass under the mistletoe before Jungkook-hyung grows a second head. Something offhanded about the ‘poor guy, bless his heart, watching the doorway for an hour waiting for Hyung to get up’.
He's back to Namjoon quickly enough.
“I still wish you had come with me, Hyung. You would have liked it here. Less snow. You’ve been complaining about the snow since it started falling.”
“I'd have had to get a million presents for people I don't know, Tae. It's better this way. But snow is terrible.”
“I would have boxed something up for you, you know. Whatever. Just--Merry Christmas, Hyung. Stay warm!”
“You too, Tae. Safe trip home.”
Taehyung makes a contented noise over the phone before they hang up.
---
He doesn't return until after New Year’s. Namjoon doesn’t understand why until Taehyung tells him he just had a birthday.
“A few more hours and I’d have been a 96-liner,” he’s laughing, piddling around with things that don’t need messed with. Namjoon kept up with everything perfectly well. Taehyung’s happy and impressed.
---
“I almost forgot this,” Taehyung says a week later, offering Namjoon a pristinely wrapped gift. The paper isn’t Christmas themed--there’s elephants in birthday hats and carrying brightly wrapped presents parading across the package. It’s got ribbon and a handmade bow on the outside and a nametag with ‘Namjoon’ written out carefully.
Namjoon’s brows furrow. He opens his mouth, but Taehyung pushes the package into the other’s hands.
“You’re my only employee, Namjoon-hyung. And I’d like to think you’re my friend to some extent, right?” a shrug. “Merry Christmas?” Taehyung tosses him a nervous smile.
Namjoon shifts, hands clumsily holding the box. He hasn’t had a gift in years and he’s not quite sure what to do with it at the moment.
He looks up, frowning lightly.
“I...don’t have anything for you, though.”
Taehyung shrugs again. It seems to be all he can do at the moment. “I know. Seeing you open it will be good enough.”
He thinks about asking for a can of coke as a joke, but he’s not sure Namjoon would want to spend the money.
Taehyung pays him fairly, but Namjoon always looks too hungry.
It’s worrying.
Taehyung doesn’t know where all the money goes.
---
Mostly, it goes to rent.
---
Namjoon opens the gift carefully, almost as if he doesn’t want to rip the paper too much.
It’s winter accessories. New ones. None of them match, but they’re independently the most beautiful things Namjoon has laid eyes on. Together, they’re a masterpiece, fit for a museum.
“I… I don't…”
“Ahh. Sorry. I should have gotten matching ones. I can return them if you'd--”
“No!” it's fast. Namjoon looks up quickly. “No. They're perfect. I… thank you. Thank you, Taehyung. They're perfect. I just don't know how to thank you, honestly.”
Taehyung shrugs. Namjoon worries for his shoulder muscles. “Don't make it complicated.”
---
Namjoon tries not to let it get to him. Taehyung is just so nice. So kind.
He smiles and Namjoon feels the world brighten.
It doesn't make much sense.
---
In February, two people Namjoon has never seen before come in. That's not entirely unusual. For him to know every customer that walks through the door would be impossible.
However, it would seem that Taehyung knows them. He wishes one of them a Happy Birthday.
They've come to get a pet in celebration, but don't quite know what to purchase.
The birthday boy is frightened of a lot of things.
---
Reptiles and birds are no good, along with anything small and rodent-like. Ferrets freak him out and rabbits scream when they're scared, which Jimin assures Taehyung is a scary enough thought. They don’t need him to look up videos to prove this fact, thank you very much.
Namjoon finally speaks, suggesting they get the supplies for a fish tank.
---
It works well. The pair get a twenty gallon tank and everything needed to set it up. They'll return in a few days to actually buy the fish, once the water has had time to settle.
Namjoon assists in getting what they want when they do return.
Plecos to do regular cleaning, an angel fish (which Hoseok, Namjoon now knows, jokes about for a good half hour, saying he'll name it Hobi, after himself, ‘an absolute angel’) and a random assortment of tetras in various colors and styles.
(Hoseok also insists upon a bubble eyed goldfish, which he names Manggaetteok. Namjoon doesn't understand, but Jimin flushes, so Namjoon assumes it's an inside joke.)
The pair leave happily and Taehyung congratulates Namjoon on a job well done.
---
Namjoon’s just happy to be given one of those boxy grins.
He spends the rest of the day flying.
---
Winter finishes up quickly. The February lion making an attempt to roar once more, but giving up without much fuss and making way for the delicate March lamb.
---
Two shakes of the lamb’s tail and spring and summer have passed as well.
Namjoon doesn't know where the time has gone.
---
Fall brings a chill that Namjoon fights off with his sweaters. Taehyung brings him coffee or hot chocolate every day.
The first day, it was ‘they accidentally made a second one and offered it to me’ hot chocolate.
The second day, Taehyung didn't even bother to hide that he purchased it specifically with Namjoon in mind.
---
“I bought you coffee. It's black, but I got some creamer and sugar packets in case you wanted them. I didn’t know how you took your coffee.”
Namjoon shifts.
“You don’t have to do that, Taehyung.”
“It’s cold out. Coffee is hot. Don’t burn your tongue,” the younger pauses for a moment. “Don’t--.”
“Make it complicated,” Namjoon finishes, reaching for the cup and a couple of creamers. “Thanks, Tae. I appreciate it.”
---
He really does. Namjoon savors the bitter taste as he sips it. Tries to make it last, but after an hour, it’s getting to be the temperature of the room, and tasting weird because of it, so he gulps the rest down quickly.
It’s a disappointment to lose such a treat so fast, but he manages.
---
Namjoon turns twenty-four in his apartment, technically. At midnight, he’s asleep. It’s chilly and he’s layered up in the fall because winter’s hitting early.
The lion is back with a vengeance, chasing the skittish lamb into hiding.
Namjoon wakes to a dusting of snow on the ground. It sticks and it lays and there’s nothing that will make it go away until spring.
---
Namjoon loses a button from his coat putting it on that morning. He adjusts the scarf Taehyung got him the year before to cover the open part at the top, and leaves for work. His gloves and hat do well in the early morning chill, and he’s quite content to take his time on the walk.
It’s a couple of blocks, but he knows the pet store will be nice and toasty.
---
Taehyung notices the missing button. He doesn't mention it, but he does stash the information away for later.
---
Namjoon goes to the library after work. Taehyung tags along.
---
“What are you doing after work today, Hyung?”
Namjoon glances up. “I, uh. I'm going to the library.” He looks back down to the crab tank, plucking shells from the dirt to inspect the hidden creatures inside. A few brave souls poke their heads or claws or antennae out to see what’s going on, but Namjoon doesn't let them get close enough to pinch. He’s learned his lesson time and time again.
“Library? I haven't been to one of those since college!” Taehyung grins, but it's not the one Namjoon is waiting for. “Do you mind if I come along? There might be something cool to read there. It's full of books, after all.”
Namjoon shifts his weight from foot to foot, but agrees. Maybe the company would be nice. He hasn’t had company in a long time.
---
Namjoon’s settled at a table in the back corner with his book on cake decorating.
He's just getting to the part about icing tips when Taehyung returns to the table. The younger quirks his head.
“I didn't take you for the cake decorating type,” he settles in with a small stack of books. Namjoon glances at the spines and sees variable titles.
101 Things You Didn't Know About Dinosaurs.
Indoor Gardening For The Young Adult.
Korean Wild Birds and How To Find Them.
“I didn't take you for…that,” he gestures to the stack.
Taehyung laughs and Namjoon practically swoons. “I like learning all kinds of stuff. I'm just going to skim these, probably. Then go get comics or a book of jokes or something.”
Taehyung smiles and Namjoon falls a little more.
If he weren't sitting steadily in a chair, he’s sure he'd be on the floor.
---
It occurred to Namjoon somewhere between being given a gift and today that he might be in love with the other man.
But it’s a strange sort of feeling. He’s never been in love before. But whenever he thinks of Taehyung, his stomach is suddenly full of butterflies.
And when he thinks of that smile, he chokes on their wings.
He’s found that he doesn’t mind the breathlessness. It’s like he’s floating.
---
And Namjoon wants to soar.
---
“So you never responded. Not really,” as though what Taehyung had spoken earlier had been a question, “Why cake decorating?”
Namjoon shrugs, pulling his scarf tighter. It's suddenly very cold and windy outside. Namjoon feels as if he's being cut by a million, tiny, frozen knives.
His cheeks are red, and it's probably from the wind.
---
Probably.
---
It could be from the fact that Taehyung forgot his gloves at the pet store and has one hand grasped firmly in Namjoon’s. Both are shoved into the pocket of Taehyung’s coat, working to keep them toasty warm.
---
“I read it every year today,” a weak shrug. He doesn't want to explain further, but Taehyung asks. Namjoon finds he can't say no.
“It's...my birthday,” he glances off, not wanting to see Taehyung’s face at the moment. He assumes it's going to be disappointed.
“Oh. Well. Happy Birthday, Hyung. If I had known, I would have gotten you something!”
Namjoon shakes his head. “That would make everything more complicated than it needs to be, Taehyung.”
Taehyung stops walking. Namjoon gets pulled to a halt by their connected hands. He hasn't been paying attention to where they were headed. No matter where they ended up, Namjoon was sure he'd be able to get himself home.
He had grown to live and breathe this city.
“It's not complicated, Namjoon-hyung. It's really not.” Taehyung’s voice is quiet. He’s staring at Namjoon with an indiscernible expression.
---
Namjoon turns twenty-four and one day in Taehyung’s apartment. In Taehyung’s bed.
---
In Taehyung.
---
It's the first time he's slept with a man. The first time he's slept with anyone. The first time he’s done anything past nervous groping of breasts and hesitant handjobs from girls when he was thirteen.
Fourteen.
Fifteen.
He didn’t decide he was gay without evidence to back it up.
---
It's not like Namjoon did much as far as the process went. Taehyung sat him on the bed and prepared himself. Talked Namjoon through it, even as his own fingers did the work.
It was languid and slow and measured and Namjoon could hardly look away, even as his face burned with the heat of the sun.
His mouth dried out quickly and, when Taehyung finally decided he was ready, he laid Namjoon out on his back and did everything all by himself, sitting straight on the elders thighs and sinking down and down and down and Namjoon thought, for a moment, that Taehyung would never stop sinking.
He reached to grab, hands holding onto beautiful, golden hips in hopes that he’d be able to rescue the younger from his inevitable demise.
All he manages to do before they’re done is press ten finger bruises into the smooth flesh.
---
Namjoon didn't take long, but Taehyung didn't expect him too.
Once Namjoon was spent, Taehyung settled next to him, fingers trailing along protruding ribs and thin stomach. They walked up thin, chilled skin and rubbed careful lines against Namjoon’s sternum. Taehyung flattened his hand out to feel the heartbeat hidden within.
Namjoon was breathing heavily, chest heaving and lungs aching. He felt like he'd run a marathon.
But like he'd won it.
---
Once Namjoon calmed himself, it occurs to him that Taehyung hadn't reached the end, and he shifted his weight, looking sheepishly to the younger.
“Let me just--.”
“It’s fine, Hyung,” and Taehyung smiles. It's boxy and bright, even if he looks as tired as Namjoon feels. “Next time, yeah?” he shifts, leaning up to press a kiss to the corner of Namjoon’s mouth.
---
Morning comes and Namjoon’s awake, staring at a ceiling he doesn’t recognize.
‘Next time?’ he thinks.
He’s giddy and swallows back childish laughter and manages to get a few more minutes of sleep.
---
“Come with me for Chuseok. I’ll have Jimin tend to the animals. You can’t just stay in Seoul the rest of your life.”
Namjoon agrees without any hesitation. It surprises him, but he doesn’t complain. He can’t say he doesn’t like this new development.
---
He and Taehyung spend a few hours together on a train. They share Taehyung’s headphones and Taehyung’s music. Namjoon is surprised to find a mix of rap and pop and trot, of all things.
He’s even more surprised when it’s two men that pick them up from the train station as opposed to Taehyung’s parents.
---
Namjoon is introduced readily to Yoongi and Jungkook, both his and Taehyung’s seniors. Both immediately insist upon ‘hyung’ rather than -sii.
Namjoon is not going to argue.
They seem welcoming and friendly, albeit a little shy. Nothing like Taehyung is or as he described them. Then again, perhaps it’s the hour of the day--picking someone up from the train station at eleven PM is probably annoying.
---
“I thought,” Namjoon started, curled in a small bed in the guest room of Yoongi and Jungkook’s apartment, “that we were coming to visit your parents? Your family? It’s Chuseok, after all.”
The two strangers aren’t married, but according to Taehyung, they might as well be. Just haven’t had the energy to fly somewhere their lifestyle is legal.
Taehyung laughs lightly. His cold hands sneak up the back of Namjoon’s shirt, flattening out on the skin he finds there. Namjoon shivers, but doesn’t fight it or pull away. “No, I haven’t spoken to my parents in years Namjoon-hyung.”
Namjoon furrows his brows, but Taehyung continues before Namjoon can speak.
“And they’re the closest thing to family I have.”
“Complicated, than?” Namjoon’s kicking himself the minute he says it. He knows what the answer is going to be.
“Not really,” another laugh. Taehyung wiggles closer. Tosses one leg over both of Namjoon’s, then decides to try and wedge his other between the pair, now made more difficult by the added weight of his own leg on top. “I’m bisexual and my parents decided my two younger siblings had a better shot at giving them grandchildren than I did.” There’s a bit of a shrug, but it’s awkward since he’s laying on his side. “They tossed me out when I was...seventeen? Maybe eighteen. Let me finish high school at least. I just forget how old I was at the time.”
Taehyung yawns. It forces his mouth wider than Namjoon is used to seeing it. There are just as many teeth, though.
“Jungkook-hyung found me out in the rain--how pitiful is that? Like a goddamn drama!--and took me in. Yoongi-hyung tried to pretend that he hated it, but he was the one who kept making me food.” The smile Taehyung gives is sleepy, but bright and fond. Already, the younger is starting to drift off. “They helped me get into college and get on my feet when I was done. I got a degree in business, which is why I own one,” a shift. Taehyung starts to settle in, face pressing to Namjoon’s neck.
He flicks his tongue out to leave a wet line across the skin, then blows gently to cool and dry the spot. His cheek rests there when he’s done.
Namjoon wants to ask a few more questions, but the trip down to Daegu and the incredibly late hour have taken a toll on Taehyung. He’s already asleep.
---
The next morning, Namjoon wakes up to the smell of food. He gently rouses Taehyung and, together, they make their way to the kitchen.  Everything looks and smells amazing, and Namjoon has never wanted to eat so bad in his life.
He's practically drooling.
He swallows hard.
He had been.
---
Jungkook warns Yoongi to stop feeding Namjoon. Yoongi tells his lover to stuff it. He’s older by almost a year. He’ll do what he wants.
---
Namjoon spends the afternoon in the bathroom, cheek resting against the toilet seat when he’s not heaving into the bowl.
Taehyung spends the afternoon in the bathroom, hands passing through Namjoon’s hair or rubbing soothing lines up and down his back.
They can both hear their elders arguing in the kitchen.
“I feel terrible,” Namjoon manages, heaving only once during the sentence.
“Don't,” Taehyung seems to understand Namjoon is talking about the argument, not his general state of being, even if that’s pretty shitty too. “If they weren't fighting about you, they'd be fighting about something else. They’re in love. It’s what they do sometimes,” a pause. “Would a visit from Min Holly make you feel any better? I can bring him in if you'd like?”
Namjoon thinks about it and goes to nod, but throws up instead.
In the end, he decides not to see the dog.
He doesn't want to vomit on the poor thing.
---
They go back to Seoul two days after Chuseok. They carry Tupperware containers full of leftovers with them. Taehyung is rounder. His cheeks are puffy with salt.
Namjoon is, perhaps, a little better off. Not much. There's only so much a couple of days can do, especially when he’s thrown most of the food back up.
---
“Not to sound rude, but. Do you have a fridge?”
Namjoon startles, watching Taehyung in surprise. “I--.” He's not sure how to answer. He has one, but he leaves it unplugged. The damn thing eats up too much electricity. And, really, Namjoon shouldn’t be surprised by Taehyung’s forwardness. It’s commonplace, now.
“That's fine. You'll just have to come over to my place to eat your half of the food,” Taehyung glances over to Namjoon, wetting his lips when they make eye contact. “Or, you know. Do other things.”
Namjoon turns red and shoves his half of the containers into Taehyung’s grip. “I should be getting home!” and he turns and goes down the street quickly, not wanting to look back.
“Why?” Taehyung calls after him, head tipped to the side. “What’s waiting for you there?”
Namjoon stops. It’s sudden and he almost trips over his own two feet in his haste to stop moving.
---
“It’s--.”
“Don’t you dare say it’s complicated.”
---
Namjoon doesn’t.
He doesn’t say anything.
---
He winds up at Taehyung’s place again. Namjoon is still awkward there. It doesn’t feel like his own space, which make sense because it isn’t. Nevertheless, he drops his old duffel bag on the floor by the couch and crashes down onto it without hesitation.
Taehyung joins him shortly, stradling Namjoon’s lap and resting his arms on the elder’s shoulders. “We’re going to work on something, me and you.” His forehead presses to Namjoon’s, making sure they’re making eye contact and he threads his fingers into shaggy, oily hair. “I’m going to get you to put on weight and you're going to be healthy, both in body and in mind.”
Namjoon opens his mouth to say something (he thinks, perhaps, to argue. But how can he really argue with what Taehyung wants to do to him), but Taehyung kisses him instead.
“It’s going to take effort,” the younger rolls his hips down, “But I think we’ll both manage.” He kisses Namjoon again, a little harder. “What I get in return is you being happy. It doesn’t have to be today or tomorrow, or even a month from now. It doesn’t even have to be with me. But eventually, I want you to be happy.”
---
It wasn’t that day, though the aftermath of their time on the couch was pretty decent, sticky mess aside.
It wasn’t the next day.
And it certainly wasn’t a month from then.
---
It was with Taehyung, though.
---
Namjoon went with Taehyung back to Daegu for Christmas. He didn’t take gifts. Taehyung told him not to.
It felt strange.
It was even stranger when Taehyung had gifts for Yoongi and Jungkook--some addressed from Namjoon.
---
Taehyung turns twenty-three in Daegu. He’s had every birthday in that city since he existed.
This time, though, he was squeezed into a twin bed in a spare room with another man.
One who snores.
But he wasn’t about to complain.
---
When they get back to Seoul, Taehyung takes the bus to Namjoon’s apartment.
He insists on helping Namjoon to pack. There's not much, he finds. Stuff or stuff to do there.
So Taehyung finds something to keep them occupied and waste a little time.
---
They rutt against each other on the small pile of thin blankets in the corner. Come with the friction and Taehyung’s hushed and hot whispers in Namjoon’s ears and Namjoon’s needy moans and breaths and pleas in Taehyung’s. They lay panting and sweaty and sticky when they’re done, mouths dry and lips slightly bruised from kissing.
Namjoon thinks it's the best feeling he's ever had in this apartment.
They pack his things after quick rinses at the bathroom sink. The bus ride is awkward if only because their pants are stained under the lap full of things they both carry.
---
It doesn't take long for Namjoon to feel comfortable in Taehyung’s apartment after that. It's small, but it's lively. Aside from the store, Taehyung has his own private menagerie of animals to his name.
Namjoon is hated by all but the fish, who are too small to really hate anything other than bigger, hungrier fish, which Namjoon is not one of.
(Perhaps he's hungrier, but not for those particular fish.)
Taehyung also has a relatively good green thumb, and all the windowsills are covered in green, leafy plants.
Namjoon has always liked being in here.
---
They roll around the bed that first night. Lots of touching.
Lots of exploring.
Lots of words.
Taehyung doesn't like silence. It's unnerving to him. He explains that it reminds him of those last few months living with his parents. How they ignored his existence. How they didn’t say a thing to him. They let him live and let him survive, but never told him when dinner was ready or when they were going out.
He’s very open about everything. Speaks easily about what happened to him and how he felt when and where and how.
Namjoon doesn't mind the constant noise. He doesn't mind quiet either, but this is nice.
This is Taehyung.
This is something he'll get used to quickly.
---
Taehyung doesn’t seem to mind that Namjoon doesn’t offer much about his own life. There are snippets, every so often, but never a full explanation.
Taehyung assumes that Namjoon will tell him everything when he’s ready. It might not be today, and it might not be tomorrow.
It might not be a month from now and it might not be all at once.
But Taehyung will learn what he needs to know.
---
And, really, none of it’s important. He loves Namjoon now. Not all those years ago.
---
Namjoon thinks the whole thing is pretty complicated, but he'd never tell Taehyung. To the younger, this is just as it should be. One brave lion who knows what he wants and one lost, lonely lamb still stumbling around, trying to get his bearings on unsteady, spindly legs.
---
Namjoon is sure Taehyung will make a lion of him yet.



Chapter End Notes
All the pets I said Namjoon had are pets I have/had. I also volunteered at an animal shelter with dogs and cats. I don’t, however, know how to properly ride a horse. I have ridden them before, though.Also, woah I did not anticipate the sex????  That really did come out of nowhere. Like Namjoon.Oh well.Hope it didn't ruin the chapter. And I know Ryan is a bear and not a lion. I know that because I googled it after I wrote the entire chapter to make sure he was a lion so it would fit in with the story only to find out he was a goddamn bear. Well, he’s a lion now.I don’t know why I thought he was a lion. It was probably his coloration -_-’’’’And fish tanks don't really get deep cleaned unless there's a disease outbreak. But it's the only way I could explain quickly that Namjoon emptied the tank and is wiping it down and whatnot.

Chapter Notes
This is the last single chapter! The next chapter is going to be a group version. And there may be a surprise, but we’ll see how that works out.I don't have much to say? There's a mention of sex, but that's about it.And it might be the shortest chapter? Ironically, I think the other shortest chapter is Yoongi's? Uh. Go figure.

        See the end of the chapter for more notes




The job didn’t last long. Namjoon was back out of work before the first snow started falling. It wasn’t something he was unused to.
What was an unusual phenomenon was that he couldn’t find more work. Maybe he looked too ill or maybe it was because his clothing was too much of a mess for them to want to bother with Namjoon.
But he couldn’t find another job.
---
When Namjoon didn’t pay his rent on time, the landlord gave him until the second of January.
Namjoon packed his things the night of the first and left the next morning. It was impossibly bright and bitterly cold, but he managed.
He hung out in the library for the entire day, leaving his duffel outside the back entrance, hidden in some hedge bushes. He’d pick it up on his way out later that evening.
---
He wasn't unused to living on the streets. It had just been a while. He hadn't lost the apartment since he'd moved in at seventeen. Before then, he’d lived in alleys and in parking lots.
It was just a strange feeling to be back here, was all.
---
Namjoon stays in shelters, never spending more than two consecutive nights in any specific one. He doesn't want them getting suspicious or worried about him.
The last thing he needs is to worry people. Not that he cares. It's just that worried people tend to try and get invested, and he really doesn't need that.  He gets enough of that from the women at the library. But at least they give him snacks from time to time.
They just assume he's a student that spends too much time studying to worry for his own health. He likes that they think so highly of him, but he feels like a cheater. A fraud.
---
They mostly just don’t want to think of the alternatives.
---
He eats at the shelters when he stays there. They serve better food than he's had in a long while.
For a moment, he wonders why he even rented an apartment and attempted to buy his own food.
---
He remembers it's because he doesn't like feeling indebted. Not in that sense. He'll steal and pickpocket, but won't stay long term at a shelter for free food, warmth, and showers.
He felt like he was doing well in life if he had an apartment. That he was making it somehow.
Or at least that he wasn't living on the streets.
---
Which is where Namjoon finds himself come March.
---
How he managed to survive this long in shelters, he doesn't know. But as soon as the weather breaks, he makes a point not to go back. He finds a cozy and clean enough alley with a few other people like him, and he settles in.
Everyone there seems older, but that's not much of a surprise. Namjoon is an oddity in Seoul. Most youth return to their parents or grandparents if they are hard on luck and would have to live on the streets otherwise.
Namjoon doesn't have that luxury.
---
Halfway through summer and he still hadn't found a job. His already thin frame was leaner than he'd ever remembered it being. His clothes hung loose from his form.
He was always so hungry.
---
He fell into something he hadn’t done since his first time alone on the streets.
---
At the age of sixteen, Namjoon had still been growing. If his family had kept him, perhaps he would be taller than he is now. Perhaps he would have filled out more or lost the lankiness to his arms and legs.
Perhaps a lot of things. But perhaps is not what happened and the truth of the matter was a terrified, lonely child of a man trying to figure out of his way in the world after those who should have wanted him no longer cared.
---
He had dug through trash cans at one point. Not dingy dirty ones, but the nicer looking trash cans (if such a thing existed, Namjoon had found it. Or, at the very least, he made himself think he had. Sometimes, getting by is simply doing whatever it takes). Ones outside of restaurants where he’d hopefully find something good and mostly in tact. Something salvageable.
Mostly, he had decent luck.
It had taken a lot of effort to get over the fear or the pride involved in this kind of survival, but he had done it, and he had lived.
Now he’d just have to do it again. No big deal.
---
He still spent most days at the library. He knew they would soon become few and far between as he had limited access to showers and razors, but he’d stop in every so often when he smelled or looked nice enough to.
His clothes would probably look like hell had taken them in personally, but they already kind of looked like that anyway. What would be the harm in showing up like that?
So, when he got the nerve to pop into a shelter for a shower and shave, he’d find himself at the library for a few days, reading as much as he could manage before he’d have to stop coming in for another stretch of time.
---
It was strange, having to scavenge for food again. Every so often, he’d manage to get something from a food cart by looking pitiful enough. If he was shaven and hunched enough, raised his brows higher, tried to put a bright innocence into his eyes, his skinniness could pass him of as a teenager to those not paying enough attention. The workers would sometimes take pity and give him food.
They’d get a million thank yous and bows and he’d head off quickly, not wanting to hang around.
Most of the time, though, he’d pickpocket. Steal from unsuspecting tourists and distracted natives. When he managed to get a good enough looking wallet, he’d take it to different pawn shops across the city and accept whatever the men behind the counters offered.
The men tended to assume the origins of their new wares, but didn’t seem to care. It was something to sell and they didn’t have to pay much for it. Why complain?
---
Namjoon found it easier to trick women and younger-looking workers into giving him food, which is how he ended up at the lamb skewer shop.
The place was small; a relative hole in the wall, and run by two men. One seemed older than Namjoon and the other, younger. It was easy to tell who was running it for the moment by how the customers were acting.
When the older was behind the counter, there was a little less chatter than when the younger was the one at the front of the store. But since dealing with the general public for hours on end got taxing, the pair would switch off every so often.
Namjoon timed his visits to when the crowd seemed more lively.
Namjoon would weave his way through the people and stand himself off to the side, mouth watering when the smell hit him. Different sauces and cooking lamb. A few other things, yeah, but mostly lamb.
---
He’d never been fond of it before.
Well.
That was kind of a lie.
He’d liked it as a young child but when he was nine, his father had told him that lamb actually came from baby sheep, and Namjoon had refused to eat it afterwards. Beef and chicken and fish were one thing--they were adults and got to live a full life (at least, he had assumed they did. He knew better now). But lambs were just babies and babies needed to be protected, not eaten.
---
But beggars can’t be choosers.
He took the lamb skewers when the bright eyed young man offered.
---
Today, the worker noticed Namjoon pretty quickly. He’d grown used to the site of the elder and could find that slightly off-mustard sweater anywhere. Or the dingy brown hoodie. Or grease stained jeans.
And Jungkook smiled, friendly and careful.
“Afternoon, Sir,” he shifted, working on sliding another skewer onto the heat. Namjoon nodded, swallowing back too much saliva. He almost choked, but caught himself with just a sharp cough, directed into an elbow. Jungkook’s brows furrowed in worry, but he didn’t question it. He never asked any questions. It was one of the reasons Namjoon liked him so much.
Namjoon had also managed to shave and shower the day before, so he looked presentable, clothing aside. He didn’t feel as bad when he looked like he bathed regularly.
---
He thanked the kid when the skewer was handed over and left quickly, not wanting the other worker to catch the transaction and yell at the younger. The kid was sweet and innocent. Namjoon didn't want to get him in trouble.
Namjoon felt as though he needed to protect him.
---
As it were, Yoongi knew what Jungkook was doing, and if Namjoon came in during his front of house hours, he would have done the same thing. Once upon a time, Yoongi had been down on his luck. He knows what it feels like to go hungry.
Namjoon looks as though he went hungry a lot.
But Yoongi tends to come off more frightening than Jungkook does, so the taller man stays away when Jungkook isn't on the line.
Yoongi figures it’s his loss.
---
“We did well today, Hyung. I think there were more tourists than usual for this time of year--isn’t it weird?”
“A little, yeah,” Yoongi paused. “You have a visitor today, Jungkook?”
The younger froze, but went back to cleaning the small tables quickly. “I don’t think so?”
“Because I’m pretty sure I saw you hand off a skewer without it being ordered or paid for in advance.”
---
Namjoon stopped in the next week. It was an off day and the shop was pretty quiet. He’d only come in because Jungkook could actually be seen from the front window. The younger smiled and started cooking, leaning on the counter when Namjoon was close enough.
“I’m Jeon Jungkook. Born in Ninety-Seven.”
Namjoon wet his lips, glancing awkwardly down at the other. “Uh.”
“You don’t have to introduce yourself to me, if you don’t want to. This is fine. We’ve just known each other for a couple of months, so I thought it was past due.”
“I--no. It’s--Namjoon. Kim Namjoon. Ninety-Four,” a pause. “You can...call me Hyung, if you want.”
Jungkook’s nose crinkled when he smiled. His eyes twinkled like bright stars. “I’d very much like to, Hyung.”
---
The visits became more common after that, perhaps once a week. Namjoon filled the gaps with other things. He picked through dumpsters and stole wallets for cash. Used cards once or twice each, hoping they didn’t have pins, before throwing them out.
He bought convenience store junk, mostly. Every so often, if he felt the desire, he’d get a piece of fruit. But they tended to be overpriced in small stores like the ones he frequented, and it wasn’t worth the bother. He got enough citrus in the citric acid ingredients to keep scurvy away.
Right?
That’s how that worked?
---
His last science class was tenth grade biology when he was fifteen.
He didn’t remember much past photosynthesis, binomial nomenclature, and Natural Selection.
---
Summer drew to a close and fall drug in heavily, bringing with it a chill that couldn’t be tempted away.
Namjoon turned twenty-three on the streets, but he spent the day in the library reading the book on cake decorating.
He’d managed to get a shave and a shower at a shelter, as well as find a cheap laundromat to wash his clothes at. It was a relief, almost, to smell of something other than dirt and grime and trash.
Namjoon went to the lamb skewer shop later that night, poking around the back rather than going in. He felt as if the birthday had been too good to be true--being cleaned up and spending the entire day at the library? He wasn’t going to risk going inside and getting caught by the older worker.
So instead, he picked through scraps in the trash and ate a few bites here and there before moving on to greener pastures.
---
Winter came almost late enough that Namjoon thought it had decided to pass Seoul by. Perhaps give him the year off and make his life easier. But that was not the case and, as January turned to February, the world darkened and froze.
Ironically, it was the fourteenth that found Namjoon somewhere he didn’t particularly want to be. But it was Valentine’s Day and it was the coldest date on record in Korea since long before Namjoon was born. And this way, at least, he got to be inside a warm apartment for the night.
---
The large sum of cash was a good bonus as well.
---
Though the aching back and legs and ass was not. Neither were the bruises. Or his loss of his dignity in the action.
But he’d spent the night inside, pilfering the strange man’s fridge and pantry. He stole a backpack from the closet and filled it with snacks. Napped by the door until he woke to the stranger stumbling around the apartment in the bright light of the morning with his hangover, and then Namjoon left.
At least he locked the door on his way out.
---
His shoes and coat would barely last the winter, and he knew he’d have to do something before next year rolled around. Start saving up for the thrift store. It wasn’t anything he wasn’t used to doing.
He hoped they’d be alright for the time being.
---
They weren’t. The soles of the shoes broke out before the snow stopped falling for the year. He worked some magic with some scrap cloth he found to tie them back into some sort of shape, but his socks continued to get wet from the outside, no matter what he tried to do.
Jungkook noticed after Namjoon had been into the shop a few times. He wasn’t sure why it took him so long to figure it out--maybe it was because the man was clearly sick when he’d stopped by the fourth time with his shoes beaten out of shape.
Who knew.
“Namjoon-hyung,” a pause while he slides the skewer onto the heat. “Are you okay?”
“Of course, Jungkook, don’t worry about it,” Namjoon manages a tight smile, though he sniffles through it and his voice is a tad hoarse around the edges. This exchange of conversation always seemed strange to him. He was stealing from this business--not exactly, of course. The food was willingly given, but the point of the matter was he still didn’t pay for it--how could the kid be so nonchalant about this?
Everything felt clunky and awkward to Namjoon.
“If you say so, Hyung.”
---
That night, Namjoon found a pair of shoes and socks behind the shop. They weren’t new by any means, and they weren’t quite his size. And he wasn’t sure where they’d even come from, if he were being honest. (Though he could hazard a guess.)
He wasn’t going to complain and, instead, pulled them on quickly, tossing his old ones where they belonged--in the dumpster.
---
“Where did your shoes go, Kid? It’s freezing; you’ll lose your toes like this!”
“I, uh. Lost them, Yoongi-hyung. The shoes, not my toes. And I’ve got a new pair at home, anyway. It’s no big deal.”
“You lost them.”
“Yepp.”
---
Yoongi obviously wasn’t convinced, but he didn’t question it. He just told Jungkook to make sure he didn’t lose the next pair when they parted ways for their respective apartments.
That, and to soak his feet in hot water the minute he got home.
Walking around without shoes on in the winter. Who did this kid think he was?
---
With winter drawing to a close, Namjoon found himself increasingly relieved. There were less problems in the summer and more chances to make money.
He found a few odd jobs here and there--mostly temporary work helping to move people into their new apartments or washing cars at gas stations. The money he made wasn’t much, but it kept him fed and let him wash his clothes, which was more than he had otherwise.
To supplement the inconsistent work, he stole. Plucked wallets from back pockets or open purses.
He made a pretty penny and managed to purchase a thrift shop coat before fall.
---
Namjoon turned twenty-four in the alley he called home. He was a little chilly, but he’d be fine. He wasn’t able to shave that day or the day before, but he went to the library anyway.
The book on cake decorating was gone. The women said a pair of young boys stole it. One with a voice much too loud for a library and the other a smile so cute they could hardly be mad.
The women were still mad, but barely.
Namjoon left without reading anything.
He didn’t bother coming back.
---
(A week later, the boys would return with parents in tow. Seokjin would make the kids return the book and apologize on their knees, bowing deeply. Jimin waited until his lover had taken Hoseok and Taehyung back to the car before explaining they’d only taken the book because Seokjin had been complaining about not being able to decorate cakes as beautifully as he wanted to.
The boys just wanted to make their Daddy happy and were too young to know how libraries really worked.)
---
Fall was unusually warm well into November. Still chilly, but not as much as before. Namjoon stole from pockets and purses and picked through dumpsters when he needed to. He visited the lamb skewer shop every week, sometimes more, and spoke with the young man behind the counter.
The conversations got easier as time went on, and soon, Namjoon was excited to walk through the door, even if he knew the customers would stare. Would whisper.
Would judge.
It was worth it for those bright eyes.
---
“You’re keeping warm, right?”
“Of course, Hyung. You are too, though?”
“...yeah. I would tell you to if I weren’t. You know that, Jungkook.”
---
“You’re studying well in school?”
“I graduated last year, actually. I took the college entrance exam, but I decided not to go. Yoongi-hyung is a good friend and wanted to open up a place like this, so I joined him.”
“It seems to have worked out for you both. It’s pretty popular here.”
“Oh yeah, it definitely is.”
“Well...congratulations. I’m sure you’ve earned it with all the hard work you had to put in.”
“Thank you, Hyung. That means a lot.”
---
“I can’t believe we almost have the same birthday, Hyung. If I had known…”
“It’s fine, Jungkook. What would we have done? Celebrated together?”
“...yeah?”
---
“Is everything okay, Hyung?”
“Of course, Jungkook.”
“You’re not lying are you?”
“What do you take me for? I’d never lie to you!”
---
Fall ended so unexpectedly, Namjoon could have sworn he missed the transition. It was as if one day, everything was reds and yellows and oranges and, the next, he was being shaken awake by another homeless man.
The gentleman hadn’t wanted Namjoon to sleep through the first snow of the year out in the open.
Namjoon thanked him and made his way to a more secluded and covered area, curling back up to sleep once he’d dusted the white powder from his coat and pants and hair.
---
The winter grew worse from there. There wasn’t much snow, but it was so bitter, Namjoon was sure he’d lost fingers and toes a couple of times. He layered all of his socks and sweaters and curled up as best he could to stay warm.
It seemed impossible, but he somehow managed, all digits accounted for.
---
Winter ended almost as abruptly as it started and spring arrived with little warning. Namjoon was relieved to be in the clear for the time being. Sure, there was rain to deal with, but he’d rather be damp and warm over damp and cold. It’s less likely to make him sick.
---
Namjoon has never been a lucky man.
---
Jungkook began to worry as an entire week and a half passed without his hyung making an appearance. With no way to really reach him, Jungkook went to what he assumed were desperate measures.
---
A few Naver searches later, and he found himself at the fifth shelter in the city, asking kind workers if they’d seen a tall lanky man in his early twenties. None had, so he continued on. Shelter after shelter, sometimes repeating just to see if there was any change.
---
There never was.
---
Eventually, though, Jungkook quite literally stumbled upon Namjoon. He’d left a shelter and had been wandering when the rattling cough brought his attention to a dingy alley. His mother had always warned him to stay away from such places, but he had a feeling.
A feeling.
---
Namjoon was curled up in the very back of the alley, cheeks pale, but forehead burning to the touch. He shivered despite the general heat of the day and the brightness of the midday sun.
No matter what Jungkook tried, he couldn’t get Namjoon’s eyes to focus.
He struggled, but managed to get the elder situated on his back, arms looped under Namjoon’s long, thin legs. The matching arms dangled limply over Jungkook shoulders, swaying back and forth with each step the younger took.
What worried him most was the ragged breathing against his neck. It was too hot and too dry.
---
The fever, Jungkook discovered, was almost 38.5°C. After some internet research, he started to treat the problem, running to the store a couple of times to get items he needed.
Jungkook was the youngest in his family. He’d never had to treat someone else’s fevers before. His mother had always fixed him up when he was ill. This was new territory and he was frightened of messing it up.
---
Jungkook called Yoongi only to tell him he wasn’t feeling well and couldn’t come into work that day.
---
Yoongi heard the coughing and wheezing over the phone at the same time Jungkook was speaking. He wasn’t an idiot.
---
“Be careful, Jungkook.”
“I will, Hyung. Don’t worry about me.”
---
Namjoon woke the next day around lunchtime. He was sore and queasy and parched, throat sandpaper with each swallow. Jungkook was right there, glass of water and a measure of cough syrup at the ready.
Both were taken with little fight, the biggest problem being the need to sit up before drinking. Namjoon was sore all over and any movement was difficult.
---
“Why did you bring me here, Jungkook?”
“You could have died out there, Hyung.”
Namjoon went quiet for a moment. Jungkook glanced around, thinking maybe the elder had fallen asleep. That seemed to be all he did the entire two days through--sleep or stare at the wall. He’d only recently lost the worst part of the fever, but was still staying on Jungkook’s couch.
Regardless, Jungkook could see that Namjoon was still very much awake, watching the other’s back. Namjoon seemed startled at the appearance of his face and those bright, bright eyes. But it didn’t seem to keep him from saying what was on his mind.
“That might have been better, Kid.”
---
Jungkook, of course, had to return to work. He begged Namjoon to be there when he returned and, against his better judgement, Namjoon complied.
Jungkook found him splayed out on the couch when he got home and breathed out a heavy sigh of relief. He checked Namjoon’s forehead to see if the fever had persisted, tutting lightly when he found the skin still uncomfortably warm.
---
Namjoon woke to gentle shakings and apologies, followed by promises of warm soup.
---
He stayed after that, too. Borrowed Jungkook’s shower and a razor the next day, cleaning himself up. He didn’t fit into any of the youngers clothes, so he washed his own, lounging around in the apartment in ratty boxers while the machines whirled.
By the time Jungkook returned, Namjoon was leaning against the arm of the couch, staring at the wall. Any clothes he didn’t have on currently were folded neatly on the opposite end of the couch.
He hadn’t wanted to put them back in his bag to get all wrinkled just yet.
---
Jungkook picked them up on his way past the other, not even pausing to watch his reaction. The clothes were deposited in a drawer of his dresser, and that was all there was to it. Namjoon hadn’t followed him physically, but he turned his head to watch where Jungkook went, frown tugging at his lips.
He didn’t question it, but he didn’t react past the expression either.
---
Namjoon stayed after that as well. Jungkook would wake him in the mornings before he left for work, opening the curtains in the living room and allowing the bright morning light from the window to hit Namjoon’s face. There would be soft complaints, but Jungkook would just laugh them off and move on, leaving Namjoon to fend for himself in the apartment.
---
The first week, he threw up almost every day while Jungkook was gone. He ate too much and was still a little feverish and he kept flushing puke and bile down the toilet. It was miserable and Jungkook found that Namjoon seemed to have no appetite come dinner.
He still nibbled on toast and crackers, but didn’t really eat anything substantial until that week and his illness had passed.
---
“When do you want me to leave, Jungkook?”
“Leave?” a pause. “Why would you leave? You have a drawer in my dresser. You have a toothbrush in the bathroom. Of course you’re staying.”
Namjoon opened his mouth to argue, but found he had nothing solid to say, so he closed his mouth again and shifted around on the couch for a short while, unsure what to do after that. He settled for staring at the TV when Jungkook turned it on and, eventually, falling asleep leaning against the arm of the couch.
---
Namjoon woke up laying down with his head on a pillow and blankets tucked in around him nice and neatly. He didn’t question it, assuming he knew.
It’s not the first time this happened to him since he arrived in the apartment.
---
Spring ended with Namjoon feeling better overall and generally being in good spirits. Jungkook got him a new pair of jeans and a T-shirt to help him through the summer. He kept the curtains open to make the room bright and lively.
Namjoon didn’t need to open his eyes and see the sky to know it was sunny outside. He could tell by the feeling of the sun against his skin each morning Jungkook spread the curtains wide.
---
Summer gave way to fall and Jungkook invited Namjoon to the restaurant after it closed for the night--early for this special occasion. Namjoon wasn’t quite sure what he was walking into, but it involved the other man who worked there.
“Yoongi-ssi--,”Namjoon stopped when the other raised a hand.
“Hyung is fine,” sharp and uninviting, but Namjoon didn’t seem to care about the tone.
---
He’d heard worse tones for worse words. This wasn’t anything to be afraid of.
---
“Happy Birthday, Namjoon-hyung.”
“How did you know it was my birthday, Jungkook?”
“You don’t remember? You told me about a year ago,” nervous laughter. “It’s not much, but Yoongi and I thought we’d surprise you. Mine was on the fourth, but I waited so we’d be able to celebrate together.”
“It was all the kid’s idea, Namjoon-ah. Don’t let him fool you. The only thing I did was lock up and keep cooking.”
---
Namjoon turned twenty-five in the restaurant, sitting on a counter and swinging his legs back and forth. Jungkook and Yoongi bustled around, finishing up the final touches to the large meal.
They ate lamb skewers and side dishes and drank soju until they felt like bursting.
Jungkook and Namjoon walked home clinging to each other for support, arms and legs too tangled up to tell whose belonged to who.
It was even more complicated when they finally got into the apartment, giggling and pushing on each other and trying to untie shoelaces with fumbling fingers.
---
They woke up the next morning on Jungkook’s bed, fully clothed, jackets included, and tangled in an uncomfortable position, blankets kicked off the side or somehow draped over the other pieces of furniture in the room.
All of Jungkook’s left shoes were lined up against the dresser. (No one knew how they got there or which one of them did it.)
Jungkook woke first and his movements caused the elder to stir. He hadn’t meant to wake Namjoon, but in this situation, it was more or less impossible.
---
“Why am I only wearing one shoe, Jungkook?” a pause. “And why is it your shoe?”
---
They never did figure out how it had happened. Namjoon was bright, but even that stayed a mystery to him.
(They did, however, refer to it as the Mistaken Shoe Incident, and would later bring it up in conversation. It was a ‘You Had To Be There’ situation, so few people found the story funny.)
---
By the time Christmas morning arrived, Namjoon had found a small job at a local bookstore. It was shelving and running the register and it didn’t pay well, but it was a job. He insisted on at least paying for one bill with his meager paycheck, if only to feel less like the freeloader he was.
Jungkook could argue until he was blue in the face, but Namjoon had his mind set on his decision.
By the time Christmas morning arrived, Namjoon was very much used to curling up in the queen sized bed in the apartment’s only bedroom.
By the time Christmas morning arrived, Namjoon was accustomed to being woken up by bright, bright sunlight streaming in through the windows as Jungkook pulled the curtains open. He’d stumble to the kitchen each day for a cup of already made coffee and a kiss on the cheek on the lips on the forehead on the bridge of his nose before Jungkook would rush off to work, clutching a piece of toast, fruit, or a granola bar in his hands.
---
But today was Christmas morning.
---
There was no bookshop to stock. No lamb skewers to roast.
There were no curtains being pulled open to reveal bright light or coffee waiting in the pot for him.
Instead, there was a young man curled loosely next to Namjoon, eyes sleepy, but no less bright, reflecting the colors of the Christmas lights they had hung in the bedroom.
---
“Merry Christmas, Hyung.”
“You didn’t have to get me anything, Jungkook. You’ve done more than enough.”
“It’s not much, I promise!”
“...Kid, is this a gift card?”
“Yes.”
“To the skewer shop?”
“...yes.”
---
(Yoongi though Jungkook’s present was really really stupid.)
---
(Namjoon thought the present was really really sweet.)
---
(Jungkook is just bad at giving gifts.)



Chapter End Notes
A fever between 103°F (39.4°C) and 106°F (41.1°C) is considered a high fever and can come with hallucinations. Namjoon’s was registering just under that.
And, hello. I have a degree in environmental biology. Just wait until the next chapter goes up. :)
My first year of college, I short term (two weeks at the end of the year) roomed with a foreign student from Spain. She partied every night and came back drunk with her friends at like, 2 AM, and woke me up.My last day of finals, I woke in the morning to find every single one of my right shoes lined up in front of my dresser, and every one of my left shoes lined up in front of hers. They were in height order and I did not know what to do.So, I shoved them under my bed.She did not remember anything in the morning.

Chapter Notes
This is it! The end! I hope you’ve enjoyed it so far and like this chapter just as much as the previous ones.There’s a lot more to deal with here, so it’s longer than the rest, I think. At least it seemed like it while I was writing it. I know Jungkook’s chapter (which is one of the shortest) was only 14 pages. This one has 38, ahahahaThis chapter was, by far, the hardest to write. I struggled from time to time and didn’t think I’d get it done, but here it is! Right on time!Part of the struggle involved my newly adopted dog deciding she wanted to be pregnant and have a litter of seven puppies on 12/21. All I wanted to do was play with them and look at them and coo over their tiny paws and noses and tails and butts. (Such tiny little butts!!!) (But their paws. My good golly gosh darn gosh, you should see their paws.)They’re two weeks old now and their eyes are open my god I wish I could bottle up the cuteness. I would make a fortune.Also, there are no solid relationships between the boys in this chapter. None of them are paired together or end up together and anything you think you see is just friends being friends.Thank you for reading and sticking with me!PS: There’s sex mentioned again and I don’t know what happened at all. Jimin’s chapter had it and it all went downhill from there and I just wanted it to stop but it wouldn’t.PSS: There maybe might be a short epilogue that gets put up here in a few days? And by that I mean, there will definitely be a short epilogue that gets put up here in a few days. It’s already written. I’m just waiting a couple of days to space it out. Mostly for my own emotions sake because crying for some reason???

Namjoon kept the job at the shoestore until just after Christmas. When the holiday rush ended, he was let go and forced to look for other means of income.
A florist's shop came after, but he was pitifully inept at that job. He tore roots and bent stems and overwatered to the point of drowning the sales stock.
After that, there was a rush of convenience stores, gas stations, car washes, and coffee shops. He was never given the chance to stay for more than two or three paychecks, but they kept him in the apartment.
---
It’s the end of winter before he gets anything more stable than that. He manages to keep a receptionist position until the following fall. But the company is doing cut backs and they no longer need someone just to be a receptionist when they can use a nurse for the same job.
---
Namjoon turns twenty-three reading a book on cake decorating in the library. It doesn’t pique his interest as much anymore, not even the chapters on icing tips or flowers. He gives up before he learns how to make daffodils out of buttercream and, instead, reads up on how to take care of hamsters.
Not that he'll ever get a hamster, but. Hey. The information might be helpful to have one day.
---
The landlord lets Namjoon stay until the middle of January, then he has to turn him out. There are other potential tenants for the small apartment, and Namjoon hasn't paid rent since October.
Namjoon packs his duffel and heads out, bundled in whatever he feels will keep him the warmest.
---
He finds his way to a couple of shelters, but inevitably doesn't stay long in any of them. One gives him a free physical examination and he finds out he's well underweight for his age and height.
The prescription is to eat more and eat healthy and take vitamins regularly.
Namjoon almost laughs at the physician.
But it’s not the man's fault.
He’s just doing his job.
---
Another shelter gives him a few new pieces of clothes. A not-quite-new pair of shoes and coat. Some donated gloves. He appreciates it, but doesn’t stay to hear their religious sermon the next morning.
What kind of god would stand by and watch as a child is thrown out into the cold? Namjoon doesn’t think he can believe in a god like that.
---
Namjoon has never sucked a man's dick before, but he gives it a try before the end of February. He's clumsy and there's too much spit and he gags to the point of almost puking up bile around the flesh.
But the man pays him and Namjoon spends the coldest part of the night in a cheap motel with an extra cheese pizza.
---
The food was greasy and his stomach couldn't handle it, so he throws it back up by morning, clutching the rim of a dingy white motel toilet.
It certainly doesn't taste as good coming up as it did going down, but at least he got to taste it in the first place.
---
Namjoon falls into the act more often than he would ever admit. It becomes somewhat easy to recognize the type of people who would be willing to pay for a blow job in an alley in the dark, even if it's given to them by a man.
His hair is long enough they can pretend he’s a girl with a bob if it makes them feel any better about it. They grab it and pull enough that he’s sure most of them imagine it.
Besides, the men he finds are usually at least a little drunk.
---
It’s ‘somewhat easy’ to tell because there are times Namjoon reads the people wrong. He asks and gets punched or berated and, once, he gets chased down relentlessly into an alley four blocks away and kicked until he bruises across his body and his ribs hurt each time he breathes.
He gave it a good thirty minutes before finding a different person, sucking a dick with bruised and bloody lips, and curling up in a motel bed to try and get some semi-comfortable rest on sheets and blankets that smelled of cheap detergent and mothballs.
He doesn’t heal up for two weeks.
---
Once, he asked an off duty cop.
He's never run so fast in his life.
It would have been exhilarating if it hadn’t been so scary.
---
Namjoon turns twenty-four sucking cock for cash. He sleeps in a motel and realizes it's his birthday when he checks out and sees the date on the front desk.
He reads the book on cake decorating with mild disinterest and gives up by the third chapter.
Instead, he finds a couple on STD’s and other sex related diseases. He reads them and becomes just a little more nervous than he was before.
Perhaps he should have read these earlier.
---
Later, the next time Namjoon is in a shelter, he makes sure to nonchalantly stuff the free condoms they offer into his pockets.
They make him feel a little bit safer, if nothing else.
---
Winter is cold. It hits early, rearing its ugly head long before the end of November. Namjoon can't seem to get warm no matter what he does.
He jokes with other homeless people that he doesn't remember what warm feels like. Or was it a taste? A smell?
They find it amusing. He gets a few chuckles.
---
Even though he's more skilled with his tongue and mouth Namjoon still often gets nervous asking strangers if they'd like their cock between his lips for a few thousand.
It's no surprise that he's nervous now.
---
It's early February and the man is pretty attractive, so that should have been Namjoon’s first clue. No one who looks that good ever wants to unzip their pants in an alley unless they’re a politician. (And Namjoon is pretty sure this man isn’t in office.)
But it's cold and Namjoon would really like to be warm tonight. Maybe even get a shower and some convenience store ramen to choke down.
---
His second clue should have been the slightly rumpled appearance. The man was clearly stressed out over something, but even so Namjoon approaches cautiously.
---
“Excuse me, Sir,” his tongue comes out to wet his lips, leaving them shining in pale yellow street lamp light. His eyes stay half lidded, watching the stranger with what he thinks is a coy expression.
(Sometimes--sometimes--he practices in the motel bathroom mirrors. He thinks the expression looks alright, but he only has his memory of adult films he watched in secret back at his parents house to go off of.)
The man looks up and over, brows raising. There's a small questioning noise in the back of his throat, but he doesn't make to move away.
That surprises Namjoon as well, as he expects the man to be taken aback by his disheveled appearance. Then again, maybe this was what convinced Namjoon to continue with his line of questioning. No man who doesn't want his dick sucked would put up being spoken to by someone who looks like Namjoon.
“I was just wondering if you'd, uh,” he pauses, glancing down the alley beside them. When he looks back, it's up through his lashes and he’s gesturing down toward the man’s crotch. “Would you like a little fun for just a bit of cash?”
The words are always clunky on his tongue. He's never been good at this part.
At least he got better at actually sucking dick. That's a plus.
But he’s coiling the wiry muscles in his legs, ready to bolt if the need arises.
The man, however, just stares. His mouth opens in the smallest ‘o’, going slightly slack. He doesn't make a move to approach, but does create a small concerned sound.
---
Namjoon pulls back, ready to apologize profusely, bow a lot, and get the hell out of dodge, but the man reaches out and grabs his arm before Namjoon can take half a step back.
“How old are you?”
Namjoon swallows, twisting his wrist in the other’s grip. The man lets go immediately and Namjoon steps back. The stranger doesn’t close the distance, staying where he is. He lets the gap stand, brows still up. The hand that had gripped Namjoon gently reaches up to fix at his own hair, trying to smooth out the static and frizz. His gloves don’t seem to be helping the situation, but he seems to suddenly care about how he looks.
Namjoon doesn’t get it. He’s sucked the cocks of worse looking guys. It never really matters what the men look like, so long as they’re willing to pay.
---
Regardless, Namjoon hadn't expected the question. It's a strange one. He's sure he doesn't look that young, not with a bit of stubble on his chin and neck. The last time he shaved was a few days back when he bought a cheap razor and rented a motel room after sucking a couple of dicks behind a bar.
The man couldn't think he was that young.
Namjoon swallows. “Twenty-four,” it sounds wrong to say. Like, maybe, the man wanted someone younger and that he was too old to suck his cock.
It certainly surprised Namjoon when the man responds again. It’s, like many other things concerning this stranger, not what he expected.
---
There was a gentle smile on the stranger's face and he held his hand out toward Namjoon. “I’m Seokjin. Hyung to you, if you'd like. And I don't want you to do anything like that. How would you like a warm meal and a place to sleep tonight?”
Namjoon doesn't argue.
How could he with an offer like that?
---
Seokjin pays for Namjoon’s bus fare and doesn't ask his name until they're almost to the stop.
“That's a nice name, Namjoon. Mind if I call you Joonie?”
Namjoon shrugs. His mom used to call him that, but if it's someone who's offering him food and shelter from the cold, he can call Namjoon anything at all and he wouldn't mind.
“Joonie it is, then. I think you’ll like the house. It’s nice.” He still smiling, but it’s a reassuring one. Namjoon can’t deny that he likes it.
It does the job and he relaxes in the movement of the bus.
---
It’s been a long while since he’s been in a vehicle. He’s reminded, suddenly, that he used to fall asleep in the car on the way to the store and on the bus when he was going to and from school.
He almost sleeps here, eyes impossibly heavy. But he doesn’t, keeping alert enough to pay attention to which streets they take.
---
“No, but like. Listen. No, listen I know you’re allergic, but hear me out.”
Namjoon can hear the voice even before he gets into the house. It’s deeper than his own or Seokjin’s, and it sounds a little whiny, but it seems approachable. Like it belongs to someone he wouldn't be afraid to invite into an alley. (He shakes he thought out. That’s not why he’s here.)
(He thinks, at least.)
Namjoon manages to hear most of the conversation over the sound of keys jingling and the door opening and the processes the follow.
“Bees are just our friends, Chim. They don’t want to hurt us. They think we’re flowers and just want to try and help us make baby flowers--.”
“Seeds,” another voice. A little annoyed, but also sounding pretty fond at the same time. (How he manages, Namjoon doesn’t know.)
“Yeah, baby flowers. And they think we’re flowers until they bump into us a lot and realize we’re not!”
“Yeah, but they’re still assholes with sharp asses. I don’t want them anywhere near me.”
“You might be thinking of wasps which, for the most part, are pretty terrible. They’re like that one uncle that comes to every family holiday by obligatory invite but you think they might have gone to jail or murdered someone, but you’re not sure. They always linger around you too long and touch you a little too much and it’s terrible and no one wants to tell you what happened with him when you ask, they just tell you that’s how he’s always been.”
“What kind of family events did you attend?”
“But bees?” the first continues as though he hadn’t been asked a question. “Bees are that one cousin that’s your age and you both just sit in the living room on your phones talking to your friends from school and then that one annoying aunt comes in and complains about how ‘kids these days don’t interact and just play games on their phones’ and when she leaves, the two of you look at each other and roll your eyes before going back to your friends.”
There’s an exasperated sigh from the second voice.
Namjoon finally has his shoes lined up by the door. He doesn’t take the time to count how many pairs are sitting there, but he knows it’d be a big number. Seokjin takes his coat to hang up on a free hook and Namjoon is almost reluctant to relinquish it, but he does.
---
“That’s Taehyung and Jimin. They were both born in ninety-five. You’ll get used to them, I promise. Tae comes on strong, but he’s incredibly bright. He has trouble getting his point across, but just give him a chance and let him organize his thoughts as he talks, and he’ll eventually makes sense. Ask questions if you need to and he’ll get around to explaining better. And Jimin can be shy, but he’ll warm up to you quickly, I'm sure.”
Namjoon swallows and nods. He’s not quite sure what Seokjin means by ‘you’ll get used to them.’ He’s not going to be staying long, is he? Just for the night to get a shower and dinner. Then he’ll probably be put back out on the street. Hospitality only goes so far for people like him.
He’s contemplating which alley to sleep in the following night when there’s a startled sound and Namjoon looks up from the shoe rack he’d inadvertently been staring at, looking blankly at a new face.
---
The kid has to be younger--he’s still got a tiny bit of baby fat clinging to his cheeks--and his eyes are bright and brown and doed. He’s staring at Namjoon like a deer trapped in headlights, a cracker hanging precariously from his lips, hand trapped frozen in the air halfway back down to the plastic package in his grip.
It takes a few, quiet moments of staring before the kid starts to eat the cracker, pulling it in with his lips and teeth, slowly devouring it with tiny nibbles, not bothering to use his hands. Namjoon sees him swallow too quickly to be safe.
And then the kid is off, charging out of the hallway on socked feet, slipping once or twice in his haste to round a corner. Only when he’s out of view does Namjoon hear him speak.
“Taehyungie-hyung! Jimin! Seokjin-hyung brought home another stray! And he doesn’t have Hobi-hyung’s cake! Someone text Yoongi-hyung so he knows in advance!” There’s clattering and rushing (and a shout of ‘Jeon Jungkook, that’s Jimin-hyung to you!’) and, soon, Namjoon sees two heads pop out from a side room, watching him down the hallway.
Seokjin waves them away and they disappear again.
“That was Jungkook. He’s the youngest--born in ninety-seven. He can be a handful, but he’s a real sweetheart. Pretty funny too and really likes making people laugh if given the chance. Don’t take up his offer to arm wrestle. You won’t win.” Seokjin is smiling, so Namjoon takes it as a joke and manages a nervous chuckle.
“Let’s get you something to eat, yeah? I hope that wasn’t the last pack of crackers. You’ll need something easy on the stomach.”
------
A short while later, the front door opens and the tell tale sound of snow stomping off of shoes rings through the house. From the kitchen, Namjoon can hear three pairs of feet bounding from various places in the building, heading for where Namjoon knows the front hallway was.
Seokjin merely glances up from the stove, smiling stupidly for a moment before laughing as the shouting starts.
The three younger men had started singing happy birthday, screaming the words loudly and ad-libbing some parts here and there, each doing their own variation. With the sheer volume, Namjoon couldn't make out which man was singing which addition, but it didn't really matter in the end.
There was a lot of laughing toward the end, and a new voice shouting for his immediate release (along with the need for ‘air, Jungkook. Air.’), putting ‘thank you’ in every so often.
---
“You must be our stray, huh,” one of the newcomers said, moving into the kitchen and setting a cardboard box on the table. The man surveyed Namjoon for a moment before nodding toward Seokjin. “Where’d you find this one, Hyung?” laughing lightly as he moved toward the hall again. He clearly hadn’t expected or wanted a response. Seokjin doesn’t give him any.
The second man appeared a few minutes later, grinning too much and wearing an odd assortment of party staples. Three pointed hats in various colors and patterns, a crumpled paper blower in his mouth, and a bunch of cheap, plastic necklaces. He held the smile even after seeing Namjoon.
When he gets to the table, he reaches to struggle one of the hats off, immediately settling it on Namjoon’s head. He thinks about pulling away, but he’s a guest, and the hat doesn’t look dangerous. The elastic feels strange on the underside of his chin, but he doesn’t make to remove it.
“There,” spoken around the plastic spout of the party blower, “You look a little more put together now. I'd give you one of the necklaces, but I don't have any to spare.”
“You're wearing at least twenty, Hoseok.”
“Exactly. None to spare.”
There’s laughter, and then Hoseok turns to leave. Seokjin tells him to hurry up because the soup will be done soon and he’s not going to wait on him to change to serve it.
“But it’s my birthday!”
“And I’m the chef! Be on time for your reservations or no food for you!”
“I live here! There are no reservations.”
“Do you want the seaweed soup or not?”
---
Namjoon isn’t quite sure what to make of this entire thing. The six of them are very easy going in their own ways. They joke and punch and tease and not once does Namjoon see any of them get angry or irritated by the words or actions of another.
He doesn’t remember a time when that was ever a thing for him. Not even when he lived with his parents.
It’s strange.
---
He’s given a chance to freshen up before dinner (without the risk of his ‘reservations’ being canceled). Seokjin gives him a towel and a brand new razor from under the sink and tells him to use anything he finds in the cabinets.
When Namjoon comes back out, he’s clean shaven and smells of someone’s aftershave. He had been shaving for a little under a year when he’d been kicked out from his home. He had still been knicking his chin and neck and drawing blood. His father’s aftershave stung every time Namjoon used it.
He hadn’t had access to the stuff since living on his own. It wasn’t particularly necessary and he wasn’t going to waste the money.
What he’d used today hadn’t burned at all. He was a little confused, but he wasn’t going to argue. He figured the less pain he felt, the better.
---
Namjoon comes back to the kitchen to find all six men gathered up, five of them sitting around the table comfortably. Seokjin glances over from the stove, smiling brightly and gesturing to the empty spot closest to Namjoon. “I was just about to put the soup down. Come on. Sit.”
It’s not up for debate, he knows. But he also figures that, if he denied the request, that would be alright, too.
---
The pot is steaming and smells like childhood.
It tastes like jumping off the swingset for the first time. Like taking his stuffed lion on adventures in the backyard. Like catching bugs and frogs and lizards and having his mother find them in the pocket of his tiny denim overalls.
Namjoon keeps his head down when he eats. He’s not crying. That’s not it at all. He’s just--it’s hard to explain.
---
He’s pretty sure he’s happy, but it’s such a foreign concept, he’s not quite sure if he remembers what it feels like.
---
He burns his tongue because he doesn’t blow on the spoon, but he doesn’t care. It tastes amazing. Seokjin and Hoseok watch him carefully while he eats, both trying to gauge whether he could eat more or if it would be more harmful than helpful. Every so often, they glance at each other and debate wordlessly, brows and eyes moving to convey their thoughts.
Eventually, Hoseok puts another half ladleful into the bowl without speaking or asking. Namjoon hesitates, but continues eating as though it didn’t happen.
---
Conversation at the table flows easier than Namjoon expects it to with him there. Taehyung really carries it, but he’s engaging. Namjoon catches himself almost adding something in every once in awhile, but stops short each time. This isn't his home. This isn’t his family.
It’s not his place to add anecdotes or facts he’s picked up in books.
Hoseok talks easily as well, and each time he starts up, Taehyung quiets down. Namjoon isn’t sure if it’s a normal occurrence or because of the birthday, but he’s not going to ask.
---
It’s the birthday. Not that Taehyung is disrespectful on purpose. He just doesn’t realize sometimes. He just makes extra sure to be conscious of each housemate on their birthdays, though.
---
Jimin, as Seokjin predicted, is quiet through most of the meal. He steals glances in Namjoon’s direction and puts in a few words when he has something to add, but he doesn’t speak much.
Yoongi is surprisingly witty and a little more sarcastic than Namjoon had original thought he would be. The man seemed stoic at the beginning of the meal, despite his original introduction, but when the conversation started moving easily, he joined in with sharp, jabbing comments that did no apparent damage on the others.
Jungkook is talkative, but he seems to enjoy observing more. When he does speak, everyone listens and encourages the line of thought. None of them belittle anything that comes out of his mouth, even if he’s much younger than the rest.
---
It’s a strange thing to witness, but it seems everyone has respect when it comes to talking about their days. Talking about their weeks or their jobs.
Namjoon learns a lot about them, even from this one meal.
They’re all just so open.
---
Seokjin is an assistant baker. He started at the register after high school and worked his way up. At this point, he’s in charge of the bakery on the head baker’s two days off, and he gets to make his own recipes to test out. The house is never void of baked goods at any point during the year, and the residents are ‘forced’ to taste test all sorts of goodies. (The cake was only purchased from another bakery because Hoseok loves their coffee and chocolate pound cake and Seokjin hasn’t mastered it yet.)Yoongi does piercings and sells jewelry at a kiosk in the mall. He dabbles in art and sometimes manages to sell some designs to local tattoo artists for decent prices. There’s a second job at a record store at he likes more. His opinions on music seem pretty open, and if Namjoon had listened to anything other than what played on the stations at his jobs, he’d talk with Yoongi about it. But as it is, all he knows are the tunes of the top forty hits from the last eight years, and nothing more. And if the man likes record stores, those are probably not the songs he enjoys spending his time with.Hoseok teaches lessons at a dance studio. He specializes in children under seven, but sometimes helps out with older classes when the need comes up. He loves his younger kids though, and goes on and on about how getting the girls and boys to hold hands to practice is finally going well now that he had his annual Free Cootie Shot Day. (Taehyung was happy to lend him enough superhero bandaids for the event, Namjoon discovers. He also finds out Seokjin was more than willing to bake some healthy banana oatmeal cookies, which went over well, thanks to the chocolate chips hidden inside.)(Namjoon almost asks what a cootie shot is, but doesn’t have to as Taehyung mumbles about it being time for Jungkook’s booster. Jimin snickers and carefully pulls one of the youngest’s arms over, drawing two circles, tapping twice and reciting with Taehyung a quarter of a second behind “Circle, circle; dot, dot; now you’ve got your cootie shot.”
Jungkook squirms in his seat and wrinkles his nose up, pulling away when he’s given free reign of his arm once more.)Jimin is a receptionist at a doctor’s office and is taking nursing classes otherwise. It’s taking twice as long to get done because he can’t afford to be a full time student, but the office he works at has promised to hire him when he finally graduates. The older women that work there pinch his cheeks every day and try to force feed him more than his stomach can handle, but he loves them and affectionately calls all of them his mother's. (Yoongi chides and reminds him that he already has two mothers, and that Seokjin-hyung and Hoseok are probably really sad that Jimin found replacements.) (They’re only a little disappointed and slightly offended at the new information. Hoseok threatens a time out if the behavior continues. Seokjin suggests they take away Saturday morning cartoons.)Taehyung works the farthest from the house, doing animal and environmental shows at a local aquarium and zoo. The bus ride is a forty-five minutes each way. Even so, he goes on and on about the birds and sharks and octopi (which, Namjoon finds out, can also be called octopuses or octopodes) (Taehyung clearly adds that portion for Namjoon’s benefit because the rest of the table sighs) (it’s a mix of resignation and fondness which Namjoon finds oddly refreshing) and how ‘one of the rascals escaped and found its way into the clown fish exhibit.’ There were small children screaming about Nemo being eaten for hours following the situation. It would have been funny if Taehyung’s personal favorite fish hadn’t been a victim of the deadly assassination. (Taehyung’s words, not Namjoons.)Jungkook is a busboy at a restaurant a few blocks away. He gets to snack while he’s there and bring home leftovers. Recently, the owner has decided to let him try his hand at waiting tables and expediting. He’s excited, but nervous. The others congratulate him profusely on the somewhat promotion. Namjoon nods along, but doesn’t contribute.They don’t ask what he does. Namjoon assumes this is either because Seokjin somehow informed them all of how they met in the short times they haven’t been together, or they’re just respecting how quiet he’s been so far.
Or maybe they just know he doesn’t have a job. No one looks like this and has a job.
---
“Hyung tells us you and Hoseok are the same age?” Yoongi starts after he’s swallowed another spoonful of soup. It’s everyone’s second bowl with Namjoon as the exception. He politely refused when Taehyung asked. (Seokjin and Hoseok had shot the younger warning looks and Taehyung looked surprised and deflated to be receiving them.)
The prospect of throwing up became more and more viable with each spoonful he swallowed back.
Whatever the case, Namjoon glances up and over, slightly startled at the address. “I, uh--. Kind of. I was born in ninety-four, too. But in September. So I’m a little younger.”
Yoongi nods and shoves more of the now tepid meal into his mouth, humming around the spoon in the process.
“Ah, we’ll just be friends anyway,” Hoseok offers. “No ‘hyung’ needed. Hoseok or Hobi or--well, fuck. Anything is fine as long as I know you’re talking to me.” He’s smiling and Namjoon glances over to see it. He’s surprised, but tries not to show it, looking back down to his empty bowl and fiddling with the napkin in his lap.
“Alright. Then--then Namjoon is fine.”
“Sounds good to me, Joon-ah.” Namjoon doesn’t look up, but he can hear the smile.
---
It goes a little quiet after that, everyone just finishing up their second bowls. Jungkook dumps a third ladleful into his before Seokjin rises to work on putting the leftovers away. Between the seven of them, there’s only enough for one serving, which Seokjin sticks into a tupperware with a green label and slides into the fridge.
Taehyung groans and mutters about it not being fair that Hoseok gets special treatment today and tomorrow, but Seokjin reminds him that on his birthday, he got the leftovers for the next day and it quiets the younger.
The cake comes next, delivered with glasses of milk. Seokjin puts a plate in front of Namjoon. The slice is more of a sliver than anything. Thin and will barely be three bites, if that. The glass of milk is bigger, full sized and full to the brim. Everyone else has regular sized slices and glasses. Namjoon doesn’t miss either fact. There’s a candle in the slice that’s placed in front of Hoseok and Taehyung turns the lights off before running back to the table. Happy birthday is sung again, this time at a more acceptable volume and with fewer adlibs along the way.
Namjoon doesn’t sing along because he’s afraid he’s forgotten the words.
---
With dinner and dessert finished, Namjoon is surprised to see the men bustling about, cleaning dishes and tables and counters. They all seem to know where to go and what to do without talking about it. There’s a system and Namjoon doesn’t quite understand it.
What he does notice more specifically is Seokjin doesn’t get up to help.
“Whoever cooks doesn’t clean up the mess,” he explains, standing up and pushing his chair in.
“Which basically means Hyung never cleans,” Jungkook clarifies, scrubbing the table down with a damp, soapy sponge.
Seokjin snorts, then gestures for Namjoon to follow him out of the kitchen and, after a moment, Namjoon does. Before he leaves, though, Seokjin glances back to the kitchen, watching everyone moving around, doing assigned tasks and cleaning duties. He smiles lightly.
“I’m going to find Namjoonie something to wear. I think your clothes will fit him best, Tae. I’ll be careful what I pick, I promise.” There’s an exaggerated nod in response. Namjoon’s surprised Taehyung didn’t speak up.
---
Taehyung’s too busy chewing an extra bite of cake he shoved in his mouth when no one was looking.
---
The clothes fit loosely, but Seokjin assumed they would. But at least the pants reach all the way down to his ankles, which is a plus. They’re pajamas and they’re comfortable and warm and Namjoon finds he quite likes them.
---
Once he’s dressed, they’re back in the living room. Namjoon sits on the edge of the couch, looking around the room, just a little timid.
Perhaps coming here was a bad idea. What if they were murderers? He couldn’t be sure they weren’t. He couldn’t be sure they didn’t want something from him.
No one gives up food and space for free.
---
It took another ten or so minutes for the rest of the household to make their way back into the living room. Jungkook ducked out the front door with a bag of trash clutched in his hand, but returned soon after.
Namjoon shifts awkwardly, still perched at the edge of the couch. He’s suddenly worried he’ll take up too much space here, so he keeps his arms tucked close to his body, lips pursed into a tight line and eyes trained to the floor.
He can feel the stares.
---
No one is staring. They’re all getting comfortable and situated around the room.
---
“My parents got divorced when I was nine,” one of them started suddenly. Namjoon tilted his head up to see who it was.
Taehyung’s got his legs crossed over one another in his spot on the floor. His elbows are on the coffee table and he’s watching Namjoon with a comfortable expression. “My dad moved far away and I lived with my mom. She got remarried four years later. The guy hated me for taking her attention, and there was lots of verbal abuse. Like. Big time verbal abuse,” there’s a small shift and a shrug. “I ran away when I was fifteen. Now I’m here. I don’t know if my mom looked for me. I loved her, but I couldn’t deal with it anymore. Sometimes I think about looking her up, but I’m afraid she’s not okay, so I don’t.”
Namjoon’s lips parted. He wasn’t sure what he planned to say, so he closed his mouth again, just letting his brows furrow.
---
“My family just didn’t really care. They had me because they thought it would keep their marriage together, but that’s the worst reason to have a kid, trust me” Yoongi stretches his arms above his head and the movement almost sends him toppling over backwards. Namjoon can almost see the other’s eyes swimming for a moment.
Yoongi would have fallen if Hoseok hadn’t reached out and gripped the front of the elder’s sweater, pulling him back into a proper sitting position. The action was seamless, as though it were something that happened often. Hoseok barely had to look to know what was happening and how to stop it.
“There was a car crash,” Hoseok starts quietly once he’s gotten Yoongi sitting steady again. His hands rest in his lap and Yoongi pats one of Hoseok’s thighs before keeping his own hands to himself. “None of my relatives really wanted to take another kid in, especially one whose chosen career path was dance. I was sixteen and I’d spent the better part of nine years in dance studios, so I was good at it, but they wanted to take me in and have me be a doctor or lawyer or--or whatever. But I always shirked off on my studies to dance. Mom and Dad were fine with it, but my aunts and uncles? Not so much.”
“We met at the Seoul train station,” Yoongi continues. “He was an idiot back then, too.”
“But we’re best friends?” Hoseok seems a little worried, as though he needs Yoongi to acknowledge and agree.
“Because it was winter, he didn’t have gloves, and I mistakenly bought him hot chocolate with what little pocket change I had left. I was an idiot back then as well, but I matured.” A pause. “But, yeah. I’m stuck with him. Too attached to the way he makes tea and coffee. No one else can make mine right.”
Hoseok snorts, but seems relieved. There’s a barely audible ‘if you say so, grandpa’, followed by snickering from Taehyung and Jungkook. Hoseok winds up sprawled across the floor after Yoongi shoves him to the side, but he starts laughing when he’s down there, so there’s no pain or injury involved.
Yoongi laughs just as easily, grin showing more teeth and gum than Namjoon expected. The grin stays even after he receives a quick kick in the leg from one of Hoseok’s feet when the younger of the pair sits back up.
---
Namjoon shifts, wetting his lips and glancing around the room. He’s not sure if anyone will add more or if he’s expected to share.
He doesn’t really want to.
It’s hard to imagine telling his story, especially to strangers. He explained some here and there at shelters and to other people living on the streets, but it was mostly about The After. He’s never explained The Before. The Why. The How.
He mostly just tries not to think about it.
---
“I’ve only been here for, what? Two years?” Jungkook scratches at an ankle and sucks in a drink from the juice box in his hands. Taehyung had been complaining in the kitchen that the younger hadn’t asked before taking it, but Jungkook didn’t seem to care that much.
“My mother left my dad when I was thirteen. I stayed with him for three years before it got too unbearable.” There’s a bit of a shrug and Jungkook looks down to watch the fingers on his free hand fiddle with the hem of his shirt. “He wasn’t that good at holding his liquor, you know? And then I was on the streets for a while...”
Jimin reaches to rub a hand carefully over the younger's shoulder. “We patched you up, though, didn’t we, Jungkook?”
“Yeah, Jimin. Got out of it with one scar,” a grin and he’s gesturing to his cheek.
Jimin scowls and grips the shoulder only a little harder. Enough to show irritation, but still good mannered and measured to an extremely careful degree, obviously aware of how physical retaliation could come off to Jungkook. “Jimin-hyung.”
“Yepp,” the grin doesn’t falter, but Jungkook does turn it toward Jimin, trying not to laugh the entire time.
Jimin just sighs.
---
“I just couldn’t stay there,” Jimin says after a quiet moment. He’s got his hands off of Jungkook, now, and they’re fisted in his sleep pants. He doesn’t look up at Namjoon, but doesn’t purposefully avoid him, just absentmindedly staring at his lap. His voice wavers for a moment, but comes back stronger as he continues. “I’m not going into details, which is all anyone needs to know.”
He looks up, then, blinking slowly. It’s clear from the silence in the room that that really is all they know.
---
Namjoon doesn’t turn his head to look at Seokjin, but he assumes he’s going to go next. It only seems natural. The quiet spans minutes, though. Everyone is patient and everyone is comfortable where they are. No one says anything. Namjoon gets antsy.
The clock shows fifteen minutes have passed before there’s a small breath.
“I never knew my parents. I grew up in the foster system, bounced from one family to another. When I turned eighteen, I aged out and got kicked out of the system. I had virtually nothing. So I tried to get myself something.”
Seokjin goes quiet and, after a moment, Namjoon turns his head to look at the man. Seokjin is smiling fondly at the room.
“I found a strange little family for myself. And it’s grown to this,” he gestures, “and I wouldn’t give it up. It’s mine and it’s ours and we found it together, Namjoonie. We’ve all come from something--some worse than others--but it doesn’t matter because this is where we are now. Together. Our pasts don’t define who we are now. We get to decide that on our own. We decide it every single day.”
---
“Oh.”
“Yeah.”
---
The rest of the evening is quiet and comfortable, really. The men who call the home theirs come and go from room to room. Hoseok opens presents as they’re brought to him. It’s an odd assortment, but he seems incredibly happy with each new edition. Namjoon doesn’t understand what any of the gifts have to do with each other or Hoseok, but he assumes that’s because he doesn’t know the man.
Or any of them, really. He knows parts of their past and more of their present, but nothing much else.
---
The dark comes early in the winter and one by one, the residents bid each other good night. There seem to be three rooms, with two people in each, if Namjoon is paying enough attention.
He’s trying not to get attached.
---
He’s trying so hard.
---
The idea of this family system is appealing to him. But, at the same time, he feels like an outsider. He feels like he doesn’t belong.
They all come from terrible things, it seems. Abuse and abandonment and death and apathy. Namjoon just comes from intolerance. It’s not quite the same thing. He doesn’t feel he deserves something like this.
He feels like he’s taking advantage, even if it’s just for one day.
---
And, really, even if he did deserve it, he wouldn’t know how to belong. They’ve all got places here. They all know each other so well. Namjoon would just be a wrench in the system, throwing it all out of whack.
He could very well ruin the entire thing--and then how could he forgive himself? Destroying two families?
---
Seokjin brings him blankets and pillows. There’s a glass of water settled on a coaster next to the couch. “If you’re here in the morning, which I hope you are, I’ll make you breakfast. How do pancakes sound? Or eggs? I can’t do waffles at the moment--Taehyung tried to follow a recipe he found online and ruined the nonstick coating. Nothing wants to come out of it now,” there’s a small shrug. He’ll get a new one eventually.
Namjoon swallows, reaching for the blankets Seokjin is holding. “I...it doesn’t matter. Whatever you want to make.” He shifts, settling the small pile in his lap and watching his fingers splay across the fabric.
He looks up when Seokjin doesn’t move away from him immediately. The elder is watching him, head tilted slightly and mouth drawn up at the edges. A very, very soft smile. “Alright, Namjoon,” a pause and then he gestures to the first door down the short hallway. “I’m in that room, if you need me. I share with Jungkook since no one wants to pry Yoongi and Hoseok from each other and Tae and Jimin are the same age. And because, sometimes, Kookie likes being babied and coddled because he’s just a big baby,” a fond laugh. “Don’t tell him I told you that. And, really. Don’t hesitate to knock. If you’d rather talk to someone else, that’s fine too. The left door is Yoongi and Hoseok, and the other two are at the end of the hall.”
Seokjin waits for some kind of response, which comes as a hesitant nod, and then he leaves, ducking into his room and closing the door quietly.
---
Namjoon doesn’t sleep much. He abandons the couch and lays on the floor between it and the coffee table. He’s fitful and shifting the entire night through. Rolls back and forth and can’t get himself really comfortable.
But he still gets woken in the morning by the smell of pancakes and quiet chatter from the kitchen. He sits up and glances around, confused and disoriented for the moment. His eyes land upon the youngest resident. Again, Jungkook looks caught in headlights. Namjoon understands it a little more now.
At least he thinks he does.
---
Jungkook was hit by someone he should have been able to trust.
There’s no reason he should expect any less than that from a stranger.
---
Namjoon offers a tight, nervous smile and slowly works to his feet, the blankets tumbling off of his body and pooling at his feet. “Uh,” he scratches at the back of his head. “Morning?”
Jungkook swallows around the straw of his juice box. (‘Taehying’s juice box,’ Namjoon thinks quickly.) (He’s not sure how he remembers that bit of information.) “Morning. Seokjin-hyung’s making pancakes and scrambled eggs. He said you never chose, so he made both.”
---
Namjoon sits at the same seat he did last night for dinner. His plate is noticeably less full than everyone else's, but Namjoon understands that it’s for the best. Seokjin is not being mean by serving Namjoon less, he’s being considerate.
Apparently, he’s plucked five other men from the streets (or something like that. Namjoon isnt sure to what degree of downtrodden everyone was at when Seokjin found them) (or if they found Seokjin). Seokjin seems to know a few things about how to handle a new houseguest in Namjoon’s state.
(And, besides. Jungkook did say ‘another’ stray when he saw Namjoon. This must be normal. He’s just another one in a long line of them.)
---
Even before the meal actually begins, everyone is chattering. It’s early and it’s a Tuesday. They all have work to get to at various points during the day. Jimin has an exam after lunch and he’s worried he’ll forget all about the calcaneus and mix up the cuboid and lateral cuneiform with the first and second.
Taehyung reminds him that the toe bone’s connected to the foot bone and Yoongi snatches Jimin’s glass of milk without looking up or over, seeming to know the younger was reaching for it. There’s cackling and some playful punching traded between Taehyung and Jimin, but no one seems to mind so long as nothing gets broken or spilled.
When it goes on for a little too long, Hoseok coughs at the same time he’s taking a sip of his banana milk, and the pair calm down, grinning at each other.
Yoongi replaces the glass of milk and Jimin takes a long drink, content with the taste.
Everyone else is just happy it didn’t wind up all over Taehyung and the floor.
Mostly the floor.
---
Namjoon silently observes while he eats. It’s interesting. Everyone is treating each other like family. Like actual brothers. Like how he used to treat his brat of a little sister. A quiet understanding of each other and a knowledge of how far is too far. How much is too much.
They seamlessly fit together somehow.
---
Namjoon mentally compares them to some strange sort of jigsaw puzzle. The kind where the pieces are irregular. At first glance, none of them seem like they fit. The colors don’t quite match and the edges are illformed and illogically created. But once it’s been painstakingly put together, the pieces all fit seamlessly and the picture surfaces.
This whole situation is strange.
But he’s working to piece it together.
---
One by one, everyone heads out.
Taehyung is first to leave. It’s seven and he starts work at eight. He should get to the aquarium with fifteen minutes to spare, barring any trouble with public transportation and bad roads due to the weather. Hoseok tells him he should have left much earlier for the weather. Taehyung grumbles about how some people need to stop nagging.
(He was five minutes late for work, but vowed to Never Ever Ever tell Hoseok.)Yoongi is next out the door, mumbling about picking up an extra half-shift at the record store, so he’ll be missing dinner. Seokjin tells him the meal will be in the fridge and tosses him a bag of pretzels for a midday snack. There’s grunted acknowledgement and he’s gone.
Jimin chases after him in his house slippers, shouting about Yoongi forgetting his scarf. When he comes back from his successful mission, Hoseok has extra slippers sitting by the door, lined up for Jimin to slip his wet feet into, now wet slippers being placed at the top of the shoe rack to dry.Jimin leaves at eight with a backpack, a small lunch, and a barrage of ‘good luck’s and ‘you’ll be fine’s. He laughs nervously and mumbles something about needing more than luck. Jungkook stops him long enough to slip a juice box into Jimin’s lunch bag. “For luck, Hyung.” There’s laughter and Jimin leaves. He’ll be at work until eleven, and then have his exam.Hoseok and Jungkook leave together around a half hour later, promising they’ll be back for dinner, but will text or call if something comes up. Hoseok passes Jungkook’s job on the way to the studio, so they always go together when their schedules line up. Seokjin tells Jungkook he’ll do really well at waiting tables. Namjoon hears Hoseok even after the door closes-- “If anyone decides to be really fucking rude to you, just knit your brows together and say something like ‘I’m sorry. I’m new, I just started today’. They’ll feel like a dick and probably tip you pretty well. Maybe you could even tear up a little; I know you can cry on command.”
---
“I called off today,” Seokjin informs Namjoon, putting away the last of the breakfast dishes that didn’t get done prior to everyone needing to get ready for work. “Don’t worry, it’s not because of you,” it was, “I planned to do it anyway. Sometimes, it’s nice just to take an extra day off every now and again. Plus, it’ll give me time to make a shopping and to-do list for everyone.”
Namjoon nods, shifting in his spot on the couch. It’s the same one he sat in last night and no one stopped him this morning, so he assumes it’s fine. No one claimed it to be theirs or complained about him sitting in it, so it must be fine.
(He doesn’t understand the concept of being able to just--to call off and be okay with it, though. When he had jobs, he’d come in every day, sometimes early, just in case he could start sooner. He’d linger and finish his last task for as long as he could, just so he’d get an extra minute or two of pay. The fact that Seokjin can just--can willy-nilly call out of work is amazing. He almost sits there with his eyes wide, but manages to rope in the surprise.)
Seokjin smiles. “Would you like to take a bath while I do my own thing? Yoongi has some bath bombs I’m sure he wouldn’t mind you using. It’s quite relaxing, really. We steal them every so often.”
And then replace them for holidays, but Seokjin keeps that part to himself.
“I--I don’t want to impose, Seokjin-hyung. I don’t want to--.”
“Nonsense. Come on; I’ll help you pick out a good one.”
---
The water is hot when Namjoon sinks in. It fizzes and pops in daffodil yellows, whites, and oranges and smells of mango, coconut, and pineapple.
He uses sandalwood and tangerine shampoo and soaks until the water is room temperature and his fingers resemble prunes.
---
Seokjin had found him new clothes to change into. Boxers and shorts and a thick sweater with sleeves long enough to leave his hands invisible and swimming in excess fabric.
He loves it more than he cares to admit and curls his fingers against the smooth material.
---
“I’m not quite sure how to get back to the city from here, Hyung” Namjoon admits from the doorway. Seokjin is in his bedroom, finalizing the chore list. He’s got a lot of planning to do--everyone has work and class schedules. Some are more consistent than others--Jimin, Taehyung and Seokjin himself always have the same hours, but the rest are variable. Seokjin never knows about Yoongi’s until a week in advance, and even then, the man picks up extra shifts as soon as they’re offered, no matter what the chore list says.
Regardless, Seokjin glances up from the desk, brows going up, then leveling back down. He offers a careful smile.
“I could get you a bus ticket, Joonie. Send you back to where I picked you up from,” a pause. Namjoon knows what’s coming. He can feel it. He knows what his answer is going to be.
“Is that what you want?”
---
The question startles Namjoon.
He’d been expecting an ‘or.’
‘Or would you rather stay?’ ‘Or would you like to live here?’ ‘Or would you like to become part of our family.’
The answer would have been ‘no.’ Namjoon didn’t want to ruin this delicate balance. The one where snacks are freely given when dinner is so much as hinted at being late. The one where running out the door and through the snow in house slippers because someone forgot a scarf is acceptable. The one where stolen juice boxes are good luck charms and well wishes fall off tongues as easily as leaves fall from trees in the fall.
Namjoon is positive he’d ruin it. He ruins enough things as it is. His own life, for example.
He doesn’t want to destroy this.
This is too perfect.
It’s too precious.
It’s heaven, if he’s ever seen it.
---
“What?”
“Do you want to go back to where I found you, Joonie? I’ll buy you a ticket, no questions asked. But only if that’s what you want.”
---
Namjoon swallows. His hand grips the doorframe tight enough that his knuckles turn white, hidden beneath the sweater’s sleeve.
It’s been a long time since anyone asked him what he wanted. It’s been a long time since anyone cared enough to ask.
---
“I--I…,” another swallow. He looks away. He’s not sure what he’s feeling. Conflicted, of course, and very confused. But otherwise, there’s too many emotions plowing through his body for anything to make sense.
“Why don’t you take a nap? I’ll set you up in Jimin’s bed--he washed his sheets yesterday, so they’ll be the cleanest--so I don’t disturb you while I do some things around the house. When you get up, we’ll have lunch and you can think it over.”
Seokjin is gentle with the words. They flutter from between his teeth like butterflies from flower to flower. Beautiful and soft.
Namjoon wonders if he could catch them in a jar.
---
He offhandedly remembers that that’s how butterflies die, and decides to simply nod his response.
---
Namjoon finds himself curled under a thin, grey duvet. The sheets are pale blue and soft. They smell like detergent and fabric softener, but mint as well. He assumes that’s Jimin--there had been bodywash and shampoo with that scent, so those must be his.
It’s calming, really.
Anything that doesn’t smell like dirt, puke, urine, or death is calming.
---
He falls asleep in a bed that smells clean and looks clean and feels clean for the first time in a long time.
(Motels aren’t exactly known for their cleanliness.)
He doesn’t dream, but he hasn’t really had any dreams in a while. He never expects any when he lays down.
---
Namjoon wakes up to Seokjin smiling down at him and pressing a light hand to his shoulder. “Come on. I made us some sandwiches.”
---
“I don’t know what I want,” Namjoon finally decides once they’ve finished eating. He’s trying to wash the taste of peanut butter out of his mouth with the rest of his glass of milk. “I...I don’t want to impose, but I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.”
“You’re not supposed to do anything but try, Namjoon,” Seokjin offers, shrugging a little bit. “Try to be happy or good or strong or--or whatever. It doesn’t matter. So long as you’re trying, that’s what matters. So pick something and go for it.”
---
Everyone started coming home, one by one. Some looked exhausted, and some not so much.
Jimin was first and assured Seokjin that he had definitely passed the test. He felt great about it.
Hoseok, next to arrive, immediately bemoans his feet and ducks into the bathroom to shower away sweat and the weird stickiness that came from working with small children.
Namjoon’s brows go up when Hoseok crashes onto the couch, skin still damp and hair dripping wet, and slides his legs and feet into Jimin’s lap without warning. With only a small laugh, Jimin begins rubbing and massaging, muttering the parts of the foot he touches as he works. He doesn’t seem disgusted or irritated in the slightest.
Jungkook arrives twenty minutes later and Jimin shushes him with a smile and a finger to his lips. Hoseok’s fallen asleep under the gentle ministrations and Jimin doesn’t want to wake him.
Taehyung shows up just before dinner’s going to be announced, and rushes to get a shower and throw his clothes into the machine--Namjoon got a quick look at the man as he ran past, and is sure that that’s the best choice he can make.
(Taehyung had unwanted presents from the animals he uses during his shows on his uniform and in his hair. It’s typically for the best that he showers when he gets home.)
---
Dinner is cold noodles and sides. Namjoon’s bowls are smaller and premade, while everyone else eats from the middle, taking whatever and how much ever they please. He feels slightly out of the loop, but there’s only so much he can do. It’s the best plan of action as far as eating is concerned.
Again, there’s conversation. It doesn’t seem to stop. Everyone takes turns telling stories of their days. Clarifying at confused sounds or questions.
Namjoon doesn’t say anything again. He sits quietly and eats, then plays with his napkin when he’s finished, continuing to listen to the talking around him.
He tries to find fault in it. In this system. He tries to find a problem with it all. Nothing can be perfect and nothing can be this good.
So where’s the imperfections?
Nowhere can be this kind of paradise.
---
Yoongi was right about being late. He strolls through the door as soon as Seokjin slides the white lidded containers into the fridge. There’s a tiny grunt, and Yoongi reaches for them when they’re held out to him, moving to throw a few into the microwave for the time being.
While it heats up, Namjoon watches everyone move about, taking up spots to work on cleaning the mess created during cooking and eating.
Seokjin opens his mouth, ready to invite Namjoon to the living room when Namjoon beats him to the punch.
“Is there...anything I can do to help? Clean up, I mean? I...I don’t know where anything goes, but I don’t mind helping with whatever?” It’s almost too quiet to hear, but.
---
Everyone stops for a moment, glancing over to him. The microwave starts to beep and it keeps going for a few seconds before Yoongi reaches to open it and stir the side dishes.
It’s quiet a little longer, just enough for the microwave to start spinning again.
“You can rinse and dry, if you’d like?” Jimin finally suggestions, hands buried in soapy dishwater. “Hyung usually helps me with that, but he’s about ready to eat.”
Namjoon wets his lips, then nods, standing up and walking over.
“I’ll put them away,” Taehyung assures him, gently patting at Namjoon’s back. “That way, you don’t have to worry where they go!” He’s cleaning up the counter and stove, scrubbing spots and spills and powders from the surface.
---
It’s strange to be doing this. It seems entirely too domestic. Namjoon hasn’t really washed dishes when it wasn’t part of his paycheck for a long while. He never had many dishes when he lived in his apartment. A couple pieces of silverware and a handful of plates and bowls, and that was it.
But, even then, he rarely used them.
And once he started motel hopping, there was no point in carrying dishes around, so they got left at the apartment. Anything he ate came in it’s own container--ramen or pasta sides. Boxed dinners that needed heating in a microwave.
Nothing that needed cookware, at the very least.
---
When everything is done, Namjoon isn’t quite sure what to do next. Most everyone else has already headed off.
Jungkook checks to see if he has to take the trash out and, when he doesn’t, he moves off to the living room to start the TV, calling for Hoseok about a show they like to watch.
Yoongi’s on the last of his food and Hoseok shouts back that he’ll be in as soon as Yoongi’s done eating. He doesn’t want the older to finish alone.
“Did someone sleep in my bed today?” Jimin inquires, glancing into the kitchen from the hallway, and then at Jungkook, almost accusing him. “The blankets are all messy.”
Namjoon opens his mouth, then closes it again. His cheeks and ears burn and he feels it working down his neck.
He suddenly finds the floor interesting.
---
Jimin watches him for a moment, unsure what to do. He feels bad, now that he realizes. Of course it would have been their stray. Seokjin was the only other one home today, and he has his own bed. There’d be no point in Seokjin using his.
---
“I told Namjoon to take a nap. I had some work to do in the living room and didn’t want to wake him. You were the one who cleaned your sheets most recently, so I sent him there,” Seokjin pats Jimin’s shoulder lightly, then moves to rest his hand on Namjoon’s arm, starting to lead him from the kitchen. “He looked much more well rested when he woke up.”
Jimin nods, offering Namjoon a shy smile, though the older doesn’t look up. “Well, I’m glad I could help you, then.”
That’s all. Jimin goes back to his room and Namjoon hears another TV start up. The tell-tale sounds of a game system powering on. Yoongi shoots past quickly, moving into the bedroom and telling the younger to ‘shove over and make room. I’m the best at this game and you don’t stand a chance.’
---
“How does this all work?” Namjoon asks a little later that night, playing with the straw to his juice box. He and Taehyung are sitting at the kitchen table. The younger has the next two days off and he’s working on scripting a new lesson and trying to figure out which animals he can use for it. Everyone else is either asleep or working quietly in their rooms. Namjoon hasn’t seen them in an hour or so.
It’s dark enough outside that the streetlights are the only thing illuminating the outside. There’s an almost eerie glow seeping in through the windows and Namjoon is glad the kitchen light is on.
“Well,” Taehyung starts, taking a long sip from his own box before holding it as one would a glass of expensive wine, “first, I have to decide what I want the kids to learn. And then I have to think about how I want to teach them. I have to figure out which animals are going to be the best at that job and if we have them trained to do what they need to do to--,” he stops, blinking over at Namjoon.
“Oh. You weren’t talking about this,” there’s loud nervous laughter, like he’s trying to brush the mistake off as a joke. As though he knew all along that’s not what Namjoon meant.
Namjoon just shrugs.
“Well. We share what we make,” Taehyung’s a little more serious now. Namjoon is, frankly, a little astonished that the younger can sound like this. “It’s a percentage I won’t get into, but it keeps it fair. Everything goes into an account that’s used to pay rent and bills and that kind of stuff. We use it for most of the groceries too. But special things that we don’t share aren’t taken from it. Like--like we all use different kinds of shampoo and conditioner? So we have to pay for that on our own.” Taehyung takes another sip, then sets the juice box on the table.
“It works for us, Hyung. We need each other. None of us could make enough to survive like we do alone, so we share what we have. It’s a communal kind of situation.” A pause. “Kind of like a wolf pack.” Another pause. “Yeah. I think that’s cool. We’re a wolf pack!”
He stays excited about it for the next twenty minutes, giving Namjoon more facts about wolves and pack structure than he thought anyone could know. Eventually, Namjoon figures he should help the kid get back to his lesson planning and goes to the living room to curl up on his blankets. He doesn’t put them on the couch and, instead, sleeps on the floor once more.
---
Namjoon is still asleep when Taehyung tells Seokjin the next morning about the question. Seokjin just ruffles Taehyung’s hair. “Answer him if he asks anything else, but don’t pressure him, Taehyung. We don’t know anything much more about him than his name and that he was on the streets. He seems like a great guy, but we still have to make sure,” Seokjin works to flatten and fix the hair he’d displaced. “Besides, he hasn’t decided what he wants yet.”
---
By the time Namjoon gets up the next day, everyone is already gone. Taehyung is sitting cross legged on the floor, four or so feet from the TV, with a large bowl of cereal settled precariously on his crossed legs.
The volume is down low enough that it didn’t wake Namjoon, but loud enough Taehyung could hear it. At first, Namjoon isn’t sure what it is, but upon further inspection, the show seems to be about animals. Some kind of African safari adventure, perhaps?
He sees a lion and a herd of elephants at the very least. Those are in Africa, right?
Namjoon’s pretty sure.
---
Namjoon makes every attempt to get up quietly. He doesn’t plan to distract or pull Taehyung’s attention away from the TV. All Namjoon wants is to go to the bathroom and--
“I left the cereal out on the table, Hyung” Taehyung doesn’t look back. Namjoon isn’t sure how he even knew he was awake.
(Taehyung saw Namjoon’s reflection in the TV screen, but he’ll never tell.)
(He’d rather Namjoon think he’s magic. Or telepathic. That’d be the better of the two options, maybe.)
“I wasn’t sure what kind you’d want to eat, so I actually just pulled down all the kinds we have right now. There’s milk in the fridge, and I got you a bowl and spoon,” a pause long enough for him to take a large bite, crunching down hard. He speaks before his mouth is empty. “I’m not really supposed to cook when I’m here alone. I’m not very good,” a contemplative hesitation. “Not that I’ll burn the place down or anything. It’s just that I might kill you with how bad it’d taste. That’s all. I broke Seokjin-hyung's waffle maker the last time I tried to make anything. But cereal isn’t cooking, so I figured it’d be alright.”
Namjoon hums in response, unsure how to really answer, and then goes to the bathroom. When he comes out, he makes himself a bowl of cereal, filling the bowl almost too full.
---
It’s not until he’s back in the living room that he realizes Taehyung seemed to know he’d fill the bowl too much and had taken the precaution to give him one smaller than his own.
Namjoon appreciates the gesture.
---
Namjoon watches the TV show from the couch. Taehyung turns the volume up and moves off to the side, but stays on the floor and closer than he should. Namjoon almost wants to say something, but it’s not his place.
He’s ‘Hyung’ only in name. These boys don’t really know him.
---
Namjoon doesn’t have anything to do to pass the time here. He could watch TV, but nothing really interests him, and the brightness of the screen gives him a headache.
Taehyung offers him a game system when breakfast is over, but Namjoon declines. He offers a coloring book and colored pencils, but Namjoon refuses that as well.
(“Are you sure, Hyung? Yoongi-hyung wouldn’t mind, I promise! He colors when he’s stressed, and they’re adult coloring books, so it’s not like all the pictures are puppies and kittens. They’re cool designs and it’s super detailed and, you know, it’s just--it’s cool.”)
---
Finally--finally--after an hour and a half of turned down offers, Taehyung strikes gold.
---
The bedroom is incredibly clean. Namjoon thinks he might ruin it if he’s not careful.
Taehyung moves inside with reckless abandon while Namjoon lingers at the doorway. When he does finally step in, he does do gingerly, eyes on the floor as though he could dislodge a speck of dirt and have it be noticed by the pair who sleep here.
“Hoseok-hyung’s a bit of a neatfreak. It helps when it comes to cleaning, but it’s one of the things Yoongi-hyung dislikes the most about him. It means the room has to stay perfect or else.” Taehyung stops talking when he reaches his destination. He doesn’t explain the ‘or else.’
Namjoon wonders what could be so bad coming from Hoseok of all people.
---
A large bookshelf lines one wall of the room. Beside it, a window, curtains pulled open and bright mid-morning light spilling in, and a comfortable chair situated right in front.
“Hoseok-hyung likes to read in the morning, sometimes. When he has enough time, at least,” Taehyung gestures to the shelves and leans against the arm of the chair. He speaks again, quieter now. “He’s told us his dad was a literature teacher and read to him when he was little. So he feels closer to him when he reads,” there’s a small shrug. “He won’t mind you using some of his books. Just, you know. Don’t ruin them, I guess.”
Taehyung pushes off from the chair and starts past Namjoon. “I’ll be in the kitchen if you need me, Hyung. Don’t hesitate to come get me or call. I won’t mind the distraction.”
---
Namjoon doesn’t call or move to get Taehyung. He spends the first forty-five minutes running his hands over the spines of the books, fingers ghosting across the titles. There are so many of them. A lot he recognizes, but most he doesn’t. The covers of some he pulls look like he remembers the classics he had to read in his literature classes back in school.
For a moment, every time he looks more closely at one, he wonders if they were what he would have read had he managed to stay and graduate.
But Namjoon hadn’t been given that luxury.
---
He plows through thinner books. Plays and collections of short stories and tales that average out at, maybe, one hundred pages.
When he can’t decide what to read next, he carefully extracts books from the shelves and stacks them on the windowsill, pulling them to himself one by one and working through one hundred or so pages before moving to the next. He doesn’t have anything to mark the pages handy, and the corners aren’t already dog eared, so he wouldn’t dare do it now. Instead, he decides to try and remember where he left off.
---
Taehyung interrupts him once for lunch. He makes Namjoon move to the kitchen and, though Taehyung says it’s fine to bring one with him, Namjoon leaves all the books in the bedroom.
Lunch is a peanut butter, honey, and banana sandwich with a small bag of chips on the side. Taehyung serves up juice boxes and a dish towel hung over his arm, asking if Namjoon would like the red or the white.
Namjoon almost doesn’t get the joke.
---
He worked as a dishwasher at a fancy restaurant once. It takes a moment before he remembers that’s where he heard the sentence before, and then he can answer.
“The most expensive box you’ve got, Sir.”
“Good choice,” a toothy grin so bright Namjoon is sure he’s gone blind.
---
(Later, Taehyung will tell the rest of his housemates about the joke. He’ll try to describe the expression on Namjoon’s face when he responded: “He was conflicted, you know? He wasn’t sure if it was okay to joke--but it’s totally okay and I’m glad he did and it was funny. He smiled and it was nice and I really think he could do that more often--but anyway, yeah. He didn’t know if he should say something back and his brows kind of went together like this and his lips pursed just a bit and I think he might have chewed on the bottom one a little bit? I was too excited to get to use the joke on a fresh pair of ears. But, uh. Yeah. So. He said his thing and then I smiled and he smiled and it was kind of shy and nervous, but definitely a smile. It can be done!”)
---
He gets sent back to Hoseok and Yoongi’s room with a blank piece of paper. Namjoon sets about ripping it into small strips to use as bookmarks, sliding them between the pages of the novels he’s started.
It makes switching from one to another much easier.
---
When he gets home, Hoseok stands in the doorway of his bedroom, looking in at the unexpected guest in his chair.
Sleeping in his chair.
Namjoon has a book propped open on his lap and is snoring, head lolled back and mouth open.
Hoseok carefully extracts the book, finding the paper bookmark on top of the stack in front of the window, and marks the place. He’s careful and quiet when he settles the book on top of the stack, and even quieter when he pulls a blanket from his bed.
It gets laid over Namjoon’s sleeping form and Hoseok makes sure it won’t fall off before he leaves with a small stack of clothes and a towel, heading for a shower.
---
Namjoon is confused when he wakes up to a loud bang and a hissed shout. He startles with a grunt and a sharp intake of breath. The blanket makes a break for it, but he snatches it, thinking it’s the book he was reading.
He’s even more confused when it’s not.
“I didn’t wake you, did I?” Namjoon jerks to the side, eyes wide, staring over his shoulder in the direction of the voice.
Hoseok is laying on the bed, upside down with his head hanging over the edge. There’s a noticeable red blotch on his forehead and a book clutched tightly, almost too tightly, in his grip, held aloft by steady hands. “I might have just dropped the book on my face because this position is shit to read in, but my elbows were hurting from leaning on them and my ass was hurting from sitting on it,” a pause. He shrugs awkwardly in the position. “The struggles of readers, man. Let me tell you,” Hoseok laughs, rolling onto his stomach, but allowing his arms to dangle over the edge in place of his head. The book almost touches the floor.
“I...no--no,” Namjoon coughs into a fist, turning his head. His voice is cracky and croaky from his nap and his open mouthed snoring and it takes a few tries before he can speak normally at all. “No, you didn’t. I don’t think. I--sorry. Sorry for being in here; Taehyung said it was okay and told me I could read your books and I’m sorry if--.”
“He told you it was okay because it is, Namjoon. They’re mine, yeah, but anyone can read them, so long as they put them back,” he shifts, closing his book, but keeping a finger in to hold his place. In a few smooth motions, Hoseok’s on his feet and striding over, stealing a strip of paper to mark his own place.
Hoseok contemplates the small stack in front of the window, eyes scanning the titles. “You’ve been reading a lot though--you like books?”
Namjoon swallows and tries to hide his hands inside the sweater more than they are. “I...the library is warm in the winter,” he glances off, shrugging lightly. It’s embarrassing to admit, especially when he knows Hoseok will understand the actual meaning.
“That it is, man,” Hoseok leans against the wall near the window. “I don’t care if you want to borrow some, Namjoon. You can even take them out of the room,” a laugh. “As long as you bring them back when you’re done. I’ll help you move this whole stack to the living room if you want,” a pause. “Or you can read in my chair; it’s comfy, isn’t it? I knew getting such a nice reading chair would be a good investment.” Hoseok grins.
Namjoon wets his lips, glancing up. “Which is easiest for you?” careful. He doesn’t want to have Hoseok resend the offer.
“Nope,” Hoseok keeps grinning. “Your decision. I don’t care one way or the other. But Yoongi isn’t a fan of light when he’s trying to sleep, so you’ll only be able to read during the day when he’s out at work and not at night if you stay in here. Otherwise, you’re welcome anytime.” A shrug.
Namjoon nods, but doesn’t answer just yet.
“Everyone is home by now, I think. Dinner’s almost done, too. A general rule is when you smell it, it’s damn near finished,” a pause. “Come on, let’s eat.”
---
Namjoon joins Hoseok again when they’re done eating and cleaning the kitchen. He dried dishes again and Yoongi settled for just putting them away in their proper places.
Seokjin watched from the doorway in the living room, gauging interactions. He was gone before they finished, sitting in the living room with a laptop open, working on setting up an online game for himself.
---
Namjoon and Hoseok chat about the books they’re reading while they work through them. Hoseok’s read everything he owns and remembers most of what they say, so he’s good conversation no matter what book Namjoon talks about. Sometimes, it takes a few tries to get Hoseok to remember, but he usually pulls through in the end.
As night starts to settle, Yoongi arrives, slowly starting to get ready for bed. He doesn’t seem bothered by Namjoon’s presence and offers a sleepy smile on his way to the bathroom with his pajamas. Changing in front of Hoseok and the other’s is one thing, but he doesn’t know Namjoon and Namjoon doesn’t know him. The last thing he wants is to make the man uncomfortable.
When Yoongi returns to the room, Namjoon slides three books under his arms and bids them both a goodnight.
---
He stays up most of the night, reading.
Jimin turns the living room light off when he gets up in the morning to get coffee going for everyone. When he pot is working, he fixes Namjoon’s blankets and the stack of books, double checking that there are bookmarks in each one before moving on with his morning routine.
---
Namjoon spends the next day in Hoseok and Yoongi’s room again, reading. Hoseok had left the rest of the pile of books undisturbed on the windowsill and Namjoon is both relieved and embarrassed about it.
Even so, he reads and reads and reads. He stops only when Taehyung gets him for lunch--canned soup heated up in the microwave--and then he’s back in the chair, devouring more words than he has food in the past four days.
---
Yoongi’s the one who finds him this time. He doesn’t put a blanket over the man but, instead, removes the book and jostles Namjoon lightly. “Come on, Kid. Let’s get you in a bed.”
There’s sleepy grumbles, but Namjoon follows along, heaving himself out of the comfortable chair with more effort than the action should need. He stumbles along behind Yoongi and falls unceremoniously onto Hoseok’s bed, drawing his legs up tight to his torso, curling as much into a ball as he can.
Yoongi tugs and tucks the blankets, getting them situated over Namjoon, and then he leaves, settling onto the couch to nap.
He’d never get to sleep with that godawful snoring.
---
Yoongi is the one to get him for dinner as well, gently touching shoulders and giving careful shakes to his arms.
The food is hot and steaming and Seokjin still makes Namjoon’s plate, but there seems to be more on it today. He doesn’t complain and eats it all, more than happy with how it tastes.
He dries dishes and passes them off to Yoongi and, when it’s over, he makes an attempt to escape back to Hoseok’s room to read more, but Seokjin stops him.
---
“Taehyung went through his closet and drawers and picked out a bunch of clothes he doesn’t wear anymore, Namjoon,” a pause. “I did as well. We’re the tallest, so we think it should be okay for you.” Seokjin shifts his weight from one foot to the other, head tipping back slightly, appraising the other man.
“You can change into anything you want after a shower--and I think you might need one tonight, don’t you?” He’s not trying to be rude and Namjoon knows that. He’s just being truthful and, really, Namjoon should have gotten back into the habit of bathing every day when he got here, but it was hard.
He was taking so much from these men. He didn’t want to take water and electricity anymore than he already was.
“Right--sorry. I didn’t mean to make anyone uncomfortable or--.”
“You’re not. I’m just telling you so you know it’s okay. You don’t need permission, but I think you want it, so I’m giving it to you now..”
And with that, Seokjin is gone, moving away and to the couch to pull his laptop over for more games.
---
The shower is scalding and Namjoon comes out pink. Taehyung spends five minutes in the hallway poking at Namjoon’s arms, watching his fingerprints appear on the cleaned skin. He compliments Namjoon on his bear pajamas.
Namjoon, red in the cheeks, reminds him that they belong to the younger.
“No they don’t?” Taehyung replies, brows furrowing up.
“Seokjin-hyung, then.”
“Nope.”
Namjoon frowns. “Then who--.”
“They’re yours, Silly.” He laughs as he presses more fingerprints into Namjoon’s arms before starting down the hall, humming a slow tune while he disappears into his room.
---
The thought that they’re his doesn’t settle well with Namjoon.
He reads from the most depressing book he’s working on, bogged down with The Road while curled up in Hoseok’s comfortable window chair.
---
All the clothes Seokjin and Taehyung gave up had been laundered and folded, left sitting in a pair of baskets behind the couch. They didn’t take up much space, but Namjoon still felt bad about it. They belonged to the other men, not Namjoon. He had no place keeping them.
But it was nice to be able to pick what he wanted to wear. It was nice pulling on a pair of jeans that reached his ankles, even if they were loose around his hips and legs. It was nice having tops that had no holes and sleeves that could reach his hands.
---
Namjoon sorts through them all at night, when everyone is asleep. He unfolds every piece and tries it on, marveling at the softness in the fabric. Sure, they’re essentially hand-me-downs, but they still retained some of their gentle new feeling.
Everything fits, albeit loosely, and there’s so much variety, Namjoon is almost overwhelmed.
---
The next morning, the baskets are a little emptier and Seokjin searches for where the clothing disappeared to.
He finds it all tucked into the duffel Namjoon had with him when he’d come to the house. It was unzipped and on the floor by his head, one limp arm extended toward it. Namjoon had fallen asleep trying to pack the bag. The blankets aren’t even on his body, still crumpled at his feet where they were kicked the morning before.
Seokjin frowns lightly and works to carefully remove the clothing from the bag, returning it to the baskets. The bag was settled back down and Seokjin gently tucks the outstretched arm to reunite it with it’s match under the blanket he pulls up.
---
The development worries Seokjin all day. Was Namjoon planning on running out on them? Or was he just deciding that what he wanted was to leave?
Worse yet: Was he afraid they’d kick him out?
Seokjin doesn’t know, but he really hopes it’s none of the options.
---
When Namjoon wakes up, he finds Jimin standing over him. There’s a blue mug clutched carefully in his hands and he offers a hesitant, sleepy smile down. “Hyung hasn’t asked if you drink coffee, but I made you a cup. It’s black, but we’ve got lots of stuff in the kitchen for it.”
Namjoon sits up, wetting dry lips. He doesn’t remember falling asleep last night, but that’s alright. He woke up here, in the house. Warm and safe.
So it’s okay.
Everything is alright.
---
“Don’t you have, uh. Classes today, or something?” Namjoon’s not even sure how he takes coffee. He’s always had it black when he gets it. People tend to buy you coffee if it’s easy to remember, and it’s faster to order and get out of coffee shops where you’re unwanted if you get a simple order.
Sure, he’s tried things from the cafes he’s worked at, but he never knew if he liked them.
But today--today he’s poured in some flavored creamer and a bit of sugar and stirred it up, taking a long sip. It tastes good, albeit a little too sweet, but he doesn’t mess with it again.
Jimin just laughs, though, smiling even as he takes another drink from his own mug.
(The blue had been his own drink. Namjoon’s had been sitting on the counter in a pale pink mug. Not that he cared. He just hadn’t expected pink in a house with six men.)
(Then again, there’s a lot of things he hadn’t expected in a house with six men.)
“I don’t have classes or work on Fridays. I also don’t have work on Mondays, but I go back to my job tomorrow.”
Namjoon nodded, looking down into his mug. “So it’s your job today to watch me.”
A shrug. “If that’s how you want to think of it, go ahead. I don’t expect anything from you, Namjoon-hyung. I’m here if you have questions, but I plan to do my own thing.”
---
Staying with Jimin was much more uncomfortable than staying with Seokjin or Taehyung. For one, he knew much less about Jimin than he did the other two men. Second, Jimin really was quiet. Seokjin had warned him it would take some time for him to warm up to him, and that truthfully seemed to be the case.
Jimin wasn’t rude, of course. He just didn’t talk much to Namjoon. He studied for a class and made sure Namjoon ate. Namjoon heard him mumbling to himself as he went through the textbook and his notes, flipping pages back and forth and writing in small margins to remind himself of important things.
Namjoon didn’t mind, and sat at the kitchen table with the younger reading a borrowed book.
---
He realizes later that, honestly, it was a pretty comfortable day, just sitting quietly with someone who didn’t expect anything from you other than survival.
---
The day Namjoon had with Jungkook--that had been a riot. The younger had somehow convinced Namjoon out to the backyard and into the snow. It was chilly and cold and he had on one of Taehyung’s old winter coats and mismatched gloves, hat, and scarf.
They made a terrible and incredibly small snowman, followed by many more, forming a tiny army in the backyard.
They made snow angles and, after an internal debate, Namjoon shoved a snowball into Jungkook’s face.
As it turned out, arm wrestling wasn’t the only thing Jungkook was good at.
---
Namjoon was massacred and buried in the snow.
---
(Arm wrestling was something else Namjoon tried, after they’d both warmed up from Namjoon’s failed snowball fight and finished their hot cocoa.
He lost.
Pitifully.
Six times.)
---
Namjoon’s time there continued much the same over the following days. Whoever didn’t work or have class would keep an eye on him. They made sure he ate and drank and showered. Stole his dirty clothes to toss in with their laundry. When he fell asleep reading, which was often, they’d put a marker in the book and put it up safely, making sure there was a blanket tossed over to keep him warm.
Seokjin didn’t question Namjoon again about staying. He didn’t question the duffel bag full of clothes he’d found.
But he did notice Namjoon didn’t pack it again.
---
(Truthfully, Namjoon thought he had dreamed the event. He could have swore he had packed the bag, but it hadn’t been where he thought it would be when he woke up, so he must have just thought he did.
No big deal.)
---
The end of the second week, Namjoon clearly looked better. There was still work to be done, but he had a healthy flush to his cheeks. His meals stopped being measured. They stopped worrying so much about him. They stopped keeping such a close eye on him.
Namjoon felt accepted here. He felt right.
Maybe not perfect--no, he wasn’t sure if he could fit here. He wasn’t positive he would. He’d always be a piece to the wrong puzzle.
But at least he was a piece.
---
At the end of that second week, Seokjin asked to talk to him, and the pair disappeared into the elder’s bedroom.
---
“What do you want, Namjoon?”
The younger tensed, staring at Seokjin with a blank expression at first, then looking away. He couldn’t meet the other’s eyes.
“Namjoon,” a shift. “Joonie,” much softer that time, “Please. You have to understand that we have a routine here. We have a certain way we survive together. I’m not telling you to leave, but I am saying that--.”
“I’ve reached the end of my welcome,” Namjoon mumbled, interrupting without really thinking of it.
“No, Namjoon. No. Don’t think like that. Don’t think that. Don’t ever think you’ve stayed too long. It’s just that--.”
“I’ve stayed too long without paying you back.” Still quiet. He doesn’t look up.
Seokjin licks his lips, shifting forward and reaching to softly rest a hand on Namjoon’s shoulder. The younger almost pulls away. Seokjin can feel his muscles tense up under his touch and he thinks, maybe, he should let go. But he doesn’t. “So what do you want, Namjoon? I’ll still buy you that bus fare, if you’d like that.” A pause. He squeezes. “Or--.”
---
Namjoon doesn’t give him a chance to finish the sentence.
“I--I can’t leave,” head turning up. “This--this is--it’s as close to a family as I’ve had since I was sixteen,” not even scared to admit it, now. If it gives him a better chance of being allowed to stay, he’ll say whatever he needs to.
“They--they kicked me out,” a small choked breath. The air in the room feels unnaturally heavy and Namjoon finds he’s having a hard time pulling it in properly.
That or his lungs have disappeared.
He’s not sure which is more likely.
“I’m gay and I told them and they kicked me out. They abandoned me and I didn’t know what to do and I haven’t known what to do since then. But I feel good here. I feel--I mean, I feel okay at least, and that’s--that’s good, right? I don’t want to lose that. I’ll do whatever I have to to keep it.”
Namjoon reaches up, grabbing and holding onto the hand Seokjin had on his shoulder. “I know--I know it’s not...it’s not the same as what any of you went through, but--but, please. Please.”
---
His eyes feel wet. He’s not sure if he’s crying or not, but his eyes just feel wet and his vision’s a little blurred.
---
He is crying. Seokjin moves the hand from Namjoon’s grip to touch the man’s cheek, cupping and rubbing with his thumb at salt trails as they trickle down.
Seokjin starts making shushing noises under his breath. He doesn’t realize he’s doing it, he just does.
---
“Please, don’t make me leave. You’re all so nice and I don’t deserve it, but I want it. And it’s selfish and it’s rude, but I want it. I just--I want--I’ve never wanted anything so much,” His shoulders are shaking and Seokjin draws the younger in. Namjoon may be taller, but he hunches to press his face into Seokjin’s neck, trying to pull air in while his body racks itself with sobs.
The shushing continues, now accompanied with gentle rocking and hands rubbing along Namjoon’s back. Seokjin feels his shirt bunch up and knows Namjoon’s grabbed it to ball in his fists, holding nice and tight.
---
There’s the quietest of knocks on the door.
---
They hadn’t been listening outside. They really hadn’t. But Namjoon had started to, almost, wail, and they were there now. Jimin knocking and opening the door to creep in, arms sliding carefully around Namjoon from behind and snaking between both men until he was gripping Namjoon’s stomach. His head pressing softly against the middle of the older’s shoulder blades. Taehyung was next, hugging the pair awkwardly from the side. Hoseok. Yoongi.
Jungkook came in last, carrying a pair of juice boxes and tucking himself in against the hug.
---
None of them really knew how long they stood there. The previously refrigerator cold juice boxes were still a little chilled, but not as much as they had been. It was the only way to judge the time, they found.
Jungkook stabbed the straws in and offered one to Namjoon.
His eyes were red rimmed and puffy. His nose was leaking grossly and they all realized quickly he wasn’t exactly a pretty cryer.
They also realized they didn’t much care. Family sometimes comes with snot and tears. You just deal with it as it rolls in.
Namjoon rubbed at his nose to rid it of the snot there, and then he took the offered box, giving the youngest a shaky smile.
---
“So,” it's Taehyung who breaks the silence, but he also startles at the volume of his own voice, working his arms, now stiff from being squished in the hug. “How is the rooming situation going to go? Someone's gonna have to get a new bed in their room, right? He can't just sleep on the couch, right? We're not gonna make him sleep on the couch permanently, right? Because that would just hurt his back--not that he’s slept on the couch for long. He had the floor for a while there and, I mean, well. You know...right?”
The questions come rapid fire and full of worry. Taehyung scans everyone's faces, trying to find some answer.
Seokjin snorts and shakes his head, offering a smile toward the younger. “Jungkook and I have the largest room, so it only makes sense to rearrange and work on fitting Namjoon in here. But that's something we'll work on in the next couple of days. First things first: finding Namjoon a job.”
---
The options start to roll out before they make it to the living room. Before they ask what he knows how to do. Before they ask what he likes.
“The florist near the record store is hiring, I think. I could ask the manager when I go to work tomorrow?”
“I've got a friend at the coffee shop across the street from campus. They'll hire if I ask. Could always use more people who aren't students.”
“The studio has been looking for a cleaner? It's midnight hours, but pays well, I think.”
“The bus goes past a library. I think I saw a sign in the--.”
---
Seokjin coughs into a fist and raises a brow at the group. “Maybe we should listen to Namjoon before we bombard him with a million options?”
Namjoon looks grateful for the quiet that follows, until he realizes he's supposed to fill it. Then he just feels awkward. He rubs at his face, and then eyes, just for something to do in the quiet.
“I, uh. I have no preference, honestly. I've done pretty much everything at some point. But I’m…,” he finally speaks and glances down, fingers fiddling with the hem of his shirt.
It's pale pink and he assumes it belonged to Seokjin at some point, but he hasn't asked.
“I’m not good at much. I'm pretty clumsy and just--I’m bad at everything, more or less. If I'm being honest. I’ve been fired from every job I’ve ever had.” He shrugs, and doesn't look up. He doesn't want to see their faces.
He doesn’t want to see the look they’re probably giving him; disappointment. They’re bound to be disappointed they picked such a screw up for their new housemate.
---
“You're not bad at everything,” Hoseok starts off, stepping forward. “You've read your way through nearly half my bookshelves. It's been two weeks. I think going to the library like Tae suggested would be the best bet. Or a bookstore--does anyone know one close by?” there are a few nods.
“Everyone is good at something Namjoon--and don't think I didn't notice you read the collector's edition of Hamlet I have. The one in English. And I mean like reading-reading it. Not just looking at it like I do sometimes. That's such a good skill to have-- how do you even know English? Did you go to really good schools or something?”
Namjoon shifts his weight, uncomfortable with the thought of explaining. After a moment though, he shrugs. “I taught myself. At the library. I never…,” a pause. He swallows. “I never finished school. I was…I got kicked out of my house when I was sixteen. The beginning of my second to last year.”
He says it quietly, as though no one would hear it at all if he spoke just above a whisper.
“Well,” Yoongi begins, wetting his lips and glancing around the room. “I guess the real first order of business is figuring out how to go about getting you a GED. It'll be helpful to have, I’m sure.” There are a few agreeable nods and Namjoon turns his head up enough to be able to look at Yoongi.
And Namjoon smiles. It’s small and tight lipped.
But it’s a smile.
It’s a start.
---
They’ll take it.
---
It takes work--of course it takes work. The six of them pitch in to buy a bed to fit into the biggest bedroom. It doesn’t create that much of a space issue, not when Hoseok gets his hands on the room.
Seokjin swears it looks better now than when they first moved in. The younger did a great job on optimizing the space, making sure all three of the men living in here would have enough room for their clothes and personal belongings.
It wasn’t hard on Namjoon’s end. He doesn’t have any.
---
Yet.
---
The six of them decide to rectify that, and after a little bit of prodding, they manage to find some things the newcomer will like.
His dresser is decorated with the useless knick-knacks, but he makes sure they stay dusted and in their proper formation, even if it doesn’t really matter in the big picture. It matter to him. They’re now his most prized possessions. He wants them to stay nice.
They get Namjoon a small bookshelf and six books--their favorites. The genre’s range--there’s a horror novel and a book of poetry and, surprising him most, a children’s book that’s handed over from Seokjin.
---
(“One of the first families I remember staying with gave me a copy to take with me when I went from foster home to foster home. I managed keep a hold of it until I was fifteen, then it got lost somewhere.”)
---
Namjoon starts work at a bookstore a block and a half down the road from the house. He walks with Jimin to the bus stop in the mornings, but doesn’t board like the younger does. Instead, he continues on to the shop and to his job.
It’s nice. It’s relaxing.
The man who owns it appreciates the fact that Namjoon loves books so much. He also likes that Namjoon can now cater to his foreign customers.
(The shop gets good reviews online after Namjoon starts working there. Not that it had bad ones before, it’s just that, now, those who speak English can get help finding the right books to learn Korean without struggling to speak to the Korean shopkeeper.)
---
Most of all, Namjoon puts on weight. The hand-me-down clothes start to fit properly.
They take him clothing shopping with his first couple of paychecks. Before he starts paying for his seventh of the bills, they want to get him settled properly.
The clothing store is an adventure in and of itself and they all have a pretty good time, laughing and joking around and Namjoon smiles the entire day, from the moment he wakes up to when he closes his eyes to sleep.
His face hurts the following day, but he revels in it and smiles a little more.
---
Sometimes, it’s hard. He still doesn’t seem like he fits perfectly. Like he’s ruined the masterpiece that is this household.

But then he’ll steal Taehyung’s juice boxes with Jungkook and sit outside in the grass to watch the bugs or find shapes in the clouds or watch the way the light filters through the maple tree.

But then he’ll ask questions about animals or nature and Taehyung will prattle on for hours, losing his train of thought and they’ll wind up talking about why houndstooth is such an overused pattern on clothes, in Taehyung’s opinion.

But then he’ll awkwardly lose at video games he’s never played with Jimin, who will teach him all the cheats and button combinations.

Then he’ll settle next to Hoseok in comfortable silence and read and read and read.

Then he’ll sit next to Yoongi, sides pressed together and sharing headphones so the elder can introduce him to all the music Namjoon’s missed out on for all these years.

Then he’ll rest at the kitchen table and listen to the sounds of Seokjin cooking them all dinner, the silence comfortable enough that he’ll, sometimes, fall asleep, head pillowed in his arms.
---
And everything is perfect. And Namjoon finds that he’s finally happy.
All this time, and he’s happy.
And that’s what he loves the most.



Chapter End Notes
I have a lot more information regarding this final chapters AU than will fit in the notes (or that anyone would want to read, ohmygod.) If you have any questions at all--any habits /characteristics/quirky recurrences explained, I might have an answer or be able to come up with one/explain why something is the way it is. Feel free to ask in the comments and I’ll do my best to answer promptly!But here are a few that’ll help explain some of the more important stuff.Seokjin is frazzled when Namjoon meets him because he decided he didn’t need to look up directions to the bakery because he’d “just get there when he gets there, don’t worry. I’ll return with the cake, I promise!” This is from his tendency to just assume he’ll get where he’s going on trips (like we saw in Bon Voyage when he and Jimin were trying to find their hotel)!PSA: Be nice to bees. I spent 3 years hard researching them and their population decline while getting my degree. They just want to help. They really do think you’re a flower (and you are. You’re all flowers. Congrats.)Octopuses, Octopi, and Ocotopodes are all accurate and grammatically correct ways to refer to more than one octopus. It has to do with how dumb the people who standardized English are.Jimin has an exam on the bones of the foot. Taehyung isn’t being helpful and almost gets a face full of milk.Taehyung enjoys the taste of juice boxes. There’s just something about that weird cardboard and plastic addition to the flavor of juice.Jungkook just likes making him mad.Apparently, sandalwood and tangerine are a good mix of smells for anti-anxiety?I have personal experience dropping books on my face.The Road by Cormac McCarthy is a dystonia novel about a dad and son traveling and there’s cannibalism and it’s been a while but I think someone eats a baby???I don’t know man, at one point I owned 912 books and I thought I was way out of line, so I donated a bunch and now it’s down to a respectable about 300-ish. But let me tell you, when trying to find titles to use for this I blanked and all that came to my mind was goddamn Fox in Socks.Again, thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed it! And thank you for any and all lovely comments I’ve received and may receive in the future!


Bangtan Epilogue
Chapter Notes
Welp. This is it.Phosphenes is done, officially! Thank you for being here with me and I hope you enjoyed reading this mess!
Also, I may have cried writing this part? It was really bittersweet. I enjoyed writing the whole story, so it was nice to get to wrap it up like this.
PS: Okay, so I lied and there might have been a bit of love in the previous chapter. But it was one sided and he literally never confesses ever so it doesn't count. They're still best friends.

Of course things have to change. Time passes and they can’t do much to stop it.
Everything stays as it is for three and a half more years. Everyone is happy and everyone is healthy. 
But then Jungkook does very well at expediting and waiting tables. He moves into a small studio apartment when he’s got enough money to do so safely. He knows how to manage money and he knows how to save. He marries the only child of the owner of the restaurant. As it turns out, the family is well off and Jungkook could stop working if he wants.Instead, they open up a new restaurant on the other side of town. He and his spouse run it together and it’s often the place the seven of them meet when they’re all in the same place at the same time.
But then Taehyung gets promoted. He’s the lead environmental educator, now. Part of the job is to travel the country and help other zoos, animal parks, and aquariums spruce up their own programs. The zoo in Seoul puts him up in an apartment close enough he can walk to his office without much effort.He’s rarely ever in the apartment though. He travels all the time. It’s fun, and for the first year, he stops in at the house as often as possible. Any free chance he gets, he comes to visit. Seokjin keeps juice boxes in the fridge just for those moments. Taehyung says his room feels a little emptier without Jimin there, so he sleeps on the floor of Yoongi and Hoseok’s.After that first year, though, Taehyung gets busy. But with a full time job traveling and a new close friend who eventually becomes a girlfriend becomes a wife becomes the mother of his children? It’s hard to find time other than the major holidays.He calls, though. And texts.All the time he calls and texts and reminisces and sends them all too many photos of his twins and badly framed images of animals he works with.
But then Jimin gets an amazing offer to work at a hospital in Gwangju where he’d be the Head Nurse and lead the entire staff. Hoseok tells him everything he can about his old home town. All seven go to the train station to say goodbye. Jungkook gives him a warm juice box and tells him not to drink it all in one sitting.They can see through the window that Jimin’s cheeks are wet as the train pulls away and he waves frantically, leaning his head to the glass long after he can’t see them anymore.They all say nothing about it. Their cheeks are streaked with salt just as much.Jimin falls for a foreign girl studying abroad at the time. He’s always hated the idea of long distance relationships, but Europe isn’t that far.Right? And he's never been one for learning languages, but for her; he'd take on the world.
But then Yoongi breaks into radio broadcasting. He’s hired, first, to be a midnight host back in Daegu. Once he’s settled in, he gets a better spot--co-hosting with a friendly woman, switching with another pair every other week to do morning and afternoon rush hour shows.Hoseok quits his job at the dance studio in Seoul to go with Yoongi to Daegu. They’ve been through so much together, he’s not stopping now. They rent a small one bedroom apartment together and Hoseok starts from the bottom at a dance academy, teaching beginner ballet to toddlers and children under seven. He doesn’t mind. They’re cute and lovable and he still comes home sticky, but he’s used to that. It’s not so bad, really. He enjoys kids and they enjoy him.They call him ‘Uncle Hobi-Hobi’ and he thinks it’s the best. Yoongi says they’re a bunch of disrespectful brats. Hoseok punches his arm every time and complains that Yoongi just doesn’t know what cute is.Eventually, Yoongi starts dating his co-host and they're cute together. They're perfect. They love a lot of the same things and she takes none of Yoongi's shit.Hoseok’s happy for him. Really. Even if his heart isn’t. He finds someone he can love and that can love him back in the form of a single father that drops his daughter off for ballet lessons once a week.Of the seven, Hoseok marries first. It’s a small affair and the seven of them throw birdseed at Hoseok only, purposefully missing his husband. He’s laughing along with them until Jungkook accidentally throws an entire, closed bag a little too hard and Hoseok winds up with a black eye.The photos at the reception are ruined, but it’s a good memory they can laugh about.
But then, eventually, it’s just Seokjin and Namjoon packing up the last of the boxes in the house. With just the two of them alone, it’s cold and empty and too much upkeep. Namjoon doesn’t like the feeling and suggests they move a month after Jungkook leaves for his newly rented studio apartment. Seokjin can’t argue with the idea.He’d been thinking the same thing.
The place they rent is small, but it fits their needs. It’s near both of their jobs--Seokjin, now head baker. The owner retired from actually making food and simply runs the business on paper. Seokjin is the one really in charge. Namjoon still jumped around a few times. It was hard to find a good fit until he wound up at a small library in Seoul where the woman still sneak him snacks from time to time.They were all glad he looked healthy.(They were all glad he looked happy.)
And he did. He’d put on weight and filled out. His clothes-- his clothes--fit him well. He’d gotten his GED and thought, sometimes, about maybe attending some college courses, but just never got to it.When he wasn’t reading in his spare time, he took to writing. What it was, he didn’t know, but Seokjin got his hands on Namjoon’s laptop one night and couldn’t put it down. He tried numerous times to exit out of the document, but he simply couldn’t. It was riveting.
Namjoon sees his sister a few months before he finds a publisher willing to take on the monster that is his novel. It’s semi-autobiographical. No one has to know it’s actually his story. Everyone will believe it’s the main character’s fake life--until they read the author’s page.
But Namjoon sees his sister.She looks good and Namjoon isn’t angry.She hadn’t been the problem.
He finds out over bitter coffee and stale muffins from a cheap coffee shop they find nearby in a rush to just sit, that their father died of a stress induced heart attack three years after Namjoon left. Their mother started looking for Namjoon after that, but could never find him.
“She wanted to apologize, Oppa,” his sister can’t meet his eyes. “Because she realized they were wrong. For what they did. She knows you don’t have to forgive her, but just...know she’s sorry.”
“I don’t forgive her,” Namjoon answer quickly and is blunt about it. Over the years with his friends (with his family), he’s come to terms with what happened. He’s moved past it, more or less. He doesn’t allow it to dictate what he does with his life. “I won’t forgive her for what she and our father did. And I can’t begin to understand how they could think it was such a great idea to kick their sixteen year old son out onto the streets with nothing more than a few pieces of clothes and their pocket change,” a pause. “But it is what it is.”
His sister doesn’t try to defend their parents. She was only thirteen at the time. She had no say in what happened to him. “Do you want to see her? She wants to see you. Mom, I mean. She's never stopped looking, even after all this time.”
Namjoon thinks about it.For a moment, he really does.
“No.”“Okay. I’ll tell her you look happy.”“Tell her I am happy. Even after what they did to me, I am happy. And she can’t take that away from me.”
Seokjin tries to make him feel better that night with cookies and ice cream and root beer floats. It kind of works, but he only truly smiles when they have a joint video call, and the seven of them (plus a few passing husbands and wives and roaming toddlers that interrupt with sticky fingers and ‘Appa, Appa, look at this booger that came out of my nose?!’) can talk for an hour or so. They can’t do this often, but when schedules permit, it happens. Usually, it’s only a few of them at a time.(Jimin may have called off work to be here, but Seokjin said it was an emergency in the text he sent them all. They’d all do the same for him, so he didn’t think twice.)
Almost a year later and Namjoon has a book on the world’s best seller’s list. His mother could easily contact him now, but she doesn’t. He respects that. He and his sister exchanged numbers and have kept in touch. It’s cathartic, really. He doesn’t mind. She’s nice and his nephews are smart. They’ll grow up well, he’s sure.
Namjoon could move out of the apartment, but he doesn’t. Not at first. He waits until the seventh time Seokjin awkwardly has to stop kissing his girlfriend on the couch when Namjoon comes back into the apartment after a fan event or a book reading.
He finds himself a place to call his own in Ilsan. It’s not his old street, but it’s close. He goes to visit his old house and finds a new family there. His sister had told them she and her mother had moved out after their father passed away, so it’s not a surprise.It’s just strange. A little surreal.
He sits on a bench across the street and watches the children play in the front yard until the father crosses to ask him what he thinks he’s doing.“Sorry, Sir. I just--I used to live here. That’s all. I didn’t mean to make you nervous. I should be getting home anyway.”The man nods and watches him wearily, even as he’s walking away. Namjoon hears him yelling at one of the children to slow down or he’ll flip his trike over.There’s a crash, then lots of crying, and Namjoon can only assume the child hadn’t listened. He doesn’t turn around to look and just keeps walking.
 
Namjoon marries when he’s in his mid thirties. They have no children, but there’s a dog that is so spoiled rotten, it refuses to eat kibble.
Taehyung says the expression the dog wears all the time makes him think the thing must shit gold.
Hoseok politely asks Taehyung to stop swearing, or his daughter (who is in the room with him and patiently working on homework) will pick up the language and his husband will not appreciate that at all.
Jimin reminds Hoseok that she already swears because Hoseok does it too much as it is.
Yoongi refuses to come to Hoseok’s rescue. He did this to himself.
Jungkook laughs until milk comes out his nose. It’s unattractive, but he doesn’t care. They’ve all seen him look worse.
Seokjin makes sure Jungkook is okay. He reminds him what kind of chemicals can get stains out of nice clothing.
Namjoon quiets after that, just watching and listening to them banter. He’s reminded of good luck juice boxes and snow laden slippers. Of octopi (and octopodes and octopuses) with collective fond sighs. Of blankets and beds after falling asleep reading in a comfortable chair by a window while everyone was away.
He’s reminded of a lot of things in this moment.
But mostly, he’s reminded that he got to chose his family in the end. One that wouldn’t abandon him, no matter how far they’ve spread.
He’s reminded of all the love he’s felt from this rag tag group.
And he falls asleep on the call and the only reason they know is because he starts snoring.
(And none of them would admit it, but they sometimes miss that sound. So they sit there quietly and just listen until they’re all drawn away by their lives, but not without well wishes and good nights.)



Chapter End Notes
The order they move out might be a bit confusing. I tried to do as much in age order as I could for some reason, so I spoke of them moving out in that order, but it’s not how they left. Jimin went first, followed by Taehyung, then Yoongi and Hoseok, and finally Jungkook.
And I don’t care if you think Jungkook married a man or a woman; it’s ambiguous for a reason and I don’t even know why??? That’s just how it happened.
Also: Taehyung’s daughter wants you to look at her booger. It’s huge. Just look at it.



Afterword


End Notes
Phosphenes is the phenomenon where you see light without light actually going into your eyes. It's that thing where you close your eyes and rub them really hard and there's lots of colors.It always happens to me when I wake up after dreams.Which was the alternative title I had for this story.Like a Dream.
