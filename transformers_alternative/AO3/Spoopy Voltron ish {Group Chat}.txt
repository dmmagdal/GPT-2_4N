Chapter End Notes

Chapter Summary
Lotor messes with everyone basically. meme overload (glitch)(glitch)Basically my prediction for season five's plot
Chapter Notes
Hey, I warned you guys this was going to take forever to update XDDBUT THANK GOODNESS I FINALLY PULLED MY SHIT TOGETHER AND FINISHED THIS. Huzzah. Hope you enjoyed! Please don't expect too much other "quality" content like this any time soon. This nearly killed me.This was supposed to be the last chapter but I figured i'd be more motivated if i just went ahead and got this ish posted even tho there's some more ish to cover. As season five comes around, I actually may add more chapters. And I have tons of memes I couldn't use (because context sighs) so maybe that'll have its own chapter? idk, bear with me.

        See the end of the chapter for more notes

Help me think of a plan!Keith: IT DOESN'T MATTER HE'S GOING TO BACK STAB US!Allura: KEITH.Keith: PRINCESS.Allura: KEITH!Keith: damn i almost died and this is the respect i getMatt: i'm glad ur alive broKeith: b r o rlly?Matt: yeaHunk: oKAY bUt wHaT dID pRiNcE loSER mEAn whEn hE sAId hE kNew alFOR oR sOmE sHIT??Keith: IT DOESNT MATTER LOTOR IS A LIAR AND THAT'S WHY WE SHOULDShiro: STOP.Shiro: everyone just,,,, calm down,,,, before i have a heart attack from all this stress,,,Keith: fine but allura started itAllura: real mature, fuckfaceKeith: OH HO HO YOU WANNA GO BOO?Shiro: keith,, i will take away ur hot topic rights,,Keith: ha im not a paladin anymore suck on thatHunk: CAN YOU GUYS PLEASE STOP ARGUING SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HECKENS WE'RE GOING TO DO TO KEEP THE GALAXY SAFE AND ACT LIKE A HAPPY FAMILY IN OUR FRACKED UP LIVES. PLEASE. WE HAVE A MISSION SO STOP ACTING SO IMMATURE I AM SO SICK OF SOMETIMES BEING THE ONLY ONE CALMLY MAKING COOKIES IN THE BACKGROUND ACTING LIKE IT'S ALL CHILL WHEN IT'S  N O T SO PLS CALM DOWN SO EVERYTHING CAN BE CHILL BECAUSE WE'RE SO CLOSE TO BEING CAUGHT BY THE GALRA EMPIRELance: ...buddy.... you okay fam?Hunk: i,,, i'm a little messed upShiro: hunk is rightHunk: wow i am? 0: gasp am i finally getting appreciation??Shiro: sureLance: i appreciate youMatt: samePidge: dittoKeith: of courseShiro: Okay, to recap, we either help him and risk him turning on us or the Galra Empire finding us, or we can not help him at all. Allura makes a good point about living up to the message Voltron sends of hope and protection, not to mention he may have useful information... But, again, that is assuming he's not going to turn his back on us.Keith: pfft, that's a lot of "if'"s and "maybe"s don't you think?Lance: ditto. i kind of want to punch him nowAllura: Perhaps we can have a compromise...Lance: I'm listening...Allura: ...Pidge, Matt, is there a way we can add some technological protection to his ship so it's harder for the Empire to find him? A way in which we could possibly find him?Pidge: er, yes, but we may have to inspect his ship.. just to see if our tech can reach his easilyAllura: Alright. Pidge, Matt, and Hunk, I want you three to get on with that. Remain online so you can all confide with me and Shiro before you hook anything up. Matt: yes ma'am. Allura: Okay. The rest of you... If we assume we can grant Lotor at least some protection, where we can still track him... Do you suppose we talk to him about giving up some of his information regarding the Galra?Keith: ...Allura...Allura: I know you want to fight, Keith, but think about it: Voltron and Lotor, our whole coalition, fighting against the Galra Empire... I'm not saying it's something I want. I merely point out options. It's hard to tell exactly where Lotor's loyalties stand, but...Keith: the coalition is strong without Lotor! Even with his information we cannot trust him.Shiro: I think we should talk to him anyways, at least see if we can find common ground. Perhaps another compromise can be made...We can learn more about the Galra but not risk any more attacks. Lance: ...And if he wants to join the coalition, then we consider it. I agree it's too risky for him to be close in our ranks. If something were to happen to us...Keith: is it even safe to consider it at all? i believe in second chances, and yes, okay, he saved me, but that doesn't pay back for all the lives the Galra Empire have taken, all the planets they've dominated. Lotor doesn't act like his father, but he's already nearly destroyed us once. I wouldn't risk it again. I can't...Lance: ...Keith?Keith: ...I can't watch him tear the coalition apart.Shiro: Okay. So it's settled. Before we grant him minor protection with our own tech, we'll talk to him, see how much he knows, and plan based off what we know and what our priorities are. Sound fair?Allura: I concur. Lance: I second that.Keith: ...I suppose it'll work.Shiro: Great. Let's wait for Matt, Pidge and Hunk to reply. Keith...Keith: ...Yes, Shiro?Shiro: ...Stay safe fighting with the Blade of Marmora.Keith: Of course, Shiro.

Kolivan: why are you late son
Keith: don't call me son
Keith: i was...confiding with voltron, about the coalition. about lotor.
Kolivan: ah, yes... and why?
Keith: well they ARE on our side
Kolivan: you were talking with lotor, the enemy?
Keith: sighs look we were trying to find out information... He's out of power, he opposes his father... Allura thought maybe he could help us
Kolivan: mmhmm. That's be interesting, of he doesn't double-cross us, which I'm sure he will, the little bitch hffdjhjdskj he looks like a fuckin eggplant
Keith: that's what i said!! i totally agree
Kolivan: on what the first part or lotor being an eggplant?
Keith: both
Kolivan: and..
Kolivan: ..surely his presence could expose voltron to the empire?
Keith: their plan is risky. Allura will stop at nothing...
Kolivan: They can ruin our plans
Keith: they can be quite... Stubborn
Kolivan: yet you keep running back to them?
Keith: kolivan.... I'm loyal to the Blade
Kolivan: I don't think you know where your loyalties stand
Keith: I LEFT Voltron! I'm not a paladin. 
Kolivan: you act like one
Keith: how?
Kolivan: listen shorty u need to keep ur focus on your training. I can't risk you running back to dicktron and stirring up trouble and/or getting distracted. we already lost one member this week, we can't afford to lose another
Keith: ur not my dad
Kolivan: idc u lil bastard
Keith: now u sound like shiro
Kolivan: at least one of us does lol
Keith:
Keith: fuck u 
Kolivan: yeah whatevs mullet now go do some push-ups

Lotor opened a new group chat

Lotor: pssstt
Keith: !!!
Keith: Lotor!!??? What are you-
Lotor: sh come join me in this incognito group chat
Keith: I don't trust you dumbass!!!
Lotor: just do it!

Lotor invited Keith to Hi u like jazz

Keith: what's up with the title?
Lotor: I ran out of time ok
Keith: what the hell do u want I've had bout enough of u 
Lotor: was thinking of you 
Keith: ew gross
Keith: pls stop
Lotor: I was just wondering... And I'm thinking aloud here... 
Keith: hmm
Lotor: we could be an item
Keith: this was a mistake. Bye, bitch-
Lotor: no! Let me explain, Kogane
Keith: don't call me that you little fuck 
Lotor: we're one in the same! Alone in the universe, betrayed, galra.... 
Keith: thanks
Lotor: don't sass me, gerald
Keith: for the last time that's not my fucking middle name lance started that shit iT WAS A PHASE
Lotor: ahem
Lotor: imagine: Prince Lotor and Keith Kogane, working together, defeating the empire, doing bro things...
Keith: please rephrase that
Lotor: face it, we're both outcasts. we don't have any real family. we're shunned by the world. we've been betrayed! now it's our turn to show up the world. you're not making much of a different with the Blade, and you obviously don't belong with your other paladins. 
Keith: no... no, i refuse to be part of your ranks. you think we've been treated bad? look at what you've done to the empire!
Lotor: when did you start caring about the empire?
Keith: I don't! I just...
Lotor: See, your heart already knows I'm right. We belong together
Keith: yeah no
Keith: I don't care about the Galra Empire, the empire you tried to support
Lotor: in retrospect, i didn't believe in my father's ways
Keith: but I do care about my family
Lotor: What, Voltron? HA! You really think they're still your family? Keith, in case you haven't noticed, you LEFT them out of the blue for.. for what? THIS?
Keith: unlike some people I still help the galaxy!
Lotor: You solve nothing!! They didn't mean anything to you, and why would you mean anything to them? You said so yourself, you don't belong. You're not close to people. Do you really think they'll forgive you?
Keith: I...
Lotor: So what you have your training? So WHAT you have skills? You. Are. Still. Alone. There's nothing you can do without me, Keith. The Blade's useless, Voltron isn't your real home. I am your only option, unless you seriously think you can make a change all by yourself, against the rest of the galaxy? I can give you supplies, training, a home. We can end this world domination nonsense for once and for all. You just need to make a decision. Besides... I genuinely believe we have an understanding of each other. 
Keith: ...how the fuck are you so disgusting and cruel
Lotor: when i was ten i wanted a ballerina barbie with a pretty pink tutu
Keith:....wait what
Lotor: bUT YOU KNOW WHAT FATHER GOT ME?? MALIBU BARBIE
Keith: the audacity
Lotor: THAT WASN'T WHO I WAS. I WAS GRACEFUL, DELICATE.
Lotor: they had to go
Keith: ookay so you have issues
Lotor: wHY WON'T YOU LOVE ME??? I'LL TAKE YOU TO HOT TOPIC
Keith: BITCH WHERE
Lotor: IM GORGEOUS
Keith: BIIIITCH WHEEEREE???
Lotor: SCREAMS WHY DOES THE UNIVERSE HATE ME
Keith: get on somewhere before i dropkick yo ass back to your witch mom
Lotor: u wouldn't dare
Keith: try me eggplant

Chapter Summary
chaos before season five. you're welcomeinspiration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kXKQUu9SrA(Ifso Factso presents Voltron season 4)
Chapter Notes
Hopefully this is the last chapter XD I was trying to end this at three chapters buuut that didn't work out. I may update this with the information/events in season five (even though the plots are not going to add up that much) but I honestly have no idea. So let's just say FOR NOW this fic is over, though there's a 50/50 chance I may work on it some more. Thanks for the kudos! That means a lot to me. Whoever's even keeping up with this mess, bless you.I'm also working on this new work from my Platonic Voltron series. It's basically Princess Allura's POV of the main events throughout the series, all written as letters addressed to her Father as a coping mechanism. I think it's worth your time even though I'm still working out the plot. Here's the link:http://archiveofourown.org/works/13080057/chapters/29922558

But he did reveal a few things.Matt: ooh, now i'm interestedKeith: There might still be a connection between him and his generalsAllura: facepalm I knew I was forgetting something! Lotor's generals... That's not safe. I mean, they're also running from the Galra Empire, yet they are no longer a team...Pidge: Keith, what did you find out? Are they still loose?Keith: The dead one, Narti... she appearedHunk: wait, the one with the creepyass cat? She died...Keith: I don't know dude she appeared after Lotor started talking abot his traumatizing childhoodPidge: lmao whatKeith: something about a barbie dollHunk: what-Allura: No time. And Lotor just disappeared after this?Keith: Yes.Matt: he's not even on our communication lines, since he's leftPidge: Plus his generals haven't made an appearance. Who wants to be it was all planned?Allura: I hope not, we gave him our protection... Coran and I have already planned accordingly with the coalitionMatt: Don't worry princess, we can take the protection systems down, I'm sureLance: Even so it may be hard to track him... Okay, that's it. We need the Blade.Allura: Yes. We must give Kolivan our findings.Keith: I'll deliver the message.Lance: No, too riskyPidge: Lance's right. We need to come with you.. We told Lotor we'd remain put. He couldn't expect us, right? It works out both ways.Matt: Katie.. we also said we'd contact Kolivan for additional information.Hunk: And the generals are still out there...Pidge: We didn't give him a precise time though... So it's not a risk.Matt: Okay, okay.... tactically wise, what would work better?Lance: I could come with him.Keith: Lance?Lance: Two heads are better than one, right?Allura: Did you forget you're second in command? We need you here.Shiro: Guys. It's true Kolivan needs to be warned. And it might be risky to contact him through our systems...Pidge: HOW THE HELL DID WE FORGET WE COULD DO THATHunk: sighs it's been a long dayLance: ..you mean my heroic words were in vainMatt: yea so were mine dudeHunk: ..you've been singing the big time rush theme for the past hourMatt: ExactlyShiro: Incognito tab?Pidge: ..Maybe.

Chapter End Notes
i have no wordsin case you're not too terribly freaked out by me, here's my tumblr where you can scream at me and stuff: queennyxie.tumblr.comAlso about the last chapter... In all seriousness, I think it would be an amazing concept if Lotor helped Keith with his similar issues. In general I need more information about Lotor's character. He's a pretty badass villain.An actual Klance fic i made that also involves season 5:http://archiveofourown.org/works/13575798/chapters/31158543

Coran: i still dont trust himAllura: he's been here for like two days calm downCoran: first our cover is blown by Zarkon and his loyal soldiers and now his son is here... it's just weirdAllura: he also defeated Zarkon. The very person who destroyed Altea.Coran: what's next??? he's gonna want to be emperor??
{So we have news lol group chat}
 Lotor: yo i should be emperor Lance: ...yeah noCoran: is it too late to say "i told you so"Allura: shush Coran ily but now is not the timeAllura: What exactly do you mean, Lotor?Lotor: Right now, since Zarkon has been defeated, everyone will be wanting to be next in line for the throne. But that power in the wrong person's hands and your coalition could be hecka screwed. I am on your side and I desire what you desire. It's an easy compromise for us all- Voltron will be an ally rather than a foe, and I can carry out what I've always wanted: peace, acceptance. We can't throw away this shot.Pidge: /refrains from making a Hamilton reference/Allura: I agree.Lance: Sounds a tad power-hungry... But I admit it's all around better to have Lotor in power. At least we... know him... moreLotor: Thanks, LanceLance: i still hate youLotor: notedCoran: i suppose.... i agree tooAllura: But we are forgetting something.Shiro: Right, the lions. We can't be exposed.Allura: The Galra still want Voltron, and if we help you, Lotor, we'll be walking into a trap. Shiro: And there's no guarantee you'll even become emperor. We could be risking it all for nothing.... Lotor: It's risky, but so are our very lives, Princess.Shiro: Actually, I think I have an idea

Chapter Notes

Team Voltron has gone idle


At Haggar/Honerva's
haggar: kuron, you have brought lotor to meshiro: yes, masterhaggar: and you've taken care of the team?shiro: as much as i could without them realizing the game at playhaggar: hmm. you've done an effecient amount of work for now. girls?
acxa, ezor and zethrid have arrived
acxa: yes, haggar?haggar: i present you prince lotorlotor: ALLURA I CAN EXPLAIN- ooh na na how did i get here
haggar has changed their name to honerva
honerva: my son. you are home to me at last.lotor: i am NOT your son. and if you think i'm surrendering, you have another thing coming, asshathonerva: such a shame. we could've ruled together, mother and son, the most powerful beings in all the galaxy. it appears, however, that i must rid of you.lotor: i. am. not. your. son.acxa: stand down, haggarhonerva: after all i've done for your miserable souls you dare point that gun at me! if you're so loyal, perish with him if you wish!
honerva has left
acxa: damn, left before i could do anything. lotor? our orders, sir?lotor: take me to team voltron.
honerva: shiro. your time has comeshiro: what is my task?honerva: to make voltron fall into my trap. you have the deepest connection with one of the paladins- use that to our advantage. the red one must still believe precious shiro is still within you. you must lure him to you and distract him away from the team. if you have to kill...then kill.shiro: yes, haggarhonerva: perfect. then i can finally have everyone under my strings.
keith: shiro? shiro? it's me! where'd you go? i just want to talk.shiro has enteredshiro: keith. you've made it.keith: shiro!!! are you okay? what's wrong?shiro: oh, i'm better now.keith: um, really? you kinda knocked everyone out back there. what happened?shiro: glimpses... of the past. they can be powerful.keith: i'm aware.keith: well, we have to be heading back. lotor's gone and- where did you put lotor? do you remember anything?shiro: oh, keith...shiro: none of us are going anywhere
