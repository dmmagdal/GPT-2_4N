Chapter 1



Hoseok is mean. He’s mean and no one seems to catch wind of it but you. It’s intentional of course, like everything Jung Hoseok does. It’s all a carefully devised and well thought out ruse—so much so it makes you wonder if he maps out entire situations just to figure out the best way to get under your skin. Not that you could ever say that of course, because it would sound ridiculous. Hoseok was the most well liked guy on campus. His popularity and sunny disposition had been a running theme of every school he’d graduated with you from. And you were well …. You liked to think that every person had their own story—one that was outlined, drafted and proof read by outside forces, forces greater than you. And so by effect everyone was the main character in their own story, that didn’t necessarily mean they were a main character in someone else’s. You weren’t even supporting casts in other people’s stories much less a main character but that didn’t mean you weren’t important!However, you once tried explaining this logic aloud and Hoseok had mocked you mercilessly for it. All behind closed doors of course. He said it was your way of coping with being a giant nerd. And it’s not that you cared about his opinion, he was just annoying. A pest. His jokes never bordered on any real cruelty—at least not a brand that you couldn’t tolerate but the point was Jung Hoseok had a mean streak and you’d known about it since the two of you were still playing in the sandbox. In fact, your first recollection of him was from the sandbox. Even then he’d been well liked—drawing the attention of your older brother, Namjoon. The two of you had just moved to the town you’d end up growing up in—a lovely byproduct of your parents divorcing. Your dad would go on to get full custody of the two of you (not that your mom had put up a real fight) and while you’d been devastated to leave your friends behind, he had promised you’d like your new home better. Would even grow to love it. You, being the intelligent six year old you were had been rightfully doubtful about that. But then you found out your new home was bigger, it had a pool! And the town had an amusement park and shopping malls and a build-a-bear and a bunch of other things you didn’t have back at your old home! Not to mention, your new house was across from a playground! It had a big kid swing and everything and you couldn’t wait—could barely contain your excitement when you’d helped lug in the last box, one full of stuffed animals your grandma had sent you. Your brother however, considered it to be less than ideal and part of it had to do with him being a lot more put out by the divorce than you were. But another part of it had been because it meant he would be stuck with you. The words “take your sister” were ones he was intimately familiar with and dreaded. And in the end, you’d wonder maybe if you hadn’t been forced to be with Namjoon maybe you never would have met Hoseok. Maybe if your brother hadn’t been so impressed with his bike and lack of a helmet rule like your dad had in place for the two of you—maybe you wouldn’t be subjected to your own personal hell for the next fifteen or so years. You had always been on the shyer side and at six years old you’d both admired and were (rightfully) scared of the boy who was three years older than you. He hadn’t been alone that day as you recall—Yoongi, Taehyung and Jimin were in a distant memory. Namjoon had bonded with them almost immediately, jumping head first into their elaborately planned game of cops and robbers. And you, well … you did your best to keep up, but your six year old legs could only carry you so far and if you thought Namjoon was hard to keep up with, the other boys made him look like a turtle. Namjoon absolutely adored Hoseok and why wouldn’t he? Hoseok was so nice and friendly and he reminded you of sunshine even then. So when you’d tripped on your shoelace trying to keep up with them, skinning your knee in the process, you’d been grateful Hoseok was the one who’d stopped running. Your brother had been too engrossed in their game, otherwise he would’ve stopped too. Not because he was worried about you, only because you were crying and he was worried about getting in trouble. “What happened?” Hoseok asks curiously, head quirked to the side. Chubby fists come up to rub over your leaking eyes, lip jutted out, “I … I f-fell.” “Why’d you go and do that for?” Hoseok asks. “I didn’t mean it. It was an accident,” you sniffle, glancing down at your untied shoes. You usually wore Velcro’s but your dad had accidentally boxed them up so you were stuck with the stupid Dora Explorer tennis shoes. “Is it because of your shoe?” He asks, making no move to help you. His line of questioning was distracting enough that you don’t realize you’re not crying anymore. Well, that wasn’t entirely true. There were still tears, but you weren’t wailing like you had been before. You nod at him. “Why don’t you tie it then?” He points out. He’s weird. He asks a lot of questions and he’s weird, you think. But Namjoon liked him and your brother was your best friend even if you weren’t his. “I don’t know how,” you explain with a pout, “Do you?” “Of course. I learned it when I was your age,” he shrugs. “Can you tie my shoe then?” You ask, extending your little leg, blood dripping down from your knee. Hoseok stares at you for a moment in contemplation before he makes his a face. “No,” he shakes his head. You frown. “Well why not?” “I just don’t wanna,” he shrugs. “Why not?” You repeat yourself, feeling the tears well up all over again.“You’re a baby and I don’t want to play with you,” he accuses. “But you play with Namjoon,” your lip quivers. “And that’s my brother.” “Namjoon’s cool. Bet he even knows how to tie his shoes. ‘Sides you’re a girl,” he says as though that explains everything, “Girls is supposed to play house and stuff.” “I can play whatever I want to play!” You say, petulantly. “Well not with me,” Hoseok sticks his tongue out at you, “Baby.” He kicks some sand at you with his foot before running off after the other boys. That would end up being the first in a long line of unfortunate encounters with Jung Hoseok. .You and Jeon Jungkook are the same age. This detail would be one you fixate on for an entire year when you turn ten. Because Jungkook was a welcome guest to their stupid club but you weren’t. Because as Jung Hoseok had put it (still), you would only slow them down if you tried to ride bikes with them. Now, he hadn’t said this to anyone but you of course, and it was only after he’d taken the air out of both your tires, forcing you to stay back while your dad pumped them. You’d glared at him that day, arms crossed against your chest while he played innocent. “Oh no,” Hoseok’s brow furrows, “I have to be home soon. Do you think it’ll be done quick?”Your dad rubs the back of his neck with a sigh, “It would’ve been quick but I can’t seem to find the pump anywhere.” Hoseok worries his lower lip and you roll your eyes. You don’t know where the pump is but you’re positive Hoseok has something to do with it. “Dad,” Namjoon whines, sending your an annoyed look, “c’mon, the suns gonna set soon.” “It’s not my fault, Namjoon. I didn’t take the air out of my tires,” you retort. “And neither did any of us, so I don’t see why we have to wait for you,” he shots back with a glare.“Namjoon,” Hoseok calls softly, “it’s okay, really. I guess I can be late for dinner.” “But your mom will get mad at you. It’s not fair,” Namjoon objects immediately. “Besides, ___ doesn’t have to come with us everywhere go.”  “But—“ you splutter. “It’s okay, sweetheart. I could take you to the park,” your dad promises, a hand on your head. “Why don’t you boys head on out?” Hoseok smirks behind your dads back. I did it, he mouths to you and your eyes widen. “But—“ “Alright, bye dad,” Namjoon says, sending you one last look. You didn’t want to go to the park with your dad. He was too … he was too over protective and annoying. He did nothing but fuss over you and without your brother to help divide his attention it was miserable. But that was besides the point. The point was that Jungkook and you were in the same grade and you even tutored  him in math and yet you weren’t old enough to hang out with them! It wasn’t like you didn’t have your own friends—you knew a couple of girls in your neighborhood, even sat next to them on the bus ride home from school. But it was the principle! And there was no one to place the blame on except Hoseok. .“Give it back, Hoseok!” You bark, but it’s no use—he’s never listened to you before, why would you start now? “Why? I thought it wasn’t a diary,” he jeers with a grin, holding the notebook above his head. At sixteen, Hoseok was still immature. It was a wonder really, how anyone could think he was cool. Including your brother, who was currently in the shower—which explained Hoseok’s presence in your room. He wouldn’t dare enter if Namjoon were around. It was against guy code afterall. Didn’t matter how old you were or what his intentions were (to annoy you to death), you were off limits and by effect, so was your bedroom. You had been minding your own business—earphones in as you went over your algebra homework. You hadn’t even heard Hoseok come in, you definitely hadn’t heard him rummaging through your things. Because if you had, you would have been mindful of the way you sang off key to Jesse McCartney. You also wouldn’t have tried your hand at moonwalking in fuzzy socks—and as a result, tripping over your rug. He had been laughing so hard he nearly dropped the phone he was using to record the entire thing. Still, none of that was worse than what he held in his hands currently. “It’s not! It’s my English journal!” You cry out, hopping uselessly to try to get it from him. He turns his back to you as he flips through the pages. “What do we have here?” He teases, “Oh! A poem!” “Stop, Hoseok! It’s not funny!” You jump on his back when he doesn’t immediately give in. Hoseok chokes audibly when you put him in a headlock with your elbow. Still, he persists in the endless pursuit of embarrassing you, “Bonded to you in emotional bliss, engulfed in contentment…!” “HOSEOK!” You screech. Of course. Of course he would turn to what is quite arguably the most embarrassing page. “I open to you in total trust,” he sighs, pressing a hand to your forehead, “You are my everything! My refuge! Min Yoongi! You…” You both freeze. Hoseok sputters, eyes moving rapidly over the page as he rereads that last part one more time. He chokes, “Min Yoongi? Yoongi? OurYoongi?!” Hoseok’s red in the face, both from the way you choke him and from laughing so hard. “Oh my fucking God. I can’t,” Hes crying. He’s actually crying laughing. “I can’t believe—!” You manage to snatch the notebook from him, but only after grabbing him by the hair. Unfortunately for you, nothing could take this moment away from him. You could have a gun to his head and he’d still be peachy fucking keen. “You—“ he gasps, clattering to your bedroom floor, “—and Yoongi! Oh my God!” You sit on his stomach, yanking his head in every which way, hands clenched with fist fulls of hair. “Shut! Up!” He’s about to pass out. He really is. His stomach actually hurts from how hard he’s giggling. “I can’t wait to tell him,” he cries out, grabbing you by the wrists and shoving you off of him. You wince when your butt hits your bedroom floor. “Hoseok, you can't!” You cry, crawling on your knees towards him as he flips through your notebook frantically. “I love you so deeply,” he recites, “I love you so much!” His eyes scan over the pages with glee. “Hoseok!” You whine, uselessly. “Please!” “Min ___, Yoongi and ___ forever,” he breathes before looking up at you—dead serious. “You do know I have to tell him this, right?”“Please, please, please, Hoseok,” you beg desperately. “I’ll do anything.” He pauses at that. “Anything?” He cocks a brow. You exhale deeply—sadly, looking down at your hands as you nod, “Anything.” You had already known Jung Hoseok was a brand of evil unlike any other. You did not know that Jung Hoseok was the make you eat dog food with milk like cereal, evil. .Fourteen was a weird age for many reasons. You’d only had a year of experience being a teenager and while you thought you were getting the hang of it, that didn’t mean you didn’t slip up every now and then. Not to mention, high school was overwhelming and one might think attending school with their older sibling would be a little more reassuring but— “___, you do this every single time,” Namjoon sighs, slamming his locker shut to look at you. “And you would think that one of those times you would’ve believed me,” you exasperate. “I’m being serious, Joonie.” “Look,” Namjoon says, “we’re not kids anymore and quite frankly it’s not cute.” “Good, because I’m not trying to be cute,” you snap back, grabbing him by the arm when he tries to walk away. “You know what I mean,” he huffs, brow furrowed.“I don’t,” you reassure. Namjoon pins you with a ‘are you serious’ look and you reciprocate with what you hope is a ‘hell yes’ expression. He crosses his arms over his chest, “Your crush on Hoseok.” Your jaw actually drops. “My what now?” You gawk. “Look, he told me, okay? And I don’t want to talk about this anymore than you do—it’s awkward. So if you have to do this whole teenage girl crush thing could you please do it with someone else other than my best friend?” Namjoon grumbles. “What the hell did he tell you? Was it that he told yet another boy I like that I sprinkle kitty litter in my oatmeal because that’s what I came here to talk to you about,” you snap. Your blood boils at the reminder and you would think after four or so crushes you would get used to the unbearable troll ruining your life but nope! When Sana had told you during fifth period today you’d been so angry you’d forgotten your lunch when you stormed out to find your brother. Your stomach was now paying the price! So on top of everything else you were hangry. You could quite possibly kill Hoseok today. Finally. “You really expect me to believe that?” Namjoon blinks, “You expect to believe that Hoseok the same guy who drove across town when you were home sick to get you your favorite donuts from Barnies, did that?” “Yes, I do because I told you he licked every single one and then played the video of him doing so on his phone after I ate them,” you throw your hands up. “Do you hear how crazy you sound? Don’t you think if Hoseok was really like that I would’ve figured it out after all these years?” His brow furrows. “I mean I was hoping so but that was six years and three training bras in the freezers ago!” You glare. “And what exactly did he tell you happened between me and him?” Namjoon sighs deeply, “He told me he found your diary while he was looking for his notes he forgot at our house.” “And?” “And that he’d read all of your love poems about him on accident and when you walked in you’d been so hysterical you shouted at him until he left,” Namjoon shrugs. Your jaw goes slack. A common theme for today, it seems. “The hell I did! I would never have a crush on Jung Hoseok in a million years!” You seethe, “Even if he was the last guy on earth and it were up to us to save the human race!” “___!” Namjoon’s eyes widen. “No, Namjoon! I’m sick of it! I’m sick of you and I’m sick of your stupid friend who’s side you always take over me—your actual sibling!” You stamp your foot. “___,” Namjoon tries again but you’re too hot to care. “Jung Hoseok is the bane of my existence. I hate him and the world would honestly be a better place if he just fell off one day,” you scoff, “When are you gonna finally realize that your stupid friend is the literal skid mark on my life, huh? He’s annoying and he thinks he’s funny when he’s not and he thinks he’s so cool and that every girl is in love with him when really he sucks as person and he’s not even that good looking anyw—“ “___!” Namjoon repeats, but this time it’s said in a tone that’s much harder to ignore. “What?” You snap back, but Namjoon only clenches his jaw at you and in the end he doesn’t need to reply. Because when you turn around to see what he was throwing a hissy fit about, Hoseok’s right there staring at you expectantly. “Hoseok,” you breathe out. “You’re here.” He extends his hand and a familiar brown bag is crumpled in his fist, “You forgot your lunch. I told Sana I would give it to you.” You open and close your mouth a few times like a fish before giving up entirely. Namjoon couldn’t read the expression on his friends face and if he couldn’t then you sure as hell couldn't but you still felt like shit nonetheless. “I should get going,” he says after an excruciatingly awkward moment. “Hoseok—“ Namjoon starts, but his friend is already turning on his heel and walking in the opposite direction. Your brother turns to glare at you, “Are you happy now?” Your eyes flutter shut in defeat. . The answer was no. One would think after a week long vacation from the demon spawn himself you would be ecstatic, well rested flourishing. You’d finally gotten what you wanted—Hoseok to leave you alone, after all this time! But if that were true, then why did you feel so bad about it? Surely he had to know none of that stuff was true. Objectively speaking, Hoseok was … cool. Maybe not to you but that was only because he was so annoying all the time. However if the circumstances were different, you could very much see his appeal. Hoseok was nice and he could be charming when he wanted to be—a natural flirt as Sana would call him. He had all the makings of the perfect boyfriend which explained why every girl in your grade was in love with him. Why they constantly came up to you to ask you if he was single—as if you would know just because you were unfortunate enough to ride home with him from school everyday. And while those car rides were irritating at best, what with him constantly being fake nice to you in front of the guys and then insisting on sitting in the back with you just so he could pull your hair when no one was looking—it was nothing compared to what they were like now. Awkward, tense and him trying to put as much space between you as possible. You were still upset however because Hoseok was a generally upsetting person in your life but now you felt something else. Something that made it hard to focus on studying, and difficult to do anything but steal secret glances at him in the backseat to see why he was being so quiet. You felt guilty and it was driving you to do things that were totally out of character. Take now for instance as you stood outside the school, late enough that everyone had left for the day—including your brother who you’d lied to about a group project. When really, you were hoping to talk to Hoseok. You’d heard through the grapevine that he had a makeup test to finish and this was really your only opportunity to speak to him ... alone, now that he avoided you like the plague. Your tummy was in knots, hands wringing together nervously as you practice the same apology you’d spent most of the day coming up with. “Hoseok, I’m sorry. What I said was totally out of line and you’re right to stop talking to me. Also, you’re not entirely ugly,” you stop pacing to curse yourself. “No—Hoseok, I’m sorry but you’re a jerk to me and sometimes I lose my temper but you’re not a skid mark and it was rude of me to—God, why is everything I’m saying coming out wrong?” You groan aloud, before throwing yourself down on one of the picnic tables. You hit your head against it repeatedly, “Stupidstupidstup—“ “Uh, are you okay?” You shoot upright—a little too quickly, throwing your balance off until you’re tipping over with a yelp. “Shit,” Hoseok curses when you land on your ass, hitting your head on the way down. “Be careful.” “It was an accident,” you mutter softly, lifting up your hand with a wince. It was bleeding. “Ow.” Hoseok crouches down at your side, grabbing your hand before you can pull away. “What’d you go and do that for?” You frown at him. “I didn’t do it on purpose. Plus, you scared me,” you accuse before pulling back with a hiss when he runs a thumb over it. “Don’t touch it!” “Don’t be such a baby,” he rolls his eyes, “You should go to the nurse and have her clean it. You have little pebbles in the cut—could get infected.” He smooths a thumb over your palm—unconsciously soothing you. When he leans his head down he blows on it softly like you’re a little kid. You can’t help but stare at him—he was so different from the Hoseok you knew normally. The one who teased and antagonized you beyond comprehension. His hands were even gentle on your own, warm and soft and so big in comparison. You wonder what it would be like if you interlaced fingers.  You freeze at the thought, suddenly aware of the fact that Hoseok has your hand lifted a few inches from his lips, still attempting to cool the sting with his breath.  “It’s fine,” you pout, yanking your hand back from his. You momentarily forget that it’s cut and end up wincing from the pain again. “I’m fine.”Hoseok sends you a confused look, but just shrugs in the end. You were such a weird little girl. “What are you doing here anyway? I texted Namjoon I was gonna stay back—did he wait for me?” He asks, brow furrowed and it’s been so long since you’ve had a normal conversation with Hoseok you almost didn’t know how to respond without shouting at him or throwing things. “No. He,” you clear your throat when he helps you up to your feet with a strong arm. He’s still in his uniform, this time sporting a letterman jacket the school allowed for in the fall. His blue and yellow striped tie is done haphazardly—like he’d tugged on it towards the end of the day—and his hair is messily shoved off his forehead, a look you weren’t accustomed to. You don’t mean to stare, but you do. “Hello,” Hoseok calls, waving a hand in front of your face, “Earth to space cadet.” “What?” You ask dumbly. “I said what are you still doing here?” He sighs. You suck in a deep breath at the reminder. Right. You were here on a mission, “I came … I’m here to apologize.” Hoseok crosses his arms over his chest, “Yeah?” “Yes,” you look down at your feet—it’s a show of respect that you don’t usually gift him with. Not that he was any deserving of it! He didn’t act like someone older than you, so why should he be treated like one! You shake your head at the thought, “I’m sorry for how I talked to you the other day.” “You weren’t talking to me,” he scoffs, “you were talking about me. Behind my back.” “It was just Namjoon—!” You begin to object but the stern look he gives you has you retreating like a puppy with its tail tucked. “I mean … I know. It was wrong of me to do that.” “Why?” He asks. You frown in confusion, “Why, what?” “Why was it wrong for you to talk about me like that?” He asks, eyebrow raised “You’re apologizing, right? Shouldn’t you know what for?” “I guess …. I guess because,” you bite your lower lip in contemplation, “Because your Namjoon’s friend.” “That’s it?” He scoff, getting ready to walk away. You grab him by the wrist before he can do so. “Wait!” You call and when he turns back around you gulp audibly. Hoseok glances down at where your hand is still in his and you drop it hastily. “Not just that but because you’re … I wouldn’t call us friends but we’re close even if you annoy me. You’re my o—“ You cut yourself off before you can put the last nail in the casket of your dignity. Hoseok seems to pick up on where you’re taking that sentence, however. He was always annoyingly perceptive when it came to you. Whether it be knowing what room you’re in in your house, or knowing just what button to push to annoy you. “I’m your …?” He presses, taking a step towards you.You walk backwards. God, you think, he’s really gonna make me say it isn’t he? “Yermaiohsh,” you mumble quickly. “What was that?” Hoseok raises a brow, and the fact that he doesn’t stop making his way towards you is alarming. You felt cagey—like a feral animal, “I can’t hear you.” You repeat yourself and this time it’s even more indiscernible. “Speak up,” he demands and you’re so busy refusing to turn your back on him that you don’t realize there’s a curb behind until you’re tripping and falling back. Your eyes screw shut, body tensing as you brace yourself for a fall that never comes. And it never comes because there’s a strong arm banded around your waist. You’d never thought Hoseok to be strong—not once in the eight years you’ve known him. He’d always been lanky and long limbed. The abs he brandished in cringey, mirror pictures on Facebook, were more so a result of having no body fat than actually working out. But right now, with his arm around your waist and your hands crushed against his chest, trapped between your bodies—he felt pretty damn strong. You gulp nervously. Hoseok is otherwise unfazed. You’re about as physically appealing to him as a houseplant. “You’re such a klutz,” he rolls his eyes at you and misses the transfixed expression you’re wearing, a glossiness to your eyes that wasn’t there before, as you stare at him. Hoseok was strong and he smelled good and there were currently butterflies wreaking havoc on your belly because he was holding you and every time you breathed your chests brushed. You can’t remember the last time you’d been this close to him and not felt something other than violent. Well, that’s not true—you felt violently attracted to him in this very moment. “Oppa,” you whisper, looking more than a little dazed. Hoseok’s brow furrows in confusion. You’re staring at him—like, really staring at him. And not in a murderous way. He can’t quite pin the look on your face, but it doesn’t matter anyway. Not when satisfaction was curling deep in his belly, a smirk tugging at his lips when he notes the red tinge to your cheeks. You’d lost to him. All was right in the world. Hoseok’s job was done for the day and then some because he knows it’s killing you on the inside. There’s no other logical explanation to how flushed you were. Hoseok snickers. He isn’t sure why you hating him brought him so much glee. He just know you were fun to tease. Hoseok had never had much of a mean streak—always been so calm and content. His mom even went as far as to tell him that he’d barely cried as a baby. Jung Hoseok has been laid back his entire life, but for some odd reason—ever since you were kids, he took great joy in annoying you. It was almost therapeutic. “That’s right,” he grins and he doesn’t realize he’s still holding you. He doesn’t realize the reason your hearts beating so fast isn’t from fury but … from something else. “You’re a real dummy, you know that?” You frown at that and Hoseok’s smile broadens impossibly. He’s positively beaming at you.“I can’t believe you really bought that act earlier,” he snickers and you’re still a little confused. “Come on now—you don’t think I actually care that you don’t like me, do you?” You wiggle out of his hold then, digging deep for the anger you’d come to associate so well with Hoseok. But you kept coming up empty. You felt the overwhelming need to twirl a strand of your hair the longer he looked at you. “You came crawling back like a good puppy though, didn’t you?” He coos patronizingly, going to tickle a hand under your chin. You don’t slap his hand away like he expects you to—instead you let it happen before glancing down at your shoes nervously. Hoseok frowns, “Why are you being weird?” You shrug at him, not trusting yourself to talk right now. “Oh, I get it,” he wags a finger at you, “this is a new tactic, isn’t it? You think by ignoring me, I’ll stop bugging you? Jokes on you, puppy—I like an easy target.”And an easy target you were—or rather, your heart was because at the sound of such a patronizing nickname you should’ve been upset, annoyed, fuming like you usually were when he got like this. But all you could do was put a hand over your rapidly beating heart. “I have to go,” you mutter suddenly but before you can go, Hoseok grabs you by the back of your backpack. “Up up up—not so fast, puppy,” he lays it on extra thick, watching you carefully. Because despite his earlier declaration of being unbothered by your lack of a response to his taunting, he was just that. Bothered. “Where do you think you’re going?” “I’ve got a book report to do,” you say quietly, looking everywhere but at him. Hoseok narrows his eyes at you—not trusting your little innocent act. He grips you by the chin when you don’t look at him, bringing his face closer to yours curiously. Your eyes widen and you pull back in horror. “You’re being weird.” He accuses, “I don’t know what you’re up to but just know I’ll find out. So whatever prank you’re planning you better just forget about it because I promise my retribution will be so much worse.” “Fine. Whatever. I’ve got to catch the bus,” you scramble to get away but he just scoffs, dragging you behind him by the backpack like you were a doll. “Yeah right. Think you’re gonna get Namjoon all upset with me because I let you ride the city bus. I’m not stupid, puppy, you’re gonna have to do better than that. My dad let me use his car today. I’m taking you home,” he informs and your heart feels ready to burst out of your chest. (Hoseok reverses out of his senior parking spot that day with one hand behind your headrest and you know for a fact that the way your stomach flutters in response is a big, big problem.).In the end it would take him a good three years to understand it all. Three years for him to connect the dots as to why when he annoyed you, you just took it—no screaming or shouting or promising retribution. Three long years of annoying you to no avail only to be disappointed when you stop telling Namjoon on him. It’s somewhere between the way you leave a room anytime he enters and how you stopped riding with him and Namjoon the rest of their senior year, but instead chose to walk to your dads office—a block from school but a ways from your neighborhood. Something Hoseok knew for a fact you hated doing because it meant you had to stay there until he was done for the day. He had been wary at first when you had started to go quiet—clearly you had been planning something. Something big and Hoseok was a little uncomfortable. It isn’t until he traps you in your kitchen on the night of your birthday party that he figures it out. He’s back from college and he misses you—well, he missed bugging you, but still. And in a way, he missed it for a while. Even before he left for college. You’d shut him out and he didn’t like that. You’d ignored him all summer for three summers in a row when he was now going to school hundreds of miles away. The least you could do was entertain him a little bit while he was home! Or tell him what he did wrong! But no!“I know your game,” He scoffs at the way your eyes widen in alarm. He’s trapped you in the kitchen—the house being off limits to most partygoers unless they needed to use the restroom. It’d begun to get too hot outside so you decided to take a break from it all and cool off. Namjoon was drunk. His friends were drunk. Your extended family was beyond drunk and belligerent and your dad having spent an entire day at the grill had been working on catching up to everyone. Which left you and Hoseok in your kitchen—his arms caging you in on either side of the counter and his face close enough to yours that you can smell the beer on his breath. His cheeks are slightly flushed. He’s not as far gone but he’s getting there. “Hoseok,” you splutter. “Oppa, brat,” he corrects with a scowl and your cheeks redden. You clear your throat, “What are you doing in here?”“I finally figured out why you’re ignoring me—why you’ve been ignoring me, all these years.” He smirks at you and your heart skips a beat. “Hob—“ you wince when he sneers at you, jaw clenched and looking like a force to be reckoned with. You decide to go with a gentler approach to things, “O-Oppa.” It seems to appease him enough that his body relaxes the slightest. “You’ve been drinking a lot—why don’t you go lie down in Joonies room?” You offer, placing a gentle hand against his chest to push him off. He grabs you by the wrist, “You don’t get to dictate to me. I’m older than you. I decide what we do and when we leave and when you get to talk.” Your jaw drops in disbelief. He couldn’t be serious right now. “What did you just say to me?” You gawk and the embers of annoyance you haven’t felt in a long, long time seem to ignite themselves in your belly. “You heard me,” he scoffs, “I finally know your game.” “What game?” You ask, brow furrowed and when you try to wriggle out of his grasp he only tightens his hold, getting closer until there was no space left between your pelvises. He could probably feel your heart hammering in your chest—that’s how close he was. And Hoseok, in true Hoseok fashion was unfazed by it all. “Why you cut me off out of nowhere—I know what this is. I know why you leave a room anytime I walk in and why you always ask Joon if I’m going to be somewhere before you show up. I know why you picked up all those extracurriculars our senior year so you weren’t home as much. Why the second you got your license you were like a ghost,” he chuckles and you freeze. No. He couldn’t. He couldn’t possibly know when you’d taken such great care to make sure he didn’t. To make sure it wasn’t obvious. … could he? “W-What are you doing?” You stammer when his face is so close to yours you have to crane your neck back to look at him. “You’re playing the long game, ___ and it took me a while to figure it out,” he murmurs, “but all of this was a ruse wasn’t it?” Your eyes flutter shut in defeat. God—God, he knew. He knew and you felt like you might be sick. Because there was no telling what he would do with the information, there was no telling how much more he would torture you now that he knew your deepest darkest secret. That these last three years you’d been avoiding him like the plague because somewhere along the way you—“You just wanted me on my toes,” he grins suddenly and your eyes fly open, “that was the payback, wasn't it? You know that stupid saying how you’re more scared of the gunshot than the gun or whatever? You had me looking over my shoulder wondering when you were gonna just do it—whatever you were planning. And then I realized it today when you wouldn’t even look at me—that was the prank. Me, being paranoid all this time.” You look at him for a long moment—in stunned silence because he … could not be this stupid, could he? “I’ll give it to you, it was pretty amazing,” he laughs. He could, apparently. You’re about to agree to whatever the hell it was he just said—anything to get him off of you and as far away as possible but then he does the thing. The Hoseok Thing where he disarmed even the most cynical of women. You remember the first time you’d ever witnessed it—you’d still been too young to really comprehend it and too full of loathing for Jung Hoseok to understand how anyone found him appealing. Her name was Seulgi and she had been a senior, you think. You weren’t entirely sure but you knew she was older than Namjoon and Hoseok. Your dad had been gone on one of many business trips that would come when Namjoon entered high school because now your brother was actually old enough to be trusted at home alone. (Even if maybe he shouldn’t have been). He was having a party and so you were banished to your bedroom with an entire box of pizza and junk food from the mini mart he’d bribed you with. You were more than satisfied with your end of the deal and not really interested in what was going on downstairs. Your bladder however, had always been the size of a pea and when you had an entire liter of soda to yourself it didn’t make for a good combination. You’d been in the process of tiptoeing to the bathroom when you saw it. Hoseok was smooth even then—how else could an underclassman pull someone who was as popular and as pretty  as Seulgi? Of course, you’d only known that after eavesdropping on Namjoon and his conversations but looking at her you believed it. Your nose had scrunched in distaste because quite frankly she was too pretty for someone as gross as Hoseok but somehow even then you’d understood. He wasn’t the same Hoseok you’d grown up with in that moment. This was someone else entirely and in your young brain you were mildly intrigued by what was happening in your dads room. You don’t get to see much else however when he catches sight of you through the crack in the door—he’s already mid make out when you quirk your head at him curiously. He’d reached behind the girls back and shut the door—effectively shutting you out. You wouldn’t understand it until much later—the way guys like Hoseok made you want their attention, how they had a way of making every girl feel like they were the only girl they had eyes for. Guys like Hoseok made you crave the way they looked at you and spoke to you and it was dangerous. He was dangerous. But for now you were home free—or so you thought before all of it came crashing down around you like a house of cards. “You’re so smart, puppy,” he pets the top of your head gently and of course he didn’t mind your close proximity because he was Hoseok and he found you about as physically appealing as an eggplant. Everyone had their weaknesses, right? That stupid nickname he’d given you, while degrading as hell … did things to your insides. It dredged up all those old feelings that were still very much present every time he came home from college with Namjoon. It reminded you of that first day you realized you had … feelings for him and it didn’t help that the tone he used while saying it was much softer than the way he normally spoke to you. It was like he’d let loose a thousand butterflies in your belly.  Hoseok is expecting a number of reactions from you—annoyance at his patronizing tone, sadness at having been found out, anger at the old nickname resurfacing. What he wasn’t expecting is a different yet familiar emotion to flash over your features. Different because it’s never one you wore while in his presence, familiar because he’s seen it on girls before. Girls he’d flirt with innocently (or not), girls in his chem lecture when they asked to borrow his notes, girls at the bar on the few occasions him and Namjoon could go out. “What—?” he whispers in confusion but he can’t find the words. He doesn’t know what to say. But rather, he knows he has to test his theory.Hoseok cups your jaw gently, staring at you with the same sleepy look he had whenever he was drinking. Your breath catches in your throat and before you can stop yourself you’re looking down at his lips. It was apparently tell he was looking for. You wanted him to kiss you. “Oh my God,” he breathes, letting you go and taking a step back. You do the same—practically sprinting to the opposite end of the kitchen. It still wasn’t far enough from him for your comfort. “Oh my God,” Hoseok says again, laughing in disbelief. He cards a hand through his hair as he stares at you. “What?” You ask, arms crossed over your chest defensively. “You…” he begins pointing at you—but again, he comes up short. Hoseok’s finger turns to press against his chest, “.... And me.” Your cheeks heat with embarrassment and you have to clap your hands over them in an attempt to hide it. Hoseok is genuinely shocked. Genuinely. Because you and he were like oil and water—always had been, probably always would be. The last thing he’d ever expect was for you to have a crush on him! You hated him! Or so you claimed to. Before he can stop himself, like a kid who’d just found a new toy he’s walking back to you with a curious expression. “What are you d...oing?” You yelp when he presses a hand against the wall behind you like in all those romcoms you loved to watch. He leans in until your faces are too close for comfort. He removes it a few moments later, pulling back and you can’t hide the way your body sags with relief. Hoseok’s head quirks to the side before he's wrapping an arm around your waist, experimentally—hauling you against his chest. “Stop it!” you demand, attempting to shove him off and he lets you. He had to have because there’s no way in hell you were stronger than him. It takes you a minute but you realize he’s turning it on and off like a switch—or rather turning you on and off. “How interesting,” he breathes like he’s studying a science experiment and not a living, breathing human being. “W-What?” You rub your arms self consciously—putting a generous amount of space between you lest he decide to test his effect on you some more. “You—“ Before he can finish his sentence, the screen door is slamming, alerting the two of you that you had company. Namjoon peeks his head in curiously, “There you are! I was looking for you—Mina and her friend are here.” He’s looking at Hoseok who’s currently looking at you before tearing his gaze away. “Huh?” He asks, dumbly. Namjoon sighs, “Mina? Remember, I told you about her. The girl I’m talking to! She brought a friend over and I told her you would be out.” “Oh,” Hoseok says, nodding before sending you a peculiar look. “Right.” Your gaze falls to the floor in defeat. This was exactly what you didn’t want to happen, it was why you’d dodged Hoseok for so long because you knew that the second he found out things would be different. And you hated different. You didn’t want Hoseok to feel like he had to tip toe around you and you didn’t want things to be awkward. But that was the direction seems thing to be heading when he clears his throat and puts a hand on your brothers arm. “Let’s go then,” he mutters. .It’s unfortunate that you seem to have forgotten just who Jung Hoseok really was and the role he played in your life all these years. Maybe you were blinded by your crush on him or maybe it’s because it’s been so long since you’ve been in a situation where you’re forced to hold a conversation for longer than three sentences. But the point was that you’d forgotten what Hoseok was really like. That is until you’re going to college with him. Now, the school your brother had gone to was definitely not your first pick but when you were lucky enough to have a parent who was paying for your degree it meant dealing with them ultimately having the final say in where you attended. You could go off and move out and have the true college experience you’d been dying for, with one stipulation—you went to school with your big brother. Now under normal circumstances this wouldn’t have been too terrible if it weren’t for the fact that your brother lived with his best friend. And said best friend had every intention of torturing you the way he had growing up only … he had new material. “Can you scoot over?” You mumble as to not alert your brother to what was going on. “Hmm?” Hoseok asks, and he deserves an oscar for the way he pretends he is unaware of what he’s doing. He knows exactly what the hell he's doing because he’s been doin it for the last six months you’ve been living with him. He’s teasing you. And not in the conventional Hoseok way. His legs are spread apart and despite the fact that you had molded yourself against your arm of the couch, his thigh was still pressing against your own. You’d thought you had been home free when he got off work early tonight and made a beeline for his room. You shouldn’t have been so surprised when he’d come back out a minute later in those gray sweats. The pair you’d debated on sneaking into his room just to throw it out. The hood of his jacket was tugged up over disheveled hair and he was wearing glasses. He looked cozy and warm and … and so boyfriend, in that moment. You didn’t know what true hell was until he’d weaved his way around Namjoon’s couch and taken a seat next to you on the much smaller one. “I said can you move over,” you clear your throat. “Oh. Sorry,” Hoseok frowns, glancing down at your bare legs. You cover them self consciously.  It was too goddamn hot for you to be wearing pants tonight, not to mention he wasn’t even supposed to be here. “It’s o—“In Hoseok’s defense, he does move over—just not the way you want him to. He wraps an arm around back the of the couch and he’s pressed so hard and tight against you, you could feel him breathing. While his arm isn’t exactly touching you, his fingers are most definitely playing with a strand of your hair. “Better, puppy?” He asks, innocently. You suck in a deep breath before shooting to your feet. Your brother glances over at you curiously but Hoseok just stares like he’s unfazed. “Where are you going?” Namjoon asks. “To bed.” “But you asked me to rent this mo—“ he winces when you slam your bedroom door. “What the hells her problem?” Hoseok shrugs, “Maybe it’s that time of the month.” .Hoseok’s teasing only seemed to amplify the longer you stayed with him—he was always forgetting his clothes in the shower and walking out with nothing but a towel around his waist. When he wasn’t doing that he was sneaking up behind you to reach a cereal box over your head, molding his front to your back with a hand on your hip. His hand seemed permanently glued to the small of your back in that way that boys did when they were flirting with girls and he once drank your drink just to tease you about an indirect kiss when Namjoon left the room.  Jung Hoseok was driving you crazy and the worst part of it all was that you liked it and you liked him. You liked the attention he gave you even if you were furiously fighting it off with wide eyes and flushed cheeks. You’d never had a boyfriend—you barely even knew how to flirt with boys, so being around one who took the lead, even if it was just to tease you, was … exhilarating. It made you excited to wake up in the morning if only to see what stunt he was going to pull and it made you giddy whenever you saw him. And yet despite how much you liked it—this was all a game to Hoseok. So you couldn’t let your feelings win. “Morning, puppy,” Hoseok yawns and you ignore him, like you always do because responding only made it worse. “You back to ignoring me now?” “I’m not ignoring you,” you mumble, paying way too much attention to the eggs you were frying. “Feels like it,” he sing songs and when you eye him in your peripheral you note he’s already showered and dressed for the day. You clear your throat and turn the heat up on the stove, willing your eggs to cook faster. You didn’t make a habit of eating in your room but you would make an exception today because Hoseok seemed extra eager to annoy you. He proves your point when you’re suddenly surrounded by his scent—a spicy mix of cologne and laundry. It’s a wonder that you use the same laundry detergent and it somehow smells better when it’s on him. Hoseok winds an arm around your middle and you nearly drop the pan before he’s grabbing it by the handle. “Easy there,” he chuckles. You crane your neck to look at him, “Get off.” “You making some for me too?” He asks, ignoring you in favor of resting his chin on your shoulder. You suck in a deep breath. “If you promise to leave you can have it.” “But you didn’t make it especially for me,” he pouts and when you try to wiggle out of his hold he only leans in further—your cheeks are now smooshed together, “It won’t taste as good because you weren’t thinking of me while you made it.” “Ugh—God, Hoseok don’t you ever take a day off?” You groan, shaking him off of you. Finally. You felt like you could breathe again. “Nope,” he hums. His reflexes are too fast—much faster than yours but that wasn’t exactly a feat all things considered. He catches you before you get a chance to storm out of the room, leaning over the kitchen island to press a hard peck to your cheek that has your eyes widening. It was hardly anything to write home about but that … that was definitely new. Hoseok had never actually kissed you before. You press a hand to your already warm cheek. “See you after class, puppy,” he calls, snagging the piece of toast you made for yourself on the way out. You look up at the ceiling with a groan, wondering why god hated you.  . Hoseok teasing you was nothing new. You’d grown up with him after all and he treated you like it was his life’s mission to make you hate him. Not that you ever actually have. You really aren’t sure why when you think about it because you had more than enough ammunition to do so. You wonder if it has to do with you seeing him as a brother—you had grown up together, but that wasn’t true. Hoseok and Namjoon have never been in the same category for you. Not once. It’s something you mull over for the better part of your morning—only because you can  actually hear yourself think for once, with the absence of your roommates. Normally, Tuesday’s find you at the lecture hall but with classes canceled due to a personal emergency, you’re for once alone in the normally loud apartment. Between Hoseok speaking a decibel or deafening at all times and Namjoon just being an all around klutz and constantly breaking things, you rarely ever get any peace and quiet. So when you’d woken up realizing both boys would be gone for the day you’d nearly squealed with excitement. It was finally a chance to catch up with homework and clean up a bit—all the things you couldn’t get done around them you had every intention of doing today. But see, the way things workout when your in college is time seems to move exceptionally faster when you’ve got the day to yourself. One minute it’s ten AM and you’re scrolling through your instafeed under your covers—the next it’s one o’clock and your stomach is gurgling. You groan miserably, tossing the covers off of you with a curse because how could you have wasted half the day in bed? “So much for being productive,” you sigh, walking out of your bedroom and wincing at how bright it is in the common area. You’re halfway to the blinds when you hear it. A soft groan. You frown, head quirked to the side as you listen a little more intently. You could’ve sworn you were home alone—Namjoon even knocked on the door to tell you he and Hoseok were leaving for the day. At least you think he did. Well, he never specified him and Hoseok but you’d assumed. You knew their schedules like you knew your own—if only to avoid them altogether. Another groan has you pausing outside of Hoseok’s bedroom door, hand on the knob. “He wouldn’t…” you mumble to yourself, but your train of thought is already headed in that general direction. Surely no one actually moans when they were masturbating, right? That wasn’t like a real thing. It was just something that happened in books to amp up sexual tension. There’s no way in hell Jung Hoseok was behind that door jerking off that loudly with you three feet away. Unless ... unless he was and it was all to tease you. Like he’s been doing! He probably expects you to never be able to look him in the eye again, which honestly you probably would’ve done if it weren’t for that stunt he pulled the other day. The guy was all but taking you on the living room couch for the sake of a “joke” and quite frankly you were sick of it. You were sick of Jung Hoseok and you were sick of being the punchline to all of his jokes. You aren’t entirely sure what you had been expecting to walk into when you gripped the knob to his bedroom door open but surely it’s not him keeled over in bed. “Hoseok?” You call and you can barely make him out in the pitch darkness of his room. There’s clothes and expensive sneakers everywhere, making it more like a landmine than somewhere a human being could comfortably sleep. He groans again. “Hoseok are you—?” “No,” he whines, voice hoarse when you flood his room with light. “Off. Please.” You hesitate but turn around and switch the light off anyway. “Are you okay?” You ask. “Dying,” he croaks and you venture in further. “Is it—are you hungover?” You ask, sticking your arms out in front of you in case you run into anything. It isn’t until your shins hit what is presumably the front of his bed that you stop, hands out to feel around. His comforter is a little damp under your fingertips and you try not to imagine what from as you take a seat next to him. “No,” he shivers, “didn’t drink last night.” You press a hand to his forehead, “Oh, Hoseok—you’re burning up.” You go to move your hand away, but he curls into your touch, keeping a weak grip on your wrist. “C-cold.” “You probably have the flu,” you murmur, smoothing your hands over his sticky face. “It’s been going around campus lately.” He doesn’t say anything, just whines further and makes you sigh. “What are you feeling?” You ask and he holds your wrist so you don’t move your hand from his cheek. Your palm is small and a welcome cold against his hot skin. Your thumb runs absentmindedly over his face. “My throat hurts,” he says with a wince, “and my stomach and my entire body. I’m cold and hot at the same time.”“Sounds like the flu, Hobi,” you murmur. “I think I’m dying,” He whines softly and you roll your eyes at him. “You’re not dying.” You exasperate, attempting to extract yourself from his grip but all he does is lace an arm around your waist pathetically. He didn’t have the strength to keep you there but you do so anyway because it makes your heart race. “Please don’t leave me,” he pleads. “I need to run to the store. We don’t have any medicine because you and Namjoon are heathens and I finished all mine.” You explain, turning in his embrace to look at him.His face is a little swollen, and his complexion is almost gray in the dim light coming from the hall. You smooth a hand over his face, pushing the hair back from his forehead—it makes him all but pur against you. “I need to go get you some things to break the fever,” you say softly, “And you need to eat. Have you emailed any of your professors?” Hoseok shakes his head miserably. “My head hurts—can’t open my eyes.” “We’ll take care of that later, yeah?” You say and he nods. “Try and rest. I’ll be back before you know it.” “Get me Gatorade?” He asks, pitifully. “Sure,” you say. “The red one,” he burrows his head deeper into the pillow. You roll your eyes at him, “Okay, Hoseok.” “Oppa,” he corrects. You slam his door shut and he winces when he feels the sound radiate against his temples. .Hoseok, like all men, is unbearable to be around while sick. Not to be mistaken, you had lots of practice with your dad and your brother. Both of whom were regressed to age five when they were sick. Namjoon only ate a specific brand of chicken noodle soup when he had the flu—specifically one that was made from scratch and not store bought because it upset his stomach. Your father, while mildly better and way less picky, kept a bell at his bedside because he didn’t like to use his voice to call you. That in itself was its own special level of infuriating. But still, neither of them compared to Hoseok. Not in the slightest. Because Hoseok needed his pillow fluffed every thirty minutes or else he got a neck cramp and the neck cramp gave him a headache and the headache made him nauseous. And Hoseok couldn’t feed himself because he was too weak to even lift a spoon and that was why you needed to sit on the bed next to him to make sure he didn’t spill any on clothes. And Hoseok liked to watch TV when he was sick but if he couldn’t lift a spoon then god forbid he try and lift the god bless remote to change the station for himself. And all of that was annoying in itself but none of that topped today. Because Hoseok enjoyed reading—a hobby you didn’t realize he had because when he spoke he certainly did not sound like a man who has so much as looked as a book much less actually read one. That in itself was not the problem, the problem was Hoseok is currently invested in the Rick Riordan series which is a good read (well, from what you could remember of it from the sixth grade—but you weren’t one to knock a timeless classic), not so much fun to read when the person who has you narrating it wants you to use different voices for the characters. “Hoseok, if you’re still not feeling any better then maybe we should go to the doctor,” you sigh, putting the book down. The older boy actually pouts at you—arms crossed and everything. “I don’t have insurance,” he says. “Bullshit. You and Namjoon stayed in that line for free registration for like, an entire day. I remember because the two of you made me stand in line for you while you got Taco Bell,” you exasperate, “Look, I already missed two days of class for you. I can’t miss anymore.” “The semesters almost over!” He throws his hands up. “And if I thought like that then I’d be bordering on academic probation like you’ve been since you started college,” you roll your eyes, “Come here. Let me feel you.” “No!” He shouts so suddenly your hand freezes in midair. Hoseok chokes, “I mean … no. Your hands are always freezing. The cold makes me nauseous.” “Everything makes you nauseous, Hoseok,” your brow furrows and you press a hand to his cheek, “I’m worried about you. What if it’s something serious and you won’t know until it’s too late because you’re so stubborn.” Hoseok softens at your words—at the look you’re giving him, really. He doesn’t remember when you started to get so pretty, but he didn’t like it. He didn’t like that you got your braces off or that your hips had started to fill out (as well as a few other choice areas), he didn’t like that he couldn’t stop staring at your lips when you weren’t paying attention to him, or your eyes. He was more than a little concerned at how much he looked forward to teasing you. How much he liked crowding your space and letting his touch linger when Namjoon wasn’t looking. It was even more concerning now that you were in his bed with him—after you’ve been taking care of him for the last three days, all gentle touches and soft words and so … so utterly feminine, it did things to him. Hoseok was beginning to see you as a woman and nothing has ever horrified him more. “Will you miss me?” He murmurs, wiggling closer until he can rest his chin against your shoulder. “What?” You frown. “If I die,” he says, and a chill wracks your body when he nestles his head in the crook of your neck. That was certainly new. “You’re missing the point,” you exasperate, attempting to pull away. “Hoseok, what are you—?” Two strong arms wrap around your waist, huddling you closer until there’s no space left between your bodies. “You smell so good,” he sighs. “It’s called soap,” you say dryly. “And why are you so clingy all of a sudden? Cut it out.” “Why?” He whines and the further you try to move away, the further he moves in until he’s half on top of you. “Because my brother could walk in and get the wrong idea,” you remind. Hoseok doesn’t say anything, just holds you close like you'll eventually shut up if he ignores it long enough. In a way he’s right, because it felt good to be held. Especially by him. Hoseok was so warm and smelled so good and his fingers were rubbing circles against your skin. Somewhere along the way his hand finds your own, lifting it slowly like you won’t notice if he goes slow enough, until he puts it atop his head. “What are you doing?” You ask. “Play with my hair. I wanna go to sleep,” he mutters. “If I do this will you let me go?” you ask and Hoseok lifts a shoulder in a shrug. “Hoseok.” “Fine,” he grunts, “Play with my hair.” “What’s the magic word?” You sing song. Hoseok glares up at you, “Now.” You roll your eyes at him but oblige, fingers threading in his silky smooth hair. It was almost unfair really. Men deserved nothing. They didn’t deserve long eyelashes or flawless skin, or nice lips or perfect hair. At risk of sounding bitter, what do men do other than annoy you? You’re about to ask Hoseok as much when you feel him curve against, getting impossibly closer until his cheek is pressed right up against your boob, making the material of your shirt scrape over your nipple. Was it smart not to wear a bra to his room? Probably not but you weren’t exactly planning on letting him motorboat you over chicken noodle soup. “H-Hoseok,” you clear your throat, “Maybe we should…” It’s soft. So soft you wouldn’t have felt it were you not hyper aware of his presence right now. You couldn’t even call it a kiss, just a brush of his lips over the side of your breast. Your nipples pebble as if on command. “Hoseok,” you begin again, beginning to pull away. But the kisses don’t stop there. Oh no. They continue onto your bicep, peppered against the column of your throat, stopping only to kiss the spot between your collar bones, until you can feel Hoseok’s hair tickling your chin. Your eyes flutter shut briefly as you soak it in. The way Hoseok smells, how he feels, part of you wonders how he tastes but you weren’t bold enough to ask him for that. Not now, maybe not ever. You wish you could enjoy it. You wish you could say it felt right and that you could turn off your brain for one second and bask in Hoseok. Hoseok, the guy who’s sexual escapades were something short of legendary on campus. Hoseok, who all the boys wanted to be and the girls wanted to be with. Hoseok, who was the most popular boy on campus and had people constantly vying for his attention. Hoseok, the guy who used to pull on your pigtails until you were thirteen. The guy who could be sweet when he wanted to. The one who ‘accidentally’ tripped a guy at his high school graduation because he stood you up for a date two weeks before. Hoseok, the guy who pretended like he didn’t care, but you caught him every now and again doing just that. Caring. About you. The entire situation felt like an out of body experience. There were too many conflicting emotions, it was a system overload. It felt right and wrong at the same time. You liked it but it was weird. Foreign. You were too split down the middle to say whether or not you actually wanted this. He would be the second guy you would ever have sex with and for some reason that felt just as big as the first. You lost your virginity in high school and no one ever told you you’d need to lose it a couple more times before sex felt natural, til sex felt like something your body was made to do. All you knew now however was that your palms were sweating and your heart was racing and as good as Hoseok was making you feel . you couldn’t deny that he was also making you … uncomfortable. It wasn’t the kind of discomfort where you thought he would force himself on you, or wouldn’t take no for an answer. You liked Hoseok, you wanted this. But not now and not like this and you didn’t even know what ‘this’ was. You wish there was a rulebook that would explain your feelings to you, explain the messiness of intimacy and sex. Either way, you couldn’t ignore the feeling in your gut. “Stop,” You say so suddenly and so loudly that Hoseok all but flies across the room. “What are you doing?” “I-I…” Hoseok cards a hand through his hair and he looks just as distressed as you, just as confused too. Like he didn’t know what was going on either. “I’m sorry, ___. I’m so fucking sorry—Christ. Are you okay? Are you—?” It’s zero to sixty, one second he’s numb to it all and the next it’s all hitting him. You were in his bed, he was holding you and touching you and kissing you and not once did it feel wrong or bad. Not once did Hoseok stop to think that it was you. All he knew was you smelled good and you were soft in all the right places and he …“I didn’t mean for that to happen,” Hoseok rises to his feet, shoving his hair back from his face. You chance a look at him from beneath your lashes, tugging your shirt back up your arm from where he moved it. “God, I screwed up,” Hoseok puts his hands on his hips, “I’m sorry.” “It’s fine,” you clear your throat, and your voice sounds anything but fine. Quite the opposite in fact. Hoseok squeezes his eyes shut before turning to face you, “Are you … gonna tell Namjoon?” You go quiet at that, staring at Hoseok long and hard. “I mean I get if you do and I know I don’t deserve to ask you to you know, not do that. But it’d be really great if you didn’t do that.” Hoseok pleads. “If I didn’t do what? Tell my brother that his friend kissed my tit while I was taking care of him?” You blink and Hoseok winces visibly. “Look, I get if you do. I was out of line and that wasn’t cool of me—what happened … there,” he nods at his bed like he can’t say the words. “It was super douchey of me and I really didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable but if you tell Namjoon, I—well, that … I mean—“ You rise to your feet, grateful for the distance the bed puts between the two of you because if it weren’t for that, you’re positive your hands would already be around his throat. “You’re so full of shit, Hoseok,” you seethe and he nearly gets whiplash from how quickly your mood changes. “Excuse me?” He asks. “I said you’re full of shit,” you shove him out of the way so you can get to the small pile of things that had begun to grow the longer you stayed in here taking care of him. “Hey,” Hoseok barks, but all it takes is one look from you and it has him shutting up. “You’re pissed. I get it—“ “No. You don’t. You really, really don’t,” you snap, “All of this is a game to you and it’s fun, right? Well guess what Hoseok, it’s not a game to me. You always take things too far. That night on the couch, that stuff that happened in the kitchen and now this? How far are you willing to take your joke? What were you gonna sleep with me for a good laugh?” “I would never do that to you,” Hoseok says, sounding genuinely offended. “How could you ever think that?” “How couldn’t I?” You ask, scowling at him, “That’s it, Hoseok. This is it. No more poking fun at me, no more flirting with me or touching me when Namjoon’s not looking. I’m done.” “___,” Hoseok pinches the bridge of his nose in frustration, “This is all a misunderstanding, okay? I didn’t mean for that to happen.”“You never mean for things to happen, Hoseok,” you throw your hands up, “And that’s fine but I want you to stay away from me.” “But I—““Stay. Away. From. Me.” You demand and Hoseok’s hands fall to his sides, “I mean it.” “___!” Hoseok calls, but you’re already walking away from him, slamming his door shut so violently it’s a wonder you didn’t take it off it’s hinges. He throws himself on his bed with a groan, tossing the stupid Percy Jackson book digging into his side, at the wall. .Being angry with Hoseok was something you missed. Sure, the guy annoyed you and was entirely exasperating on a good day—but you’d hit a point some time ago where you liked him more than you loathed him. An issue that was no longer an issue after that day in his room. As long as you’ve known Hoseok, you have never had the upperhand. But, it turns out, he—like all men—had a weak point. And that was being freezed out. It was like the goddamn Cold War in your apartment and your brother did not understand it one bit. “Hey,” Hoseok says hesitantly and you don’t even look up from your spot on the couch. Your curled into one side of it with your computer in your lap, dressed in a blanket that has seen better days and your reading glasses. “Do you mind if I—“ No sooner is Hoseok planting his ass on the cushion are you standing up, ignoring the quizzical look your brother was sending you. “I’m gonna head out to the library,” you inform, “I’ve got a couple of things left to print out before class tomorrow and I don’t feel like getting up early. See you.” Hoseok sighs deeply. That was only one of many occurrences of which you’d ignored his existence entirely. You hadn’t mentioned a word to your brother, but Namjoon wasn’t stupid. You were all but announcing that you and Hoseok were beefing everytime you exited a room he just entered, or left Hoseok’s dirty dishes outside his bedroom door when he didn’t wash them fast enough for your liking. Or like now, for instance, when you— “Literally, what the fuck?” Hoseok growls, “Namjoon!” “What?” He groans, coming out of the bathroom—there’s a toothbrush jammed in his mouth that’s foaming over white. Hoseok gestures to his bed, or rather to the soaking wet heap on his sheets, “Who the fuck took my clothes out of the washer and didn’t dry them? I’ve got a date tonight and everything I own is dirty or smells like wet dog now.” “I don’t know.” He shrugs, before retreating back to the bathroom to spit, “My laundry slot isn’t until five thirty.” “Laundry slot?” Hoseok scoffs. And like magic—more specifically, a curse—you appear out of no where, toting a basket of freshly laundered and folded clothes, humming to yourself as though all was right in the world. And why wouldn’t it be? No one took your clothes out of the washer and left them on your bed. “___,” Hoseok barks and he feels his blood pressure spike when you saunter right past him, hips swaying as you make your way to your room. It doesn’t matter to him either because he’s grabbing you by the arm before he can think better of it. “___!” You whip around with a stare so venomous, Hoseok actually gulps. But whatever hesitation he was feeling is completely drowned out by his annoyance and before he knows it, he’s shoving you into your room and slamming the door. “Get out.” You demand. “What the fuck is your problem?” He seethes. “You, Hoseok. You’re my problem, in case that wasn’t clear enough.” You blink. Well damn, he thinks. You could at least pretend to care about his feelings. “You took my clothes out of the washer,” he says, keeping a tight grip on his irritation with you. It’s a little sad that he has to. It’s even more sad that it nearly evaporated when he got a look at your face—freshly scrubbed of makeup and reminding him of that seventeen year old girl he used to torment. “You’re washing outside of your time slot.” You explain, turning to put your basket down, because it was clear he wasn’t getting the fuck out. “What time slot are you and Namjoon going on about?” He groans. “I wouldn’t expect you to know since you’re literally the only person in this house that doesn’t follow any of the rules we have set up,” you scoff. “We have time slots, Hoseok. It’s how we do laundry so that we’re not all fighting for the washer at the end of the week. Me and Namjoon just go around whatever your schedule is, that’s why you don’t care. But things are different now. You have the washer on Monday’s and Tuesday’s. And also, stop leaving your clothes in the wash for someone else to put in the dryer because you’re too lazy to do it yourself.” “I do not do that!” He says. “You absolutely do that and me and Namjoon take turns putting your stuff in the dryer and then taking the laundry to your room for you to throw on the floor and then repeat next week.” You roll your eyes at him. “Why don’t you just tell me what this is really about instead of acting like a spoiled brat?” He accuses. “You don’t get it do you? This—all of this?” You gesture to the entire apartment, “Is what it’s all about. You’re a terrible roommate and I’ve bitten my tongue for too long.” “So you’re just gonna keep leaving my dishes outside of my door and taking away the key under the mat and hiding the milk—which by the way, why do you hide the milk?” He glares. “Because you always leave a little bit so that you don’t have to buy a new carton—not that you buy literally anything in this house and I took the key from under the mat because me and Namjoon were never comfortable with it but you just ignore us and do as you please. Despite the fact that I told you there had been a string of robberies in the complex! And maybe if you don’t want me to leave dishes outside of your door, you could try doing your fucking dishes!” You’re panting by the time you finish and Hoseok is positively pissed with you. “Wow.” He shakes his head in disbelief, “You’re fucking insane.” “I’m insane—?” Your eyebrows nearly shoot up to your hairline, “I’m insane? Hoseok, I have never met someone so painfully oblivious to the fact that they’re an asshole! You are an asshole!” “And you’re pretending that this isn’t about the fact that I kissed you the other day in my bed! I said I was fucking sorry! I didn’t mean it!” He yells. “You saying you don’t mean it doesn’t reverse what happened!” You bark back. “So are you saying you didn’t like it?” He returns, brow furrowed in annoyance. He didn’t mean to say that, but there was no turning back now. “I’m not saying I didn’t not like it!” Hoseok blinks at you. “What the fuck is that supposed to mean?” He practically shouts and you wince. “Am I supposed to be able to make sense of that?” Hoseok could be so loud and sometimes you forgot. “Well did you like it?” You ask angrily.“Of course I fucking liked it. I’m a guy, aren’t I? And those,” he gestures to your chest and you cover it with your arms, “Where the fuck did those come from?” “My breasts? Where did my breasts come from?” You repeat with wide eyes, absolutely awestruck and how much of a dumbass your brothers friend was. “Yes. Those,” he hisses, “You used to look like plank from Ed, Edd, and Eddy up until like two summers ago and then I come back and you’re packing two cantaloupes like it’s normal!” “It is normal! That’s literally how biology works!” You say, near hysterics, “You’re seriously blaming all of this on me?” “Yes! Because I was fine. I was fucking great—peachy fucking keen—and then you got hot and ruined my entire life. There I said it—are you happy?” He yanks at his hair like a man on the brink of insanity but that wasn’t right. Hoseok was way beyond the brink. “You….” your cheeks heat, “You think I’m hot?” “What do you have trash bags over all of your mirrors?” He asks incredulously, “Have you seen yourself? Yes I think you’re hot. I think that it’s only made about a thousand times worse by the fact that you’re my best friends little sister. You’re literally forbidden fruit and you know how well men do with that particular scenario. I’ve been set up to fail since Adam fucked Eve in the garden—““That’s not how that story goes,” you shake your head at him. “But you know what I mean.” Hoseok grips your shoulders tightly, “I kissed you and I fucked up and it’s not just because Namjoon will fillet my dick and serve it like sashimi with some soy sauce and wasabi.” “That’s really disgusting.” You inform, but Hoseok looks defeated. “I’m sorry. I’m really, really sorry. I’m sorry for kissing you and opening this can of worms and I’m sorry for being a dick about you having a crush on me all this time—“ “It was not a crush.“ “It was a full fledged crush. You know it was. It’s fine. You can’t help it. I am sexy, and funny and literally perfect and you couldn’t help your little seventeen year old heart. I understand—“ “I hate you so much.” You blink. “We all have our flaws and mine is that I’m literally anatomically perfect,” he says and you roll your eyes so hard it’s a wonder they don’t get stuck like that. Hoseok’s voice softens with a seriousness, when he says, “And I have the hots for my best friends little sister and I’m just figuring it out right now. This whole time I thought you couldn’t stand me and it was just sexual tension.” You squint at him in utter disbelief. “You were so close. So close to not being a dumbass for one second,” you explain, “Hoseok, I absolutely can’t stand you. You weren’t imagining that.” “No. I’m pretty sure you just want me to cum on your tits. I’m pretty good at guessing when a girl wants me to do that.” He says and you’re baffled. He was so dense. You punch him so hard he yelps but Hoseok wasn’t to be fooled. He’s done it enough times to know when he’s embarrassed you. “I’m not saying—“ you clear your throat, “I’m not saying that there’s no sexual tension I’m just saying that you’re obnoxious and a prick and amazingly enough that does nothing to dampen my need for you to—“ “Cum on your tits.” He says with such a look of understanding that you wonder if he’s serious. “Please stop saying that!” You groan. “Look, Hoseok. I just want to know where this leaves us. It was one thing when you were just teasing me about how I felt but now … now we’re both out there. We’re two consenting adults who want to have sex with each other and live in very close quarters.” “I think,” Hoseok sucks in a deep breath, “I think we both know what we have to do.” You nod in understanding and wait a beat. “We need to have sex.” “I need to move out.” You both freeze. “What?” Hoseok practically yells and you cover your ears. “Why are you yelling?” You hiss. “Because you’re out of your ever loving mind if you think I’m going to fuck you—what?” Hoseok’s eyes widen in disbelief, “How is that the solution to our problem?” Your cheeks flush with shame. “I don’t know! I just thought we’d fuck it out of our system—“ “That literally never works.” Hoseok says, “Ever. Don’t you watch TV? That makes things like infinitely harder every time! You’re supposed to be the smart one between the two of us!” “You don’t have to be so mean about it!” You say, “It was just a suggestion.” “Well it was a shit suggestion,” he seethes, “Your brother has known me for almost my entire life and he will take one look at me and know I had my cock shoved in one or several of your holes.” “Do you have to be so crass?” You throw your hands up. Hoseok lets out a deep sigh. “I think the best solution all around is for us to just give each other some space. I obviously can’t go looking for an apartment in the middle of the school year and Namjoon will be like suspicious so I have to worry about that too.” Hoseok pinches the bridge of his nose. “So that’s it?” You ask, “We just go back to how things were before?”“I mean, do you have a better idea?” Hoseok asks, brow furrowed in annoyance. “So you’ll be a hundred and ten percent okay with that?” You challenge. “I absolutely will. Nothing would make me happier than to go back to not talking to each other.” He sighs. “The best way for us to get over whatever this is is to do whatever we were doing before that. I’ll back to being the campus slut and you’ll go back to being the resident spinster.” Your posture stiffens, eyes narrowing at him. “Fine,” you say, “I’m so glad we had this discussion because now we don’t have to worry about our feelings getting in the way of other things right? Like our personal lives and what not.” “Sounds like a wet dream.” Hoseok returns. “Perfect.” “Great.” “Amazing.” You bark back, unsure of why you were glaring at each other but not backing down either way. You wait until he gets to the door to call out to him again, “Oh and as your roommate, I guess it’s common courtesy to tell you I’m expecting a guest over for the next week.” “I genuinely could not care less.” Hoseok blinks and you smile. And it wasn’t an entire lie—at least not at first. .Not until Jeon Jungkook had somehow finessed his way into your bedroom, on an air mattress, for an entire week. “Why do you care so much?” Namjoon asks around a pb&j sandwich. “I don’t care. I just think it’s weird you don’t care that one of your friends is sleeping in your sisters room for an entire week.” Hoseok scoffs, “Besides I didn't realize they were that close.” “They’re the same age, of course they’re closer than the rest of us. That’s like, her best friend.” Namjoon blink. “Since when?” Hoseok glares. “Since literally forever. Look, Hoseok, I appreciate the concern but my sisters a big girl. Besides, me interfering will only make things worse. In case you haven’t noticed, her favorite past time is doing the exact opposite of what I say. And it’s not like anything’s gonna happen—they’re just friends.” “Just friends, huh.” Hoseok presses his tongue against his cheek as he stares at the two of you on the couch. Jungkook has his arm around your shoulder and Hoseok has pictured at least six different ways to rip the limb from his body. “Fuck.” He groans. “I’m so fucked.”



Chapter 2
Chapter Notes
IM SO SORRY MY LAPTOP CRASHED ):



Hoseok’s beginning to realize a lot can happen in 10 years — people get together, they break up, or get married, start businesses, sometimes families. He himself was three for five. Lord knows he dated his fair share of women and alternatively been broken up with many a times before. He checked the start a business box somewhere around twenty seven and wouldn’t go on to succeed until thirty one with three failed businesses under his belt. And as for the getting married and starting a family, well— 
“I wanted broccoli not cauliflower.” Hyunae pouts. 
Hoseok blinks up at the five year old. “Aren’t they essentially the same thing?” 
“Broccoli is green. Cauliflower is white.” She explains, sounding more exasperated than Hoseok’s mother when he comes home for Christmas without a date … again. 
“Thank you for the lesson in colors, Picasso.” He rolls his eyes, “What five year old like vegetables anyway? Wouldn’t you rather have french fries?” 
“If I don’t eat vegetables I won’t grow up to be big and strong and if I don’t get big and strong then I won’t be able to beat you in air hockey.” She sighs, moving the vegetables around her plate with her fork. A smile tugs at Hoseok’s lips. 
“You’re right,” he nods, taking a seat next to her, “I guess we’ll have to practice after we eat then.” 
Hyunae lights up at the implication of his words and Hoseok thinks it might be worth letting her put fingerprints all over the floor to ceiling windows in his penthouse apartment. 
“You really mean it?” She screeches and Hoseok has to clap a hand over her mouth when everyone in the fancy restaurant turns to look at them. He lifts an apologetic hand at the servers when they glare at him. 
“Is there a reason you’re trying to smother my kid?” A voice drawls and when Hoseok turns around its only to scowl at his best friend. 
“Yes, because it was very hard to get a reservation at the most exclusive restaurant in the city—one that has a strict no kids policy, mind you—but luckily for you you have a best man with lots of connections.” 
“Well, no one asked the best man to book the most exclusive restaurant in the city—he did that on his own.” Namjoon reminds, crouching down to scoop his daughter into his arms. She was the spitting image of him, down to the dimples, though Hoseok would argue Hyunae was much cuter. 
“Namjoon, I know you don’t care about showing off to all of our hometown friends but I do.” Hoseok says, wrapping an arm around his shoulder, “This is my moment to shine—“ 
“This is my wedding. It is the exact opposite of your moment to shine.” Namjoon snorts and Hoseok groans. 
“Why are you always such a stick in the mud? You wouldn’t even let me throw your a bachelor party—“,
Namjoon claps his hands over his daughters ears and says, “Because your idea of a bachelor party is probably most people's idea of cheating.” 
“I read somewhere it’s bad luck to not sleep with a prostitute the night before your wedding.” Hoseok shrugs. 
Hyunae turns to look up at Namjoon, “Daddy what’s a prostitute? Why do you sleep with her?” 
He glares at his friend and Hoseok waves him off, “Don't worry I got this.” 
Namjoon watches as Hoseok crouches down to eye level with his daughter and tries not to fixate on the fact that the guys suit probably costs more than his rent and he’s just kneeling in it, on the dirty floor. 
“Hyunae, a prostitute is just a really nice lady you pay for a sleepover.” He says and before Namjoon can interrupt what is without a doubt going to be a mess he’ll have to fix, his daughters spouting off questions. 
“But what do they do at the sleepovers?” She asks curiously. 
“Sometimes they sleep, sometimes they—“ 
“Help fight off the monsters that live under the bed.” Namjoon interjects with a glare. 
“Really?” Her eyes widen in awe, “You said there’s no monsters that live under my bed though, daddy. You said you checked.” 
“Well—“ 
“That’s because daddy got a prostitute,” Hoseok explains and then grunts when his friend punches him in the gut. 
“You did?” She breathes. “That’s so cool!” 
“See?” Hoseok gasps, still hunched over in pain. “No harm, no foul.” 
“I want to be a prostitute when I grow up too!” She yells at the top of her lungs and Hoseok winces. Namjoon’s head drops back in defeat. “I’m gonna go tell Mommy!” 
“Hyunae, sweetheart—“ He begins but it’s too late. The kid sure as hell hadn’t gotten her speed and agility from Namjoon, not with the way she weaves her way through throngs of adults like an Olympic gold medalist. Hoseok just watches her go. 
“Mommy! Mommy! Daddy got a prostitute!” 
Namjoon turns to blink at his friend. 
“Well, that was unexpected, am I right?” Hoseok nudges him with a weak smile. 
“Your best man privileges are officially revoked.” He hisses. 
“Now, Namjoon, wait!” Hoseok whines, “You can’t do that! Who will you get to fill in for me?” 
“I saw a homeless guy on the way in. I’m pretty sure he’d do it for a pack of Marlboro gold.” Namjoon seethes. 
“Namjoon! Don’t be like that!” Hoseok groans, trailing after his friend pathetically. 
.
“I think I’m going to be sick,” you gripe, gripping Jungkook’s arm for further assistance. Your friend snorts before handing you the remainder of his water bottle. 
“I don’t know how that’s possible when you were popping tums like M&M’s for the last three hours.” He explains, grabbing your luggage so you can put your hair into a ponytail. You looked clammy and pale and were you not the biggest bitch on the planet while sick he might have felt bad for you. 
“You know I don’t travel well,” you huff, moving to collect the hotel keys off the counter—keys that took you an entire hour to get because for some reason Jungkook’s reservation was cancelled. 
The only thing you’d been looking forward to this entire trip was seeing your niece and getting a week long vacation away from work. Just you, your hotel room and the vibrator you packed and— 
“I’m so excited for our week long sleepover. It’ll be just like college.” Jungkook says cheerily and you stop walking. “Do you think it’s a little weird that Namjoon didn’t invite me to the party week? I mean, I know I have a tendency to overthink things but like I got my wedding invite but if it weren’t for you I wouldn’t have known about the party. You know what—never mind. It was probably chaotic and your brother is so absentminded sometimes he must’ve forgotten. I’m just going to sit back and enjoy the time we—“ 
He can’t see your eyes behind your designer sunglasses but he imagines you’re sending him your favorite bitch face. 
“Okay, see that,” you gesture to all of him, “Don’t do that.”
“Do what?” He asks. 
“Be happy,” you snap. 
Jungkook blinks at you. 
“So we’re not even gonna wait til we get to the actual party to be a cunt, we’re getting ahead of the festivities.” He snorts, brushing past you and you pout. 
Jungkook doesn’t hold the elevator for you and you walk straight into the door with a whine. 
“Ow, you bitch.” You seethe, rubbing your forehead. 
“It’s what you deserve,” he smiles. “I don’t understand why you get like this whenever you have to see—“ 
“Don’t.” You warn. 
“Hoseok,” Jungkook finishes, “Aren’t you two too old to be playing this game?” 
“We’re not playing any game.”  You inform. 
“The two of you freezing each other for the last ten years isn’t a game? Okay, Lebron, could’ve fooled me.” He snorts. 
“Don’t be a dick.” Your lip curls at him. 
“Don’t be a sorry bitch who can’t face her problems like a big girl.” He shrugs and both of you stop when you step out of the elevator because— 
“Holy fucking shit.” You breathe and holy fucking shit was right because this place was immaculate. Were it not for the giant sign at the front of the hotel you would’ve guessed you’d walked into the goddamn Buckingham palace. It wasn’t even a carpeted hallway like most hotels tended to have, the floors were literal marble. Every inch of the place was lined with gold and mirrored, and were your phone not on three percent, you would’ve snapped more than a few pictures for the gram. 
“How did your brother afford to rent out the entire floor of this place?” Jungkook asks incredulously. 
“He didn’t. Hoseok did.” A voice calls and when you and Jungkook look up a smile tugs at both your lips. 
“Hyung!” 
“Jimin!” 
You both squeal before nearly tackling the man to the ground and were he not five foot nine inches of solid muscle, you probably would’ve taken him down. But if there were something you learned about Jimin—what he lacked in height he more than made up for in muscle mass. 
“What are you doing here?!” You cry out, “I thought you were on duty! Joonie said you couldn’t make it!” 
“Technically, it ended a week ago,” he shrugs and when he smiles you spot that dimple that had done things to you between ages thirteen and fourteen. If you were being honest, it still did things to you. 
How terrible was it for you that all your brothers friends were ridiculously hot? You’d had a crush on nearly all his friends at one point in your life and Jimin was easily ranked in the top three for you. Number two even. Second only to— 
“Hoseok, was the one who came up with the idea to surprise him,” Jimin shrugs. “You guys are actually late. Everyone’s already had dinner I think. From what I hear we’re all meeting up at one of Hoseok’s clubs.” 
“We were late because someone printed the wrong itinerary and we missed our first flight,” you scowled at Jungkook. 
He rolls his eyes at you, “We made it didn’t we?” 
“Bitch, barely!” You exasperate. 
“See this is why I only see you twice a year because—“ 
“I wish I only saw you twice a year! You’re at my place so much there’s a permanent indent of your ass on my couch—“ 
Jimin waits for you to finish shouting at each other to speak and when he realizes it’s not going to be anywhere in the near future he sighs. 
“I see you two are still close.” He calls out over your yelling. “But we’re already late and if we want to be there before Taehyung starts dancing on tables we’ve got exactly one hour.” 
You and Jungkook stop arguing to glare at each other. 
“Shotgun shower first!” You both about at the same time and there’s no opportunity for Jimin to offer you his bathroom when the like of you are shoving each other down the hallway. 
“You bitch!” Jungkook seethes when you slam the door in his face. 
Jimin sighs, exasperated. 
.
“Namjoon, dude, come on,” Hoseok groans, “You’re being ridiculous.” 
“Hoseok, I wanted this to be an intimate affair—just friends and family.” Namjoon huffs his annoyance, moving to play with one of many KAWS toys his friend has on display. 
Hoseok doesn’t even blink when the guy breaks one by accident. 
Namjoon clears his throat, “I can pay for that.” 
“It was twenty five hundred dollars,” Hoseok explains and his jaw goes slack. 
“For a fucking toy?” He hisses. 
“It was a limited edition drop,” Hoseok shrugs, “But never mind that. How about instead of paying for some dumb figurine you go out there and have fun with your fiancé as payment?” 
“I haven’t even seen Lisa for an hour. This club is massive and it’s filled with people I haven’t seen in ten, fifteen years. I wanted something lowkey. You shutting your club down for the night and then filling it with a hundred people is the exact opposite of that!” Namjoon snaps. 
“Joonie,” Hoseok puts his hands on his friends shoulder, “What is really going on right now?” 
“I just told you.” He blinks. 
“You told me what you wanted me to hear, you didn’t tell me the real reason you’re wigging out over a party.” 
Namjoon holds the staring contest for a minute but Hoseok knows it’s a diversion—he’s been friends with the guy for too long to not notice his tells. There’s something else going on in that big, fat scientist brain of his and Hoseok wants to know what. 
Namjoon’s form deflates on a sigh, “Lisa’s pregnant again.” 
“What? Namjoon, that’s great!” Hoseok says, genuinely happy for his friend. He knows how much he loves Hyunae, even if she wasn’t planned and he always knew Namjoon wanted a big family, he just hadn’t expected the guy to choose right now to continue working on it. “It’s great isn’t it?” 
“No, it’s—it’s amazing. I’m so happy.” Namjoon says but his expression doesn’t match his words. 
Hoseok hesitates, “Then why do you look… you know… not happy about it?” 
Namjoon scrubs a hand down his face in frustration. 
“You’re gonna think I’m a terrible person when I say this,” Namjoon sighs. 
“Try me.” Hoseok scoffs. 
“I—I didn’t even tell Lisa this, I mean I can’t. I’m having a hard enough time saying it to you without feeling like the world's biggest piece of shit but…” 
“Will you stop worrying about what I think and spit it out?” Hoseok throws his hands up. 
“I thought we would have a little more time just the two of us.” He blurts out, “I mean, don’t get me wrong I love Hyunae and whoever this baby is I’m going to love them unconditionally and I feel so blessed to see our family growing but … but Hyunae—she's five now. She’s finally at an age where we’re getting back into the groove of our routine. And we thought, ‘okay maybe now we can do things right, we can get married’ and we planned this wedding and this honeymoon and now—now we have another baby on the way. Hoseok, I don’t know what the fuck I’m going to do.” 
“Namjoon—“ 
“We’re having another baby and I’m so fucking happy but I promised myself—I swore I would do this the right way the next time. We would plan and we would save and we would be prepared this time around. I mean, things were hard with Hyunae. We were happy but we weren’t ready for a kid … financially or mentally really. And we're back at square one, I just—“ 
“Why do you keep saying that?” Hoseok interrupts suddenly. 
Namjoon trips over his words, bewildered by his friends question. “I—what?” 
“‘The right way.’ You keep saying the right way—that’s twice now.” Hoseok explains, “You did do things the right way Namjoon. You found a beautiful girl you loved that loves you back and you made an even more beautiful child. You decided you wanted to spend the rest of your life with her and now you’re getting married and you come into my office and tell me you just found out you’re having another kid. Don’t you get it? You did everything the right way. Maybe not the conventional way but it’s not wrong, Namjoon.” 
Those words give him pause and leave it to his commitment-aphobe best friend to dish out advice that was doctor Phil worthy. Namjoon isn’t really sure why Hoseok was so opposed to relationships when he was damn sure the guy would one day make a lucky girl really happy. 
That is if he ever let his walls down long enough to let one in. 
Namjoon exhales deeply, “Thanks Hobi. I needed that.” 
“I know you did.” He sends him a small smile before clapping him on the back, “Now why don’t we—“
His words are cut short by someone (Taehyung) barreling into his office, looking more than a little drunk and a lot uncoordinated. “There you are! Hoseok, he’s here!” 
Namjoon’s brow furrows in confusion the same time Hoseok’s eyes widen. “Who’s here?” 
Taehyung smiles, “Ji—“ 
“Jin hyung,” Hoseok says, rushing to shove Taehyung out the door with a scowl. 
“But I already saw him.” Namjoon frowns, feet dragging when Hoseok puts his hands on his back to push. 
“Yeah, but you need to see him again,” Hoseok exasperates, doing his best to shove all six feet of him out the door. He spent too much goddamn time trying to rally all of their friends together and make this surprise happen for Taehyung to ruin it in five minutes. “We haven’t been together in years—you should do your best to make the most of our time together!” 
“Since when are you the sentimental type?” Namjoon snorts, “And will you stop pushing?” 
“I’ll stop pushing when you start walking!” Hoseok grunts, “God, I thought you said you went on a diet for your wedding. Have you always been this heavy?” 
“It’s muscle.” Namjoon says indignantly. 
“Muscle, my ass.” Hoseok snorts when he finally manages to get him to the first floor of the club. He has to yell over the music to be heard. “When was the last time you even looked at a weight rack?” 
Namjoon’s eyes narrow to slits but he sighs in defeat, “Was it when Jimin was here? You know how much of a bully he is when it comes to working out. In all honesty I’m surprised he hasn’t been promoted to drill Sargent by now, considering.” 
“Well if you had shown up to my graduation you would’ve known I got promoted to sergeant six months ago. But someone decided to get engaged.” A cocky voice calls and all three men freeze. 
Two of them braced for a reaction and the third… well he— 
“What the fuck are you doing here?” Namjoon cries out and Jimin barely has time to open his arms before all six foot one of his best friend is hurdling at him. 
“Surprise.” Jimin grunts.
“You said you couldn’t make it!” Namjoon breathes and much to everyone’s horror there’s tears in his eyes. “How are you—what are you? How are you here?!” 
“Well, your best man thought it would be a good idea to surprise you.” Jimin laughs, prying Namjoon’s death grip off of him. 
“Ex best man.” Hoseok corrects with a snort. 
Jimin cocks a brow, “Lovers spat?” 
Namjoon rolls his eyes, “He’s being dramatic. Don’t listen to him. What I want to know is when your duty ended?” 
“A week ago.” Jimin grins, “Hoseok’s been planning this for months though. He even flew me out and coordinated this entire thing. How he kept it a secret this long is beyond me.” 
The man in question shoves his hands in his pockets and if it weren’t for the dim lighting in the club, Namjoon was positive he would see a flush. Hoseok surprisingly, didn’t like attention when it came to things like this. Sentimental things. 
“Well, the trick was to not let Taehyung find out.” Hoseok snorts, “Though someone did spill the beans to him and he nearly ruined six months worth of hard work so…” 
Namjoon sighs deeply before taking a step towards his best friend. Hoseok cocks a brow at the man when he puts both hands on his shoulders and squeezes. “Thank you, Hobi. It means a lot to me.” 
“Yeah, yeah.” He rolls his eyes. “It was nothing.” 
“It’s not nothing,” Namjoon shakes his head, “Being back together with you guys is everything. You went above and beyond from the moment I told you I was going to ask Lisa to marry me. So thank you.” 
Hoseok looks away and clears his throat. “Yeah, well you’re not at the alter for another week so don’t thank met yet. You turned down the bachelor party, that doesn’t mean I don’t have a bunch of other morally questionable shit for you to do.” 
Namjoon’s lip lifts at the corner. “And I’ll be more than happy to participate because you gave me the best gift I could ask for. All of my best friends together in one place.” 
Hoseok grins at him. 
“Well,” Namjoon frowns, “almost all. I can’t believe Jungkook said he couldn’t make it. That’s so unlike him. Are you sure you told him that we were all getting together before the actual wedding?” 
Hoseok blinks. 
“Of course.” He lies. “I wouldn’t dream of leaving out—“ 
“What the fuck is up, bitches?” A voice bellows and Hoseok’s blood runs cold. 
He feels the twitch in his eye he’d work so hard to get rid of, come back. 
“Jungkook!” Taehyung cries before hurdling himself across the room and into his lovers arms. It’s a wonder the two of them didn’t live together, considering every time they saw each other they acted like the time apart was a form of torture. “I thought you weren’t going to make it! Hoseok said you were off the grid doing … whatever it is you do to make money.” 
“Why do you guys make my job sound so intrepid? I make movies.” Jungkook pouts. 
“You make porn,” Hoseok mutters under his breath, “And not the good kind.” 
“I knew you’ve seen my work! Which was it—Brazzers, Bellesa? Did I tell you I’m free lance now?” Jungkook jabs a finger at him and then breaks into a huge grin, “How’s my favorite hyung?” 
Hoseok levels the younger boy with a lethal stare. Jungkook makes it exactly three steps in his direction.
“Don’t touch me unless you’re fully prepared to lose that arm.” Hoseok says calmly. 
“Fine. Play hard to get,” Jungkook buffs before turning to face Namjoon, “And tfti to the bachelors week.” 
“Bachelors week?” Namjoon’s brow furrows. 
“Yeah—you know. Your bachelors week. The week long celebration you’re hosting? The reason all of us here seven days before the actual ceremony?” Jungkook rolls his eyes. 
“First of all it is not an entire week. It’s not even a night. I told Hoseok no,” Namjoon levels his best friend with a glare. 
“Technically you said no to a bachelor's party. You never said no to several parties over the course of a week.” Hoseok shrugs. 
“Hoseok.” Namjoon growls and the man winces. 
“Namjoon, you’re the first one of us to get married you can’t tell me you didn’t expect this to be a week long booze fest. We’re mourning the end of an era—“ 
Namjoon visibly seethes at that and Hoseok rushes to tack on, “And the beginning of your new life! Joonie, you said no strippers, no prostitutes, no recreational drugs and I agreed. You can’t take this away from me. You know how much I love throwing parties! I even compromised and made it coed! Lisa and her hot bridesmaids will be there every debauched step of the way.” 
“I know you’re trying to make me feel better but you’re making it entirely worse.” Namjoon sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose. When he opens his eyes again, Hoseok is sending him with a pleading look, “But … fine. You’re right. This is as good a time as ever to party, isn’t it?” 
“Yes!” Hoseok pumps a fist in the air, “You won’t regret this, Joon.” 
“I better not.” Namjoon scowls. 
“Sorry to interrupt this beautiful moment, but I still want to know what happened to my invitation.” Jungkook piped in and Jimin actually laughs. 
“Hoseok was in charge of all the festivities,” Namjoon sighs, “He told me he sent you an invite.” 
Everyone turns to look at the man in question.
“Hmm?” Hoseok asks, “Oh. Yeah. I did send it. Must’ve gotten lost in the mail…. or my trash can. You know how forgetful I am.” 
“Oh come on,” Jungkook sighs, “Don’t you think it’s time to let sleeping dogs lie?” 
Hoseok stares at him for a long time, expression looking rather bored. 
“Go fuck yourself.” Hoseok says point blank before wandering off in the opposite direction. 
“Alright! I’ll catch up with you later!” Jungkook calls loudly, “I love you, Jung Hoseok! Don’t you ever forget that!” 
Hoseok doesn’t even turn around when he flicks the younger boy and it makes Jungkook sigh with fondness. He truly did miss his friends. 
“Well, I think that went well,” Jungkook puts his hands on his hips and turns to face his remaining friends. “Don’t you think?” 
“We have two very different definitions of well,” Jimin snorts, before throwing back the scotch Namjoon handed him. 
“You know you guys rarely see each other but it feels like when you do, you devote all of your time to antagonizing him.” Namjoon rolls his eyes. 
“Our relationship is misunderstood.” Jungkook shrugs. “It’s complicated, if you will.” 
“Then let me simplify for it you,” Jimin snorts, before patting his friend sympathetically, “Hoseok hates you and you get your rocks off giving him shit. You do it every time we manage to get together. Don’t think you have any of us fooled even for a second.” 
Jungkook grins wide, “I do enjoy giving him shit.” 
“Why does Hoseok hate you anyway? I feel like one second you guys were tight like buttholes and the next you were feuding.” Taehyung frowns. 
Jungkook shrugs, “It beats me. He started being a dick to me and somewhere along the way I realized he wasn’t joking. So I give it back to him in a way that absolutely drives him insane.” 
“Showering him with love and affection?” Jimin cocks a brow. 
Jungkook winks at his friend before stealing the rest of his drink.
“Jung Hoseok hates any type of emotion that isn’t ‘horny.’ I mean, I once saw the guy get doused in champagne because some girl he had been fucking asked him what he looked for in a relationship,” Jungkook informs, shoving his hands in his pockets. 
All three men look at him curiously. 
“And?” Taehyung asks finally. 
“He said a way out,” Jungkook snorts. 
Namjoon rolls his eyes—he’s disappointed but not like, surprised. Hoseok was exactly what you imagine a millionaire, bachelor who owned a string of night clubs would be like. He liked pussy and he liked money and somewhere in there he pencilled in loyalty and family, so Namjoon couldn’t fault him for all of that. Hoseok wasn’t a bad person, he just made … really dumb decisions. 
“Speaking of a way out,” Jimin clears his throat, “Shouldn’t one of you chase after him before he dips  out on us?” 
“Nah, he won’t leave. I saw Yoongi hyung stop him at the bar.” Taehyung shakes his head. “You know what that means.” 
Jimin snorts because he does know what it means. Yoongi hated social events as much as he hated high school and he’d hated it … a lot. Now those two things together? Make for a happy Yoongi they do not. Still, even the rather aloof, and always missing in action friend in their group, carved out time because Namjoon was getting married. He was the first of their friends to do it and it was a momentous occasion—even the worlds biggest introvert couldn’t turn him away. That being said, if Yoongi had to be subjected to this shit show, he was gonna make sure everyone else had to suffer with them. 
Especially the person who coordinated it. 
.
“Drink.” He demands, voice like gravel from being otherwise mute tonight. Yoongi refused to talk to any of these people. He hated them ten years ago and he sure as fuck hated them now. 
“Do you have to look so angry about it?” Hoseok whines. 
“You’re not drunk. I need you to be drunk so I can kill you and drag your lifeless body to the river.” Yoongi looks down at his watch, “It’s already midnight and I’d like to be in bed by three.” 
“Yoongi, come on. It is not that bad.” Hoseok whines but the older boy grabs him by the back of the head and tips him back—placing the glass at his lips like a bottle. 
“Shh, shh. They were go, let’s get you nice and drunk.” He murmurs and Hoseok chokes on the vodka going down, righting himself abruptly before anymore of it could get on his suit. 
Hoseok glares as he wipes the spit and liquor from his lips. “Why don’t you try socializing?” 
“I was socializing before you told me to stop.” Yoongi shrugs, flagging a bartender for another drink. 
“No, I told you to stop telling Ann Hanks that you and I were gay and having anal sex every night right before performing pagan rituals and sacrificing virgins.” Hoseok seethes. 
“Ann Hanks shouldn’t have told homosexuality is a sin. Why is she even here? We hated her in high school because she was a giant bitch.” Yoongi blinks. 
“Exactly Yoongi. We hated her. And now she has to see how well all of us are doing.” Hoseok claps him on the shoulders. 
“Doesn’t that excite you?” Hoseok sighs. 
“No, Hoseok that excites you. You looked a second away from cumming your pants when you were telling the guy who used to shove Jungkook into the lockers that he’s an international film maker now.” Yoongi scoffs, and Hoseok’s face darkens at the reminder of the younger boy. “Oh. I’m sorry. Are you still pretending to hate him?” 
“I’m not pretending. I do hate Jungkook. He’s a little prick and besides I didn’t lie! Jungkook technically is an international film maker!” 
“Shooting amateur, voyeur sex outside of the louvre is hardly film making. But it is international so I’ll give you that.” Yoongi snorts before thanking the bartender and taking a sip of his beer. “Look all I’m saying is you’re acting like my mom—“
“Yeah well she’s an amazing woman and if you’re ever looking for a step dad…” Hoseok shrugs. 
Yoongi blinks at him, “You’re deflecting.” 
“I’m doing no such thing.” 
“My mom does this thing where she talks shit to my face and tells me how much of a disappointment I am and that I need to settle down and do better blah blah blah. But when she’s around her friends or our family all she does is brag about my long list of accomplishments. I resented her for a long time because of it and if you keep playing this game, Jungkook’s gonna end up resenting you.” Yoongi returns. 
“Good. He should. Because I can’t stand him.” Hoseok snaps. 
“That’s a lie and you know it. You probably still haven’t told him the reason your panties are in a knot is because he—“ 
“Would you look at the ass on that girl?” Hoseok whistles and Yoongi rolls his eyes. 
“Real mature, Hoseok.” 
“I’m being serious. I mean, look we have our entire lifetime to have these deep soul searching conversations but Yoongi, that ass? I’ve only got a week.” Hoseok sighs, “God, I love weddings.” 
“Who even—?” Yoongi huffs, following Hoseok’s line of vision. And boy was he right. Said ass was prettily packaged in a dress so tight, all of her internal organs were probably made visible. However… 
“You can’t wear panties in a dress like that, Yoongi.” Hoseok sighs dreamily. 
“But that’s—“ Yoongi cuts himself off mid thought because this was exactly what the doctor ordered. Hoseok had tricked Yoongi into coming out tonight, saying they were gonna go bowling. Hoseok had invited all of their high school classmates. And Hoseok was now holding him hostage. 
It’s what he deserves. 
“You know what, you’re right.” Yoongi nods, “You should go get her before someone swoops in and gets to her first.” 
“Probably Taehyung,” Hoseok snorts, “The guys been battling me for pussy all night. No way I’m letting him get in the way of this.” 
“Go get ‘em, tiger.” Yoongi shoves him off in the opposite direction. 
Blissfully ignorant of the lions den Yoongi’s just sent him in to, Hoseok turns around and sends his friend a mega watt smile. 
“You  fool.” Yoongi sighs before he sits back and watches the show. 
.
“You look gorgeous.” Lisa breathes and you positively beam at her. Your brother, for as long as you’ve known him had shitty taste in women—you’d spent most of your life being terrified he’d marry or worst, knock up a psycho. But by the gift of God, Lisa had come into both your lives and saved you from a fate of murdering one of his girlfriends. An inevitability you’d come to accept long ago. 
She was as sweet as they came, and so sincere and pretty and smart. If anyone asked you’d say she was out of Joonie’s league because quite frankly, Lisa was perfect. The perfect mother, perfect sister in law and soon to be perfect wife to an idiot. But you didn’t care, you would thank your lucky stars and cherish her until she forgot that your brother was an ape. 
“Thanks. It took both me and Jungkook to get me into this dress.” You snort. 
“And is it gonna take both you and Jungkook to get you out of that dress?” She winks. 
“Gross. Don’t start.” You gag. “Not you too, Lisa. I thought we were friends! I thought you knew better!” 
“I’m just teasing.” She snickers, “I know how insane it drives you that people think you’re a thing.” 
“Because we’re not. He’s my best friend.” You roll your eyes. “Besides I’m at a point in my life where I can barely tolerate men much less date them.” 
“Well, that being said—is it safe to say you didn’t use the plus one we gave you?” She asks. 
“Sure is. I can’t imagine bringing anyone around my brother and his psychotic friends. Without fail, everytime I bring someone home they scare him off and that sad part is it’s not even intentional. They’re just fucking weirdos!” You groan. 
“You know, Joonie and your dad are starting to worry. It’s been a couple years since you’ve introduced them to anyone.” She hums. “I know you and your brother don’t always see eye to eye but you’ve got to know he wants what’s best for you. You’re all he talks about these days. He feels like you’re pulling away from him ever since you accepted that job offer in the city.” 
“Lisa, I love you,” you squeeze her shoulders, “and I love you for worrying about me and Namjoon’s relationship but … me and him … we’re just different. We always have been and always will be. But I don’t want to think about that now. I want you and him to enjoy your wedding. I want everything to be perfect for you two because you’re some of the most important people in my life.” 
Lisa sighs, but nods. 
“Can I say one last thing and I promise to drop it?” She asks, grabbing your hands in hers. 
“Sure,” you smile. 
“He feels guilty.” She says softly and your smile slips, “All those years. He told me you used to hero worship him and he pushed you away and he won’t ever tell you any of this himself because he thinks it’s a just punishment. You not wanting anything to do with him is what he deserves—or so he says—and I’ve told him over and over again that you’re not like that. That you want a brother as much as he wants he wants his baby sister back but he won’t budge.” 
“Lisa, I haven’t been Namjoon’s baby sister in a long time….” you say with an apologetic smile. 
“You’re wrong. You never stopped being his baby sister,” she shakes her head, “At the end of the day it’s your life and I don’t know everything that went down between you and him, and I know this is selfish of me but I think … I think the best wedding present you could give Namjoon and i is to give him the opportunity to fix what’s broken between the two of you.”
You sigh deeply but squeeze her hands. 
“He’s so lucky to have someone like you,” you say honestly, “Is there any chance I can steal you away from myself?” 
“We should wait at least three years to start our torrid affair,” she giggles. “But that’s enough of all that mushy stuff. You’re not drinking anything, let me go grab you something.” 
“No, you’re fine. I can—“ 
“I insist.” Lisa presses and before you can stop her she’s getting lost in the crowd. 
You turn around with a sigh, and wonder not for the first time how your brother managed to land Lisa. You’re so caught up in your thoughts, you underestimate the distance between you and the high table that held your purse—knocking everything clean off. 
“My dress is way too tight for this shit.” You groan and then curse because these shoes were killing you. Loubotins looked amazing, but they were hell on your arch. 
You knew your feet would be bleeding by the end of the night. One way or another. 
“Excuse me,” a low voice calls and it takes you a minute to get back up—only when you do, you run your ass right into someone. “Sorry. I hope this isn’t too forward but I saw you and I was hoping to—“ 
You turn around with a frown. “Hoseok?” 
He doesn’t mean to scream. He really doesn’t. But it does happen and it’s loud. 
“What the fuck are you doing here?!” He cries. 
You blink at him. 
“At my brother's wedding?” You ask, staring at him like he’s an idiot—because he was. He is. 
“What the fuck are you wearing?” He hisses. 
You recognized that outrage anywhere. Hoseok had the same tone that day all those years ago. When he was an unsuspecting victim to his attraction for you. You weren’t stupid—you knew Hoseok hated the fact that he wanted you about as much as you hated the fact that you wanted him. At the end of the day, the two of you were like oil and water and had only grown further and further apart as the years progressed. There was just too much history between the two of you to ignore—most of which Hoseok had spent tormenting you. 
You think a little torment over your own is long overdue. 
“Jung Hoseok,” you smirk, when you catch his eyes dipping lower than your face. But it wasn’t his fault damnit—you all but had your tits out on display for him. (For any man really, but Hoseok was choosing to ignore that little fact) “were you coming over here to hit on me?” 
“You think…?” Hoseok eyes widen, “that I—I’m sorry what? Me? Hit on you? Psh.” 
“You’re blushing.” You point out and you squint your eyes at him, moving in closer. So close that Hoseok stops breathing for a minute when you back him against the bar rail. In heels, you were taller than him and Hoseok didn’t like that. It gave you way too much power over him. He shivers when he feels one of your hands caress the shell of his ear, “Your ears are hot.” 
Hoseok scowls at you, extracting himself from your ridiculously long limbs. “Have you heard of personal space?” 
“Here and there,” you shrug, moving closer to him just to watch the way his cheeks heat. “So tell me, are you still an ass man or have I converted you for life?” 
He wants to tell you you’ve got both so he’s impartial, but he’d no sooner saw off his own arm than admit he wanted to fuck you.
You’d changed a lot since he’s last seen you. Not just physically—though you seemed to get more and more beautiful everyday—but personality wise. If there was one thing Hoseok’s learned over the years it’s that a woman at peace with her sexuality was a dangerous thing. You seemed more than at peace with it. It almost felt like you wielded it like a weapon. And it wasn’t just the dress or the shoes or those massive breasts of yours that Hoseok wants bury his— 
He shakes his head at the thought. 
The point was you were grown and all he had to was take one look at you to know he was royally fucked. 
It was fine though. He was fine. He would just ignore you—like he has been for the last ten years. 
“You always been this cocky?” He nods and you lean back against the bar—the action pushes your breasts out further and you send him a naughty grin. 
“I learned a thing or two from a guy or two,” you shrug, “or ten.” 
Hoseok scoffs, appalled. And he wishes he could say he was appalled because he thought of you as a little sister and not because he wants fuck you in every available surface in his penthouse aparatment. 
“Your brother know you talk like that?” He asks.
“Did you know that everytime I turn you on you bring up my brother?” You ask, moving to crowd his space. Again. “You did it ten years ago and you’re doing it now.” 
Hoseok’s entire body stiffens and the sight brings joy to your heart. You’d been the mouse for too long, it was about time you got to be the cat. And something about this Hoseok, whether it was because of his age or just slowing down in general, told you it’d been a long time since he’d played in general.
But you were still new to casual sex and taking what you wanted—you were still hungry and dying to sate something you couldn’t quite put your finger on. 
One thing you did know is it began and ended with Jung Hoseok. Fucking him was non negotiable. It was the end to a chapter you’ve desperately wanted to close for the last ten years and whether or not he knew it, this was happening. 
“You do not turn me on,” he sighs before moving to get away from you, “Look. I’m sorry for being weird, I thought you were someone else. But please help yourself to food, the top shelf liquors reserved for family and your names on the list for the bartenders—“ 
“We’re not family.” You say abruptly. 
Hoseok blinks at you. “... Okay? Whatever,I just meant—“
You take another step closer and Hoseok was getting real tired of not being tired of you invading his personal space. 
“Sorry. I needed to clarify that for future reference.” You inform and Hoseok hisses when you back him against the bar rail. 
It’s much to his horror that your body is softer than it looks. He knows this because you’re all but melded to him. 
“F-Future reference?” He chokes out. 
“For when we finally have sex.” You explain. 
“Excuse me?” He hates that his voice cracks. He hates that in this moment he felt like some fourteen years old who’s about to get his first taste of pussy. Hoseok puts his hands on your hips to push you away but he can’t. He physically can’t. Not when he looks the way you feel when he squeezes you, not when he wonders if you would bruise easy and not when he’s hoping you do so he can stare at the marks everytime he fucked you. “We are not having sex. We are having the opposite of sex.” 
“I’m sorry, I’m having a hard time taking you seriously when your hands on my ass.” You remark dryly and much to his dismay it is. 
How the hell did that get there? How long had he been kneading it unconsciously?
Either way Hoseok wrenches his hands away from you but you won’t give up that easily. 
You lean closer until your lips brush his ear, “I’m going to fuck you, Jung Hoseok and when I’m done with you, you won’t know what to do with yourself.” 
He sucks in a breath, eyes screwing shut when he feels your teeth graze the shell of his ear. “You think awfully highly of yourself don’t you?” 
“I’ve learned a lot of new tricks and I want to try them all out on you,” you inform, hands carding through his hair and making him shiver, “I’m going to make you regret ever fucking with me.” 
“If the goal is to punish, having sex with me isn’t exactly going to accomplish that.” He murmurs, but his eyes are glazed over. 
“It is the way I do it.” You smile and it’s so .. evil. 
God, you were hot. 
“I’m going to make sure you hate me the same way I’ve hated you all these years. Because every girl you fuck after me will leave you wanting. Because they won’t be as tight as me or as wet as me. They won’t let you do whatever you want to them, or say all the nasty shit you love to hear.” You smooth the hair from his face and the loving action is in direct contrast with your words. “And after this week, you’ll never get another taste.” 
Hoseok grabs your hands in his, holding them gently. His voice is soft when he speaks to you, “Just because I want to have sex with you doesn’t mean I will. You wanna play this game with me you’re gonna regret it.” 
“Oh, baby,” you coo patronizingly, smoothing a hand down his face. “Sex with me is not a matter of if, but when. I’m not the same twenty year old girl who let you taunt and tease her. I learned how to play, Hoseok and you’re at the top of my list of guys to fuck over.” 
He nods thoughtfully and when he looks back at you, there’s a glint in his eye that hurdles you all the way back to that three bedroom apartment in college. 
“Maybe so,” he sighs before letting his hand coast you your curves, if only to watch the way your eyes darken with desire. “But I’m a veteran. I might be out of practice—but I didn’t forget.” 
You scowl when he pushes you away. 
“I don’t know what makes you think a little girl like you could seduce me, but you’re barking up the wrong tree. I’ll let it go this time. I’ll give you a pass. Chalk it up to drunken shit talking and never bring it up again.” He shrugs. 
“Oh, Hoseok,” you sigh, “you don’t understand. I’m not gonna seduce you. I’m going to destroy you.” 
You don’t even let him get another word in, just brush past him and sashay that’s ass of yours, probably to ruin some other mans life. Hoseok isn’t sure when it happened. But all he did is blink and little ___ he grew up with his a certified man eater and despite his earlier words, he wasn’t entirely confident he would make it out of this alive. 
“You could at least try to hide your erection.” A voice notes dryly and when Hoseok looks up his eyes narrow to slits. 
“You knew didn’t you?” He seethes. 
“Why I don’t know what you mean,” Yoongi says innocently. 
“You knew that was ___ and you still let me walk up to her.” Hoseok accuses and Yoongi doesn’t bother to hide his shit eating grin. 
“You deserve it.” Yoongi pats him on the shoulder, “You do know she’s going to eat you alive, don’t you?” 
“She won’t.” Hoseok returns, but he does so as he adjusts the tent in his pants so it holds no real value. 
“Hobi, let me tell you something about ___, since you’ve been away for too long,” Yoongi sighs, “When that girl sets her sights on something, she gets it. No if and or buts. I don’t know whether to congratulate you or offer you sympathy for the fact that she her sights set on your dick.” 
Hoseok groans miserably. “I’m not going to fuck her.” 
“But you want to.” Yoongi says. 
Hoseok sends him a look. 
“More than I want to take my next breath.”
