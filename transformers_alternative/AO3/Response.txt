Summary
Most people were pretty accepting when popular pro-hero Deku went public about his relationship with retired hero All Might, but he should have known someone was going to try to start drama. Luckily, click-bait news sources aren't the only ones good at making headlines.
Notes
Took me a little longer than I intended, but I wrote this, let's say... inspired by some negativity last week, so, tbh, it's kind of a vent-fic.

Response

They'd been dating for a good while, but they'd only been out for a few weeks when Izuku encountered his first seriously unpleasant reporter.

It wasn't the first time a reporter had been rude to him, but usually they were just criticizing his work as a hero, or nitpicking something he said, looking for some little detail to pounce on and make a story out of. It usually wasn't vicious, and it certainly had never been that personal.

And he was aware there had been some angry murmuring on the internet over the past few weeks, from people who apparently had nothing better to do with their time than complain about celebrities’ relationships. (He couldn't help thinking some of them were jealous.)

So he shouldn't have been all that surprised or bothered when a middle-aged woman with a dangerous smirk approached him after a routine rescue one day, a man with an expensive consumer-class video camera following after her.

“Deku!” she called, beckoning him over. When he was within range, she introduced herself. “Tanaka Kimiko, with Hero Station. That was an impressive rescue just now. Do you mind answering a few questions for us?”

From what Izuku remembered, Hero Station was a pretty popular internet channel that did a lot of click-bait gossip pieces. They always had a lot of views, but they were still just an internet channel, not comparable to an actual news station. Even so, he’d never turned down an interview before and had no intention of doing so now, so he said, “Sure”, and gave her a heroic grin.

She made a hand motion of some sort at her cameraman, then struck a standard sort of interviewer pose. “It’s been quite a busy month for you, hasn’t it?” she asked, not conversationally, but in such a way that Izuku knew she was going somewhere with it, as interviewers always did.

“Just about as busy as always,” he said cheerfully. “Work’s been pretty steady since I debuted.”

Tanaka hummed. “But hero work isn’t all you’re doing these days, is it?” Izuku considered offering some minor detail about his personal hobbies (people tended to like that kind of thing), but she didn’t give him any time. “Your relationship with All Might must be taking up quite a lot of your time too.”

“Oh.” Izuku knew he should have expected that. He wouldn’t have gotten that sort of question from most of the official networks (the more liberal ones had mostly been polite enough to leave him alone about it; the more conservative ones wouldn’t touch it with a ten-foot pole; really, either was fine with him), but internet shows were known for their brazenness. They had no funding to lose for pissing off hero associations, after all. He wasn’t sure he was comfortable talking about it just yet, but he wasn’t going to side-step the issue either, especially as it sounded like she was accusing him of getting distracted. “We do spend a lot of time together, sure, but I’ve never had a hard time balancing my relationship and my job.”

Weirdly, Tanaka didn’t seem remotely interested in his response. Where most interviewers were sneaky enough to at least try to work your responses into their intended topic, Tanaka just forged right ahead as if Izuku hadn’t said anything at all. “Now, does it make you feel guilty at all?”

“What?” Izuku raised an eyebrow, his smile faltering somewhat. Guilty? He didn’t think he had anything to feel guilty about. As he’d said, his relationship didn’t hinder his abilities as a hero. If anything, it was the opposite.

“You don’t think it’s sort of immoral, as a hero, to be so open about something like this?” Tanaka crossed her arms and cocked her head to the side, like she was considering something a bit unsavory. “Even though you know kids are going to be looking up to you? What if your young fans start thinking it’s okay, start emulating your behavior? Are you going to hold yourself responsible for their abuse?”

“I don’t--...” Izuku frowned. As much as he liked to avoid that kind of expression in public, he couldn’t help it. He was perplexed, and a little bit disturbed at the words she was throwing around. “I, I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

Tanaka gave him a patronizing look. “So you aren’t bothered, dating someone easily old enough to be your father? It’s a bit distasteful. Don’t you think it’s your job as a hero to encourage more healthy behaviors?”

Despite himself, Izuku could feel his jaw trembling as he tried to keep a straight face in light of these accusations. This woman was a little out of line here, but… was this really what people thought? “That’s not--...” He paused, unsure what to say. How did you respond to something like this? How did you even start? “...Nothing about my relationship is unhealthy.”

“So you don't mind,” Tanaka said, really not a question because none of these were questions, really. “The fact that All Might was already an adult when you were just a little child. You don’t think that’s a bad message to be sending to kids, that it’s okay to let older men take advantage of you? Just because they’re famous? Did All Might use his connections to get you this job? Is that how he pays you off?”

Izuku grimaced. “No,” he told her, as forcefully as he could manage but more quietly than he'd intended, finding it hard to speak. He took half a step back, away from her predatory gaze. She closed the distance.

“So you’re just in it for the shock value,” she said, frowning thoughtfully. “The publicity? No press is bad press, right?”

“I, I’m not trying to get publicity.” He held his breath, almost afraid to breathe. He took another step back and glanced around, hoping someone might come rescue him from this situation. Absurd, he knew. He was a hero; he shouldn’t need help from someone else. He should be able to handle this woman and her vaguely villainous interrogating. Still, he couldn’t help hoping a civilian would run up and ask him for his autograph.

Tanaka wasn’t done making baseless accusations. “Unless he coerced you? Blackmailed you?” she guessed. She had a look on her face like she was playing at sympathy, layered over top a fierce judgment. Her voice rose in volume, projecting for their prospective viewers. “You’re the hot new thing and he’s old news. He couldn’t get someone his own age and had to go after a child?”

Izuku’s jaw dropped at the implication. “He’s--, I’m not--”

“But you were just-- how old? Sixteen? Fifteen? When you first met.” Her eyebrows drew down in an exaggerated concern. “Your idol, the strongest man in the world; you must have felt powerless to reject him. Would you have respected him so much if you knew before that? That he was a predator?”

His eyes went wide. He was really shaking now, some combination of outrage and genuine fear. He couldn’t speak, frozen to the spot as this woman bore down on him with vicious insults against a man who had never done anyone any wrong and wasn’t even there to defend himself. Izuku should have spoken up in All Might’s defense, told her to back off, but somehow she’d paralyzed him, hit that strange spot that rendered him defenseless. He felt like a child, scared of this well-manicured woman in exactly the way he had never ever been of his hero.

“It's pretty presumptuous, isn't it, to call yourselves heroes when you're advocating such a harmful lifestyle?”

Izuku was spared having to come up with an answer to what was probably a rhetorical question when there was a noise like an explosion in the distance. He startled nearly out of his skin and everyone glanced in the direction of the sound. His heart was pounding, but it kicked his brain back into gear. He pulled up a smile, wavering and fake beyond belief but effective enough for the moment. “Gotta go!” he said, waving briefly to the camera before he ran off, glad his legs stayed steady until he was several blocks away.

When his heart started to calm down and his anxiety stopped telling him that Tanaka might be following after him, he stumbled to a stop on the rooftop of an office building. Taking a deep breath, Izuku sat down heavily and pulled his phone out. | Explosion at the south end of 2nd Street |, he sent, and waited for someone in the group chat to reply | got it handled! | before he clicked his phone off and laid back on the hot concrete of the roof.

He blinked up at the bright blue sky, watching birds and planes for a few minutes while he breathed.

What had just happened? He felt more drained from that short exchange than he'd ever felt from an entire afternoon of pulling people from burning buildings. Tanaka’s words, they'd really gotten to him, despite knowing she was just trying to get a rise out of him. That was what she'd been doing, right? Just saying exactly what she thought would get him to react? But it was cruel, too cruel, and too crude, and he should have had a better response than freezing up like a bunny caught in a fox’s den.

He sighed and picked up his phone again. Before he knew it, he'd pulled up Toshinori’s contact. Some little voice in the back of his head kept worrying: is he okay? Is he okay? What if that woman went after him? It didn't make sense and he knew it, so he resisted the instinct to call, even if he felt desperate to hear for himself that the reporter hadn't somehow gotten to him in the past fifteen minutes, as if that was remotely likely. Instead Izuku texted him, a simple | hey |.

Toshinori responded almost immediately, and Izuku could hear the warmth in his voice even through the text. | Hey. What's going on? I'm finishing some papers but I'll be heading home in a while. |

| Just wanted to say hi |, Izuku responded. After a moment he added, | I love you. See you at home. |

There were a few moments in which Izuku closed his eyes and tried to clear his mind of the low-key chaos, and then Toshinori replied, | Love you too. See you there. |

Izuku smiled to himself, soft and small. Toshinori’s words pushed the worry back a bit, and a little further when Izuku thought of his smile, and his arms wrapped around him. Yeah, he was lucky.

The sun was nice on his face now that he'd gotten his brain to calm down a little, so he laid there another few minutes. But as he was sitting up on his elbows, his phone buzzed. It was a text from Kirishima, separate from the group text most of the old class was part of.

| U ok Midoriya? That hero station interview was brutal |

A shiver ran down Izuku’s spine, sickly and hot. | I just got away from her fifteen minutes ago |, he sent back. | I haven't seen it |

| yeah they work fast |, Kirishima replied, along with a link to the video, which had already been posted for a whole five minutes. Gritting his teeth, Izuku clicked the link and watched the uncomfortable three-minute long thing. They'd titled it “The truth behind Deku’s illicit affair”. Izuku didn't know what they were trying to imply by ‘illicit’ but it sure sounded like the type of ugly buzzword he expected to see. Luckily they hadn't doctored the content at all, but if they were trying to make him look bad they didn't have to; he looked about as opposite of a hero as it was possible to while still in costume, clearly out of his depth, his trademark smile faded after the first few moments of Tanaka’s interrogation.

He turned it off and put his head in his hand, careful not to crush his phone in the other. God. His brain was just flatlining, trying to make sense of this situation. He couldn't understand what the motive was, for taunting him like that. That was how grade-school bullies acted, not adults, not professionals.

Another text came in a moment later, this time from Ochaco. | omg deku, are you alright? |

He was in the middle of replying that he was fine when the group chat exploded.

| did you guys see that hero station interview? Tanaka just tore Midoriya to shreds! |

| https://herostation.vidz.jp/heroes/vtijdsehkv |

| yeah I saw it. Jeezus. |

| omg wtf? That's pretty fucking uncalled for |

 | Rude. Hero Station is seriously trashy. |

| Stay out of hte comments section. It’s already chaos down there, assholes comin out of the woodworks. | 

Izuku groaned. He could imagine what kinds of things people were saying; he’d spent plenty of time on forums as a kid, so the depth of the internet’s nastiness was not unfamiliar to him, as much as he tried to avoid it.

| Should we tell him? | 

| I’ve seen it |, he replied with slightly shaky hands, just before Kirishima added, | i already told im | 

| Are you okay?? | 

| omg are you ok | 

| Someone needs to go slam-dunk Tanaka. | 

| you looked like a fucking deer in headlights | 

| Geez, sorry you had to deal with that shit. Wish I coulda been there to help. | 

| do we need to do sum damage control? | 

| I’ll fight that bitch | 

| Midoriya, where are you? Can we help? | 

A tremulous smile worked its way up onto Izuku’s face and he closed his eyes against the swell of emotion. He laughed, though he wasn’t sure quite why. | Guys, I’m fine. But thanks. | 

| Oh thank goodness | 

| you had us worried! | 

| Don’t worry |, he told them. | I’m going home now. |

Instead of waiting around to see their responses, Izuku locked his phone and put it back in his pocket, then made his way back home to the apartment he shared with Toshinori, keeping to rooftops. He didn’t feel like seeing people, so he climbed in through the balcony instead of taking the stairs. Realistically, he knew it wasn’t likely that his neighbors would have seen that video yet, if they ever saw it at all, but just the idea of having to face down anyone who’d watched it made him feel a little ill.

Toshinori wasn’t home yet when he got in, so the place was dark and quiet. Izuku opened some windows and let the calm atmosphere of home sink into him for a few minutes before he gave in and checked the group chat again, the persistent buzzing pulling him out of his private reverie.

His former classmates had gotten quite a discussion going in the several minutes it took him to get home. From where he left off, they’d continued with their worries and sympathy. Then someone had suggested that they could go after Hero Station for libel. ( | Slander |, someone had corrected. | But defamation either way. | ) The discussion had gone forward on that topic for a while, before it was dropped when someone brought up the video’s comments section again.

| some people are calling Tanaka out on her bullshit, but a lot of people are wondering if she’s telling the truth | 

| What truth? She just threw a bunch of insults at him. Most of it didn’t even make sense. | 

| about him using all mights connections and stuff, like that all might bribed him or whatever | 

| God thats so fucking stupid | 

| Anyone who thinks that has clearly never seen them together. | 

| or the way Midoriya pined after him all through highschool lol | 

| Yeah but now the big topic is ‘Is All Might Fuckable?’ Some asshole says he’d never wanna fuck all might so like that’s apparently proof that Deku was bribed | 

| omg are they blind??? | 

| and now that’s what everyone’s talking about. It’s getting pretty ugly tbh | 

| How quickly the masses forget. | 

To be honest, Izuku wasn’t surprised. There’d been a little bit of that going around back when All Might’s true form was first revealed to the public. People on the internet who couldn’t be bothered to keep their unpleasant opinions to themselves had made it clear that they didn’t like this change, like it was some sort of new accessory that could be criticized and not literally a person’s whole self-image. There were polls all over the popular websites asking if people still liked All Might, still would want to meet him, still found him attractive. And while the grand majority of people still had an overall positive opinion of him, every person in the world who now found the hero unattractive had seemed to materialize from the ether to let people know about it. They were considered a vocal minority (because maybe a lot of people didn’t exactly think he was sexy anymore, but most reasonable folks at least kept quiet about it), but they certainly were vocal. Izuku had watched Toshinori struggle not to let the bombardment of negativity affect him, and it was painful not to be able to comfort him, to explicitly assure him that not everybody felt that way; it had been too early, and they’d only just barely hinted at any of the feelings they might have had for each other.

He didn’t want to have to go through that again. Even though now he could do everything he hadn’t been able to do before, to shower Toshinori in affection and love, he wished desperately that it wouldn’t be necessary as a way to combat cruelty being spewed by faceless internet trolls. Toshinori deserved so much more than that.

Izuku sat down on the couch and pulled his legs up under him. He watched the conversation as his friends alternately fretted over the two of them and considered showing up as a small mob outside of whatever served as Hero Station’s offices. He laughed when they tossed around the idea of forming a human shield around him whenever he went out next. They all knew it was silly, but the imagery was a good tension-breaker at least.

It was ten or fifteen minutes later when he heard the door click. He sat his phone down next to him and looked up as Toshinori wandered slowly in, eyes trained on his own phone. His brow was furrowed and he looked more like the run-down mess he often had back in the day than the healthy, groomed version of himself he was these days, even with the tailored suit. His mouth was pressed into a thin line as he read.

“Hey,” Izuku said quietly, fairly certain he knew what Toshi was reading.

Toshinori blinked and looked up and his expression fell loose. He dropped his bag where he was and stuffed his phone into his pocket, then walked deliberately over to Izuku’s side. Frowning softly, he reached down for Izuku’s hand and held it tightly in his own. “When did this happen?” he asked.

“A little while ago.” Izuku stood up and rearranged himself into Toshinori’s space, needing to be close. “... Did you see it?” He sighed. “I didn't know what to say, how to respond.”

“I know,” Toshinori said, understanding. He lowered his chin into Izuku’s hair. “It's never easy, dealing with those kind of people. But you did fine.” He hugged him close, then closer. “Are you alright?”

“...I dunno,” Izuku answered honestly. He'd have never worried his friends with an answer like that, but he could be open with Toshinori, and he knew the man would understand. “I mean, I'm fine, but…”

Toshinori nuzzled into his hair in response. He got it.

“It's just, I don't want people thinking things like that about us. About you. Just because I couldn't… think of the right words to defend myself. I don't wanna bring more drama down on you, or make you regret going public.”

Surprising a breath out of him, Toshinori pulled them both down onto the couch, where he could make better use of Izuku’s size and hold him in his lap, wrap his long arms around him. “I don't regret going public with you. That won't change, no matter what hurtful things people say on the internet or in newspapers. It's just talk. It doesn't mean anything.”

Izuku closed his eyes and sighed against Toshinori’s chest. “It's just not fair, to you. You know, after everything you've done.”

“The world's never been fair,” Toshinori said. He reached up and threaded his fingers into Izuku’s hair, scratching lightly. “We both know that. But we get what we need anyway.” Gently, he tilted Izuku’s head up so he could look him in the eye. “I have what I need. So it doesn't matter what everyone else says.”

Well, Izuku understood that at least. He straightened up and kissed Toshinori, bringing a smile to both their faces. He left his face pressed up against Toshinori’s for a minute, enjoying how soft his skin felt on his cheek, the creases of his smile lines.

The little tendrils of doubt reached back into his mind though, because Tanaka’s words just wouldn't entirely fade. “But you know… I really love you for you, right?” he asked, needing to make it crystal clear that nothing that woman said had had any bearing in truth. “Not because of your connections, or your status, or, or because I was too young to tell you no, or any of the stupid things people think?”

“I know.”

“And I know you could get pretty much anyone else,” Izuku added, remembering the debate that was apparently happening about All Might’s attractiveness.

Toshinori laughed and shook his head. “That's not important to me,” he said, sliding down so he was laying out on the couch with Izuku mostly on top of him. It was quiet for a few moments while they laid there, and then he added, “and that's an exaggeration anyway.”

Izuku raised his head from where it was resting on Toshinori’s chest and grinned at him. “No it's not. You only think that because people don't tell you you're hot to your face. They just tell me instead!”

“No,” Toshinori said in denial, and Izuku could see a faint blush on top of his bashful smile.

“Yes.” Izuku laughed, shoving at Toshi playfully. “You know how many people have told me how jealous they are? A lot.”

It was definitely true, and he wished he'd known it before, back when he didn't have a better way of comforting him. (Although he realized telling the man that most of his schoolmates had crushes on him wouldn't have necessarily achieved any desired effect at the time, so it was probably okay that he didn't start finding out about it until a while later.)

They went back and forth for a while, with Toshinori denying that people could still be interested in him (aside from Izuku of course, but that was different), and Izuku assuring him that yes people were, and providing generic enough examples that he would get the point without feeling awkward next time he saw the person, like telling him that someone had a thing about his lovely, long fingers without mentioning that that person was Jirou Kyouka, or only saying that someone had once wistfully appreciated Toshinori’s supposedly sexy and mysterious air but not saying that it was a slightly-drunk Sero Hanta. As it was starting to get late and they were starting to get hungry, they took the conversation into the kitchen while they had dinner, letting themselves wind from one silly story to another, happy to keep it light-hearted. They both ignored their phones for the rest of the evening, even though they continued to buzz with notifications of people likely trying to get their attention.

When they went to bed, Izuku took the opportunity to prove that he still loved Toshinori most, no matter what his friends or fans or critics thought, no matter if Toshinori believed that any of those stories were true. He used all the methods he couldn’t use the first time, and repeated the process until he was satisfied that his hero knew. Toshinori did much the same, apparently eager to show that he wasn’t worried about the things that were said in internet videos or forums, as long as he could be right there with Izuku.

It was morning when they finally looked at their phones again. Izuku knew he couldn’t put it off much longer. The group chat had gone on long into the night, and there was no way he was going to have the time or patience to catch up, so he didn’t bother, instead only skimming the most recent entries. That was all he needed to find that while they had slept, apparently the internet had blown up.

“Goodness,” Toshi said from beside him, looking down at his own phone with a somewhat disbelieving expression, the hint of an amused smile on the edges of his mouth.

Izuku didn’t have to see what was on his screen; he had a feeling he knew what someone had sent him.

In the approximate twelve hours while they’d been ignoring social media, there had been a community-wide conversation that had gone somewhat like this: first, the initial response to Hero Station’s video. A lot of people were making fun of Deku’s obvious fright, and a lot of people were entertaining the idea that Tanaka had been right about the ‘unhealthy’ nature of their relationship. That was where the vocal minority came in, adamant about their own disinterest in All Might and how that was proof enough that Deku couldn’t really honestly love him, that their relationship was a sham.

There'd been some honest discussion then, with facts and observations, about his and All Might’s relationship and how it might actually be and whether or not it mattered because they were definitely both adults now and could do whatever they wanted in that regard, and if that meant lying for whatever reason (and Izuku still didn’t get why anyone would think that), then so be it.

That hadn't lasted long though; the media preferred the simpler conversation about All Might and brought it back around to focus on that. That was when things got interesting.

Apparently annoyed that the media wouldn't leave it alone and kept stirring the pot, his friends and fellow heroes had decided to just give the media exactly what they wanted: opinions.

He was currently staring at a headline that genuinely seemed like a joke: “Slews of heroes come out to say that they would definitely have sex with All Might, if given the chance.” Izuku curled into a ball and hid his face in his pillow, unable to stifle a slightly hysterical laugh.

“Well,” he heard Toshinori say from outside his pillow-helmet. “This is… illuminating.”

Izuku peeked out at Toshi. “I told you,” he said.

He stayed curled up there for a few minutes, mentally shaking his head at his friends’ antics, before he decided to finally click the article.

“In light of a recent video by Hero Station’s Tanaka Kimiko, which raised questions about the nature of the relationship between popular pro-hero Deku and former number-one hero All Might, many heroes from across the country, and even some from the further reaches of the globe, have claimed that they too would have happily pursued a relationship with the former hero. In response to accusations that Deku was bribed, more than seventy heroes have posted on their personal blogs or social media channels their opinion on the ridiculousness of the idea, citing their own personal preferences. 

“ “I’d f*** All Might,” hero Ground Zero tweeted. “Anyone who says they wouldn’t is f***ing lying.” 

“While Ground Zero’s tweet was among the most explicit, it was a sentiment that was echoed multiple times in the hours that followed. Some cited more specific reasoning, but the consensus was that, among the pro-hero population, there were few who hadn’t fantasized about the former hero at some point or another. 

“Still others of Deku’s graduating class came forward with assurances that the popular young hero had maintained an interest in All Might long before the two ‘finally’ became a couple, which, according to multiple sources, was perhaps years before they went public, shattering the idea that either hero is in it only for the publicity.” 

There was more to the article, but Izuku didn’t bother reading it. His eyes had gotten a little too misty to continue focusing on the words, touched that his friends would defend them like this. He laughed, imagining Kacchan typing out that tweet, probably coming close to damaging his phone in the process.

“I’m not going to be able to look anyone in the eye anymore,” Toshinori said, eyes closed, an embarrassed grin on his face as he turned towards Izuku and burrowed back down into the covers.

Izuku mirrored his expression, huddling closer to him until their foreheads touched. “Sorry,” he said, laughing and pressing their noses together. “I hope that doesn’t include me though.”

Toshinori opened his eyes, so close they were impossible to properly focus on, but still their usual beautiful blue. “I tried that once,” he said softly. “It didn’t work out.”

“That’s okay.” Izuku kissed him soundly, and pulled the blanket up over their heads. His phone continued to buzz on the nightstand, but he cheerfully ignored it. His friends had done a great job with the response so far; he figured he’d let them keep at it for now, discussing how lucky he was that his teenage dreams had come true. It was early enough still, and Toshinori was there with him in their nice warm bed; he had time for a couple more dreams.
