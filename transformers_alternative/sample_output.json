Even back when ritual chanting was a normal thing on this continent, it was mostly for adults. Yet there they go, Sammy and her latest pack of idiot friends, wearing silly outfits and chanting in a graveyard. They started at midnight, which was silly, the best time to start is a little past eleven, because then by midnight you've got a good rhythm going.\nBut Sammy had never once taken up with sensible cultists. No, it was always idiot children just smart enough to hit on something that works, and plenty stupid enough to dive headfirst into the worst kinds of trouble.\n\"Stop, Sammy,\" said one, and he'd heard it more times than he really needed, but not that many, and it felt great when he'd gotten back to his home.\nIt was the one time after nightfall that he would see more and more cultists everywhere, the ones who'd been in the forest that evening with Sammy. It was still early morning, no doubt, and many kids who'd just moved back into their house wouldn't be able to find it, because all of their neighbours were too busy playing cards, trying their best to make it to this particular graveyard. The other children who were sitting at the table, the two sitting in the corner, the one who was sitting in the middle of the graveyard.\n\"What does this sound like?\" said a little white girl, looking up from one of the pictures Sammy was reading at the top of the newspaper. A woman in a white blouse stood over a small kid holding up a paper bag she carried on her lap and leaned in close. As soon as she looked that close, Sammy's eyes shot open for what felt like three or four seconds and his head shot up a little at the sound of her words.\n\"It's what I think,\" she said slowly, her voice shaking.\nSammy's head shuddered for a couple more seconds.\nHe started to walk by her, making his way through the trees that hung over the tree line. But when he'd reached the most important side of the graveyard, there was a dark blue flash, and his eyelids fluttered as his cheeks started to droop. He didn't take his eyes off the picture, and he looked up at the blonde girl and she blinked a couple of times. \"You're alive!\" she said, not quite looking up at"

No, it was always idiot children just smart enough to hit on something that works, and plenty stupid enough to dive headfirst into the worst kinds of trouble.\nAnd yet, those who did have a lot of practice, especially with their kids, tended to start all over again, like in this village, even though they had only just returned. They stopped and checked their pulse. If you see them with their kids at the same moment, they have that same kind of attitude to things.\nThey could, or might be, going off on their stupid ideas that only a few were in danger, that are so far beyond their understanding, or they'll do a lot to find out which of their friends is in the danger zone and make a quick fix.\nIt was hard to even get any real work done with an army. Only because it was the biggest, dumbest, most stupid village in the whole entire north of the continent. It was probably one of the most dangerous towns that the world had ever come across. The villages of Europe were also dangerous.\nThey would just make the village mad, which was when you had to turn down that call, or so the boys told themselves, at least at the risk of losing what they thought was their own.\nAnd if Sammy was crazy, he would always have the kids ask him if he would kill them. As stupid as that was.\nAnd if your kids knew the people who would try and get you mad, you would just have to go and find out.\nMaybe. Maybe not.\nIf there was anyone in Europe who cared about that, their only concern would be to do the wrong thing, though, to just throw them out.\nBut they were always going to have to do the same as their kids. They had to be smart enough to see through stupid bullshit or find what worked, so they would watch and watch.\nAnd the way to do things, though, was simple.\nTry"

No, it was always idiot children just smart enough to hit on something that works, and plenty stupid enough to dive headfirst into the worst kinds of trouble.\nAnd in an average family, that meant the child would have a tendency to talk about his or her family all night long. They would go to the kids' house and show them a bunch of children's books or a bunch of children's films or old movies about ghosts before their kids are ready to put them on the airwaves. So you would hear more kids churping about a kid they just met at a pub or on the phone than the kids on the road. But sometimes they would only talk about the kid who was out and about.\nSo the kids would always go with her as sometimes as once as, in an attempt to get some sense of who these kids were or where they came from.\nThat's what a cult works on. We didn't have a lot of control over the kids, no matter how much we messed around. My grandfather always told me that he used to work for two dozen cultists.\nAnd then the next kids would pick out one of them\u2026\n\"I saw the big bang coming. The whole world went to hell. Like I was a bomb in my head. You can't put a value on this shit. I saw the world falling away like a giant steel ball. And I saw the whole world falling away like a giant steel ball of my own.\"\nAnd then I'd go do some research\u2026\nand find out that his grandfather was actually a cult master.\u00a0 I never had a clue. I know the cult is on steroids. The cult is on shit, but the fuck do you care if they're just going nuts or even if they're doing some pretty terrible things on purpose.\nSo what do I do?\nWhen I started living in America, I wasn't interested in religious ideas, not at all.
