BEFORE THE CURTAIN

Most of the PUNCH artists of note have used their pencils on the
theatre; with theatricals public and private none has done more than Du
Maurier. All have made merry over the extravagances of melodrama and
"problem" plays; the vanity and the mistakes of actors, actresses and
dramatists; and the blunderings of the average playgoer.

MR. PUNCH genially satirises the aristocratic amateurs who, some few
years ago, made frantic rushes into the profession, and for a while
enjoyed more kudos as actors than they had obtained as titled members
of the upper circle, and the exaggerated social status that for the time
accrued to the professional actor as a consequence of this invasion.

The things he has written about the stage, quite apart from all
reviewing of plays, would more than fill a book of itself; and he has
slyly and laughingly satirised players, playwrights and public with an
equal impartiality.

He has got a deal of fun out of the French dramas and the affected
pleasure taken in them by audiences that did not understand the
language. He has got even more fun out of the dramatists whose "original
plays" were largely translated from the French, and to whom Paris was,
and to some extent is still, literally and figuratively "a playground."

MR. PUNCH AT THE PLAY

SOMETHING FOR THE MONEY

(_From the Playgoers' Conversation Book. Coming Edition._)

[Illustration]

I have only paid three guineas and a half for this stall, but it is
certainly stuffed with the very best hair.

The people in the ten-and-sixpenny gallery seem fairly pleased with
their dado.

I did not know the call-boy was at Eton.

The expenses of this house must be enormous, if they always play _Box
and Cox_ with a rasher of real Canadian bacon.

How nice to know that the musicians, though out of sight under the
stage, are in evening dress on velvet cushions!

Whoever is the author of this comedy, he has not written up with spirit
to that delightful Louis the Fifteenth linen cupboard.

I cannot catch a word "Macbeth" is saying, but I can see at a glance
that his kilt would be extremely cheap at seventy pounds.

I am not surprised to hear that the "Tartar's lips" for the cauldron
alone add nightly something like fifty-five-and-sixpence to the
expenses.

Do not bother me about the situation when I am looking at the quality of
the velvet pile.

Since the introduction of the _live_ hedgehog into domestic drama
obliged the management to raise the second-tier private boxes to forty
guineas, the Duchess has gone into the slips with an order.

They had, perhaps, better take away the champagne-bottle and the
diamond-studded whistle from the prompter.

Ha! here comes the chorus of villagers, provided with real silk
pocket-handkerchiefs.

It is all this sort of thing that elevates the drama, and makes me so
contented to part with a ten-pound note for an evening's amusement.

       *       *       *       *       *

[Illustration: _Pantomime Child (to admiring friend)._ "Yus, and there's
another hadvantage in bein' a hactress. You get yer fortygraphs took for

THE HEIGHT OF LITERARY NECESSITY.--"Spouting" Shakspeare.

       *       *       *       *       *

WHEN are parsons bound in honour not to abuse theatres?

When they take orders.

       *       *       *       *       *

WHAT VOTE THE MANAGER OF A THEATRE ALWAYS HAS.--The "casting" vote.

       *       *       *       *       *

"STAND NOT ON THE ORDER OF YOUR GOING."--An amiable manager says the
orders which he issues for the pit and gallery are what in his opinion
constitute "the lower orders."

       *       *       *       *       *

GREAT THEATRICAL EFFECT.--During a performance of _Macbeth_ at the
Haymarket, the thunder was so natural that it turned sour a pint of beer
in the prompter's-box.

       *       *       *       *       *

[Illustration: THE DRAMA.--"'Ere, I say, 'Liza, we've seen this 'ere
play before!" "No, we ain't." [_Wordy argument follows._] "Why, don't
you remember, same time as Bill took us to the 'Pig an' Whistle,' an' we
'ad stewed eels for supper?" "Oh lor! Yes, that takes me back to it!"]

       *       *       *       *       *

_Mrs. Parvenu._ "I don't know that I'm exackly _gone_ on Shakspeare
Plays."

    [_Mr. P. agrees._

_Actor._ "No. I play _Hamlet_!"]

       *       *       *       *       *

TO ACTORS WHO ARE NOT WORTH A THOUGHT.--We notice that there is a book
called "Acting and Thinking." This is to distinguish it, we imagine,
from the generality of acting, in which there is mostly no thinking?

       *       *       *       *       *

A CRUSHER.--_Country Manager (to Mr. Agrippa Snap, the great London
critic, who has come down to see the production of a piece on trial)._
And what do you think, sir, of our theatre and our players?

_Agrippa Snap (loftily)._ Well, frankly, Mr. Flatson, your green-room's
better than your company.

       *       *       *       *       *

[Illustration: The higher walk of the drama]

[Illustration: "Auntie, can _you_ do that?"]

       *       *       *       *       *

Theatrical managers are so often accused of being unable to break with
tradition, that it seems only fair to point out that several of them
have recently produced plays, in which the character of "Hamlet" does
not appear at all.

       *       *       *       *       *

ON A DRAMATIC AUTHOR

  "Yes, he's a plagiarist," from Tom this fell,
    "As to his social faults, sir, one excuses 'em;
  'Cos he's good natured, takes a joke so well."
    "True," cries an author, "he takes mine and uses 'em."

       *       *       *       *       *

THE MANAGER'S COMPLAINT

  She danced among the unfinished ways
    That merge into the Strand,
  A maid whom none could fail to praise,
    And very few withstand.

  A sylph, accepted for the run,
    Not at a weekly wage;
  Fair as a star when only one
    Is shining on the stage.

  She met a lord, and all men know
    How soon she'd done with me;
  Now she is in _Debrett_, oh, and,
    That's where they all would be!

       *       *       *       *       *

[Illustration: A FIRST NIGHT.--_Indignant Playwright (to leading actor,
behind the scenes)._ "Confound it, man, you've absolutely murdered the
piece!" _Leading Actor._ "Pardon me, but I think the foul play is
yours!"]

       *       *       *       *       *

_Smart._ How do, Smooth? (_to theatrical manager, who frowns upon him_).
What's the matter, eh?

_Smooth._ Matter? Hang it, Smart, you wrote me down in "The Stinger."

_Smart (repressing something Shakspearian about "writing down" which
occurs to him, continues pleasantly)._ Wrote you down? No, I said the
piece was a bad one, because I thought it was; a very bad one.

_Smooth._ Bad! (_Sarcastically._) You were the only man who said so.

_Smart (very pleasantly)._ My dear fellow, _I was the only man who saw
it._ Good-bye.

    [_Exeunt severally._

       *       *       *       *       *

MOTTO FOR A BOX-OFFICE KEEPER.--"So much for booking 'em."

       *       *       *       *       *

"A considerable demonstration of approval greeted the fall of the
curtain." How are we to take this?

       *       *       *       *       *

[Illustration: "THE DESIRE OF THE MOTH FOR THE STAR."--_Mistress._ "And
you dare to tell me, Belinda, that you have actually answered a
_theatrical advertisement_? How _could_ you be such a _wicked_ girl?"
_Belinda (whimpering)._ "Well, mum,--_other_ young lidies--gow on
the--stige--why shouldn't _I_ gow?"]

       *       *       *       *       *

[Illustration: THE COUNTER-CHECK QUARRELSOME.--_Mr. Æsopus Delasparre._
"I will ask you to favour me, madam, by refraining from laughing at me
on the stage during my third act." _Miss Jones (sweetly)._ "Oh, but I
assure you you're mistaken, Mr. Delasparre; I never laugh at you on the
stage--I wait till I get home!"]

Theatre, Mrs. Vere-Jones was gowned simply in a _clinging_ black velvet,

DRAMATIC NOTES OF THE FUTURE

     [A little cheild is the hero of _Everybody's Secret_; the curtain
     rises upon four little cheildren in _Her Own Way_; there are
     cheildren of various ages in _Alice-Sit-by-the-fire_.]

Mr. Barrie's new play, _The Admirable Crèche_, will be presented
to-morrow. We understand that there is a pretty scene in the third act
in which several grown-ups are discovered smoking cigars. It may
confidently be predicted that all the world will rush to the "Duke of
York's" to see this novelty. _The Admirable Crèche_ will be preceded at
8.30 by _Bassinette--A Plea for a Numerous Family_, a one-act play by
Theodore Roosevelt and Louis N. Parker.

Little Baby Wilkins is making quite a name with her wonderful rendering
of "Perdita" in the Haymarket version of _A Winter's Tale_. As soon as
actor-manager Wilkins realised the necessity of cutting the last two
acts (in which "Perdita" is grown up) the play was bound to succeed. By
the way, Mr. E. H. Cooper's new book, "Perditas I have Known," is
announced.

Frankly, we are disappointed in Mr. Pinero's new play, _Little Arthur_,
produced at Wyndham's last week. It treated of the old old theme--the
love of the hero for his nurse. To be quite plain, this stale triangle,
mother--son--nurse, is beginning to bore us. Are there no other themes
in every-day life which Mr. Pinero might take? Could he not, for
instance, give us an analysis of the mind of a young genius torn between
the necessity for teething and the desire to edit a great daily? Duty
calls him both ways: his duty to himself and his duty to the public.
Imagine a Wilkins in such a scene!

The popular editor of the "Nursery," whose unrivalled knowledge of
children causes him to be referred to everywhere as our greatest
playwright, is a little at sea in his latest play, _Rattles_. In the
first act he rashly introduces (though by this time he should know his
own limitations) two grown-ups at lunch--Mr. Jones the father, and Dr.
Brown, who discuss Johnny's cough. Now we would point out to Mr. Crouper
that men of their age would be unlikely to have milk for lunch; and
that they would not say "Yeth, pleath"--unless of Hebraic origin, and
Mr. Crouper does not say so anywhere. Mr. Crouper must try and see
something of grown-ups before he writes a play of this kind again.

We regret to announce that Cecil Tomkins, _doyen_ of actor-managers, is
down again with mumps.

THEATRICAL.--When it is announced that an actor will be supported by the

BY DEPUTY

  As Shakspeare could not write his plays
    (If Mrs. Gallup's not mistaken),
  I think how wise in many ways
    He was to have them done by Bacon;
  They might have mouldered on the shelf,
    Mere minor dramas (and he knew it!)
  If he had written them himself
    Instead of letting Bacon do it.

  And if it's true, as Brown and Smith
    In many learned tomes have stated,
  That Homer was an idle myth,
    He ought to be congratulated;
  Since, thus evading birth, he rose
    For men to worship from a distance:
  He might have penned inferior prose
    Had he achieved a real existence.

  To him and Shakspeare some agree
    In making very nice allusions,
  But no one thinks of praising me,
    For I composed my own effusions:
  As others wrote their works divine,
    And they immortal thus to day are,
  If someone else had written mine
    I might have been as great as they are!

Numerous applications were received by the manager of Covent Garden from
"professionals" wishing to take part in _The Forty Thieves_. It was not
found possible to offer engagements to the following (amongst others):--

_The Thief_--who stole a march.

_The Thief_--in the candle.

_The Thief_--who was set to catch a thief.

_The Thief_--who stole the "purse" and found it "trash."

_The Thief_--who stole up-stairs.

_The Thief_--of time, _alias_ procrastination, and--

_The Thief_--who stole a kiss (overwhelming number of applicants).

A MODERN REHEARSAL

_Leading Lady (to Stage Manager)._ Who's that man in the ulster coat
talking to the call-boy?

_Stage Manager._ Don't know, I'm sure. Perhaps a gas-fitter. Now, as I
was saying, Miss Frisette, I think that all your alterations in the
dialogue are quite up to date, but we must give Splitter a chance for
his cackle. Ah! here he is.

_Splitter._ Well, old boy, I've worked in that scene to rights, but the
boss thinks that some allusions to Turkey served up with German sausage
would fetch 'em. So you might chuck it in for me.

_Stage Man._ Of course I will. Capital idea. (_Marks prompt-book._) I
wonder who that chap is in the wing?

_Splitter._ Haven't the faintest idea. Looks like an undertaker. Hallo,
Wobbler, brought your new song?

_Wobbler._ Yes, it ought to go. And I've a gross or so of capital
wheezes.

_Splitter._ No poaching, old chap.

_Wobbler._ Of course not. I'll not let them off when you're on. Morning,
Miss Skid. Perfect, I suppose?

_Miss Skid (brightly)._ I'm always "perfect." But--(_seriously_)--I had
to cut all the idiotic stuff in my part, and get Peter Quip of "The
Kangaroo" to put in something up to date. Here's the boss!

    [_Enter Mr. Footlyte, the manager, amid a chorus of salutations._

_Stage Man._ Places, ladies and gentlemen.

_Mr. Footlyte._ Before we begin the rehearsal, I would point out that I
have completely rewritten the second act, and----

_The Stranger in the Ulster._ But, sir, I beg of you to remember----

_Mr. F._ Who is that man?

_Everybody._ We don't know!

_Mr. F. (advancing)._ Who are you, sir, who dare to trespass on my
premises?

_The S. in the U._ Don't you remember me, Mr. Footlyte?

_Mr. F._ No, sir, I do not. What's your business?

_The S. in the U. (nervously)._ I am the author of the piece.

_Everybody._ Ha! ha! ha!

_Mr. F._ Then you're not wanted here. (_To stage manager._) Jenkins,
clear the stage.

MEANT AS A COMPLIMENT.--_Shakspeare Smith (to Miss Lagushe, after
production of his new comedy)._ And what did you think of my little
piece the other night?

thought was, what a cruel ordeal the performance must be for _you_!

NEO-DRAMATIC NURSERY RHYME

HINTS TO AMATEUR PLAYWRIGHTS.

_Of the Essence of Drama._--It is not strictly necessary that you should
know much about this, but as a rough indication it may be stated that
whenever two or more persons stand (or sit) upon a platform and talk,
and other persons, whether from motives of ennui, or charity, or malice,
or for copyright purposes only, go and listen to them, the law says it
is a stage-play. It does not follow that anybody else will.

_Of the Divers Sorts of Dramatic Writing._--Owing to the competition
nowadays of the variety entertainment you will do well to treat these as
practically amalgamated. For example, start Act I. with an entirely
farcical and impossible marriage, consequent upon a mistake similar to
that of "Mr. Pickwick" about the exact locality of his room; drop into
poetry and pathos in Act II. (waltz-music "off" throughout will show
that it _is_ poetry and pathos); introduce for the first time in Act
III. a melodramatic villain, who endeavours to elope with the heroine
(already married, as above, and preternaturally conscious of it), and
wind-up Act IV. with a skirt dance and a general display of high
spirits, with which the audience, seeing that the conclusion is at hand,
will probably sympathise. Another mixture, very popular with serious
people, may be manufactured by raising the curtain to a hymn tune upon a
number of obviously early Christians, and, after thus edifying your
audience, cheering them up again with glimpses of attractive young
ladies dressed (to a moderate extent) as pagans, and continually in fits
of laughter. The performance of this kind of composition is usually
accompanied by earthquakes, thunder and lightning; but the stage
carpenter will attend to these.

_Of Humour._--Much may be accomplished in this line by giving your
characters names that are easily punned upon. Do not forget, however,
that even higher flights of wit than you can attain by this means will
be surpassed by the simple expedient of withdrawing a chair from behind
a gentleman about to sit down upon it. And this only requires a
stage-direction.

_Of Dialogue._--Speeches of more than half a page, though useful for
clearing up obscurities, are generally deficient in the qualities of
repartee. After exclaiming, "Oh, I am slain!" or words to that effect,
no character should be given a soliloquy taking more than five minutes
in recitation.

_Of the Censorship._--This need not be feared unless you are unduly
serious. Lady Godiva, for instance, will be all right for a ball where
the dress is left to the fancy, but you must not envelop her in
problems.

WHY I DON'T WRITE PLAYS

(_From the Common-place Book of a Novelist_)

Because it is so much pleasanter to read one's work than to hear it on
the stage.

Because publishers are far more amiable to deal with than
actor-managers.

Because "behind the scenes" is such a disappointing place--except in
novels.

Because why waste three weeks on writing a play, when it takes only
three years to compose a novel?

Because critics who send articles to magazines inviting one to
contribute to the stage, have no right to dictate to us.

Because a fairly successful novel means five hundred pounds, and a
fairly successful play yields as many thousands--why be influenced by
mercenary motives?

Because all novelists hire their pens in advance for years, and have no
time left for outside labour.

And last, and (perhaps) not least, Why don't I send in a play? Because I
_have_ tried to write _one_, and find I can't quite manage it!

THE MOAN OF A THEATRE-MANAGER

  Who gets, by hook or crook, from me
  Admittance free, though well knows he
  That myriads turned away will be?
                      The Deadhead.

  Who, while he for his programme pays
  The smallest silver coin, inveighs
  Against such fraud with eyes ablaze?
                      The Deadhead.

  Who to his neighbour spins harangues,
  On how he views with grievous pangs
  The dust that on our hangings hangs?
                      The Deadhead.

  Who, in a voice which rings afar,
  Declares, while standing at the bar,
  Our drinks most deleterious are?
                      The Deadhead.

  Who, aye withholds the claps and cheers
  That others give? Who jeers and sneers
  At all he sees and all he hears?
                      The Deadhead.

  Who loudly, as the drama's plot
  Unfolds, declares the tale a lot
  Of balderdash and tommy-rot?
                      The Deadhead.

  Who dubs the actors boorish hinds?
  Who fault with all the scenery finds?
  Who with disgust his molars grinds?
                      The Deadhead.

  Who spreads dissatisfaction wide
  'Mongst those who else with all they spied
  Had been extremely satisfied?
                      The Deadhead.

  Who runs us down for many a day,
  And keeps no end of folks away
  That else would for admittance pay?
                      The Deadhead.

  Who keeps his reputation still,
  For recompensing good with ill
  With more than pandemonium's skill?
                      The Deadhead.

  Who makes the bankrupt's doleful doom
  In all its blackness o'er me loom?
  Who'll bring my grey head to the tomb?
                      The Deadhead.

LESSONS LEARNED AT A PANTOMIME

(_By an Intelligent Schoolboy_)

That demons are much given to making bad puns, and have on their
visiting lists the most beautiful of the fairies.

That the attendants upon the demons (presumably their victims) spend
much of their time in break-downs.

That the chief amusement in Fairyland is to stand upon one toe for a
distressingly long time.

That the fairies, when they speak, don't seem to have more H.'s to their
tongues, than clothes to their backs.

That the fairies have particularly fair complexions, considering they
dance so much in the sunlight.

That the tight and scanty costume of the fairies is most insufficient
protection from the showers that must be required to produce the
gigantic and highly-coloured fairy _flora_.

That the chief fairy (to judge from her allusions to current events)
must take in the daily papers.

That harlequin is always shaking his bat, but nothing seems to come of
it, and that it is hard to say why he comes on or goes off, or, in
short, what he's at altogether.

That if clown and pantaloon want to catch columbine, it is hard to see
why they don't catch her.

That pantaloon must have been greatly neglected by his children to be
exposed without some filial protection to such ill-usage from clown.

That clown leads a reckless and abandoned life, between thefts,
butter-slides, hot pokers, nurse-maids, and murdered babies, and on the
whole is lucky to escape hanging.

That policemen are made to be chaffed, cuffed, chased, and knocked
head-over-heels.

HIS FIRST AND LAST PLAY

     RALPH ESSENDEAN, _aged about fifty, is discovered at a
     writing-desk. He studies a newspaper, from which he reads aloud,
     thoughtfully:--"So that a successful play may bring its author
     anything from five to twenty thousand pounds." He lays down the
     paper, mutters, "H'm!" and taking up a pencil bites it
     meditatively. Enter Mrs. Essendean._

_Mrs. Essendean_ (_crossing to Ralph, and placing her hand on his
shoulder, asks affectionately_). Well, dear, and how is the play getting
on?

_Ralph_ (_irritably_). You talk of the play, Matilda, as though it were
possible to write a four-act drama in ten minutes. The play is not
getting on at all well, for the simple reason that I am only just
thinking out the idea.

_Mrs. Essendean_ (_seating herself by the table_). How nice, dear! And
what _is_ the idea?

_Ralph_ (_grimly_). That is just what I am wondering about. Now if you
will kindly retire to the kitchen and make an omelette, or discharge the
cook, I shall be obliged.

    [_Leans over his desk._

_Mrs. E._ But, dear, I am sure the cook is a most excellent servant,
and----

_Ralph_ (_turning round and speaking with repressed exasperation_). That
was simply my attempt at a humorous explanation of my wish to be alone,
Matilda.

_Mrs. E._ (_smiling indulgently and rising_). Well, dear, of course if
it's going to be a _funny_ play, I know you would like to be alone.
(_Pausing at the open door._) And will you read it to us after dinner?
You know the Willoughby-Smythes will be here, and Mr. and Mrs. Vallance
from the Bank are coming in afterwards. I am sure they would like to
hear it.

_Ralph_ (_irritably_). The play isn't written yet. (_Plaintively._) _Do_
go!

_Mrs. E._ (_sweetly_). I'm sure you'd like to be alone. Don't keep
dinner waiting.

     [_Beams on him affectionately and exits. Ralph gives a sigh of
     relief, rumples his hair, and then writes for a few minutes. Then
     pauses, leans back, biting his pencil, when the door is flung open,
     and a very good imitation of a whirlwind bursts into the room. The
     whirlwind is a robust person of forty, he has a large round red
     face fringed with sandy whiskers, and is one mass of health and
     happiness. He wears Norfolk jacket, knickerbockers, gaiters and
     thick boots, and carries a golfing bag. He slaps Ralph heartily on
     the back, and laughs boisterously. Ralph collapses._

_Tom_ (_heartily_). How are you? Going strong--what? Asked the wife for
you, and she told me you were in here writing a play. Rippin' idea--what?

_Ralph_ (_worried, but striving to be pleasant and polite_). What do you
want, old chap?

_Tom_ (_cheerfully_). Nothin' particular, only just to see how you were
gettin' on--what? Do you good to have half an hour out, just a few
holes--golf--what?

_Ralph_ (_with great self-restraint_). Thanks, old man. Not now. You
don't mind my asking you to leave me to myself a bit?

_Tom_ (_amiably rising and picking up his bag_). All right, old chap,
you know best--what? Thought I'd just look in--hey?--what? Well, I'm
off. (_Goes to door, thinks for a moment, and then turns round._) I say,
I know Thingummy's acting manager. If I can put in a word about your
play--hey?--what?

_Ralph_ (_rises hurriedly. Shakes hands with Tom, and skilfully
manoeuvres him into the passage, then calls after him_). Good-bye, old
man, and many thanks. (_Closes the door and returns to his desk,
grinding his teeth._) Confound him! (_Takes up paper and writes a few
lines, then reads aloud._) "Puffington puts the letter in his pocket and
passes his hand through his hair. He groans 'O, why did I ever write
those letters? I know Flossie, and this means fifty pounds at least, and
if ever my mother-in-law gets to hear of it! O lor, here she is'" (_Puts
down the paper and looks up at the ceiling._) Now, speaking to myself as
one man to another, I can't help thinking that this sort of thing has
been done before. I seem to have heard it somewhere. I'll--I'll--try a
fresh start. (_Writes hurriedly for a few minutes and then reads._)
"Scene.--Fashionable watering place, the beach is crowded; on the pier
the band is playing a dreamy waltz. Edwin and Maud are discovered in an
open boat. _Edwin._ You must be tired of rowing, sweetest; come and
steer. _Maud._ Just as you like, darling. (_As they change seats the
boat capsizes. After clinging for twenty minutes to the upturned keel,
they are rescued by a passing steamer._)" That's all right for a
"situation," but there seems a lack of dialogue. They can't very well
talk while they are clinging to the boat; and what the deuce could they
be talking about before? If I let them drown I shall have to introduce
fresh characters. Bother! (_Meditates with frowning brow._) Playwriting
appears to present more difficulties than I thought. (_Takes up a
newspaper._) "May bring in anything from five to twenty thousand
pounds!" Sounds tempting, but I wonder how it's done?

     [_Takes a cigar from the mantelpiece, lights it, and, seating
     himself near the fire, smokes thoughtfully. Gradually his head
     sinks back on to the top of the chair, the cigar drops from his
     relaxed fingers, and as he sleeps, the shadow of a smile breaks
     across his face. An hour elapses; he is still sleeping. Enter Mrs.
     Essendean, who brushes against the writing-table and sweeps the
     sheets of manuscript to the ground._

_Mrs. Essendean_ (_crossing to Ralph and lightly shaking him_). My dear,
my dear, not dressed yet! Do you know the time--just the half-hour.


(_Ralph starts up._) Eh? (_Looks at the clock._) Nearly half past, by
Jove! I shan't be two seconds.

    [_Rushes hastily from the room._

_Mrs. Essendean (picks up the extinguished cigar, and drops it daintily
into the fire. Looks round the room and sees the littering
manuscript._) What an untidy old thing it is! (_Picks up the sheets,
crumples them into a ball and throws them into the waste-paper basket._)
There, that looks better.

    [_Gazes into the mirror, pats her hair, and exit._

BETWEEN THE ACTS; OR, THE DRAMA IN LIQUOR

     SCENE--_Refreshment Saloon at a London Theatre. A three-play bill
     forms the evening's entertainment. First Act over. Enter Brown,
     Jones, and Robinson._

_Brown._ Well, really a very pleasant little piece. Quite amusing. Yes;
I think I will have a cup of coffee or a glass of lemonade. Too soon
after dinner for anything stronger.

_Jones._ Yes, and really, after laughing so much, one gets a thirst for
what they call light refreshments. I will have some ginger-beer.

_Robinson._ Well, I think I will stick to iced-water. You know the
Americans are very fond of that. They always take it at meal-times, and
really after that capital _équivoque_ one feels quite satisfied. (_They
are served by the bar attendant._) That was really very funny, where he
hides behind the door when she is not looking.

    [_Laughs at the recollection._

_Brown._ And when the uncle sits down upon the band-box and crushes the
canary-cage!

    [_Chuckles._

_Jones._ Most clever. But there goes the bell, and the curtain will be
up directly. Rather clever, I am told. The _Rose of Rouen_--it is
founded on the life of _Joan of Arc_. I am rather fond of these
historical studies.

_Brown._ So am I. They are very interesting.

_Robinson._ Do you think so? Well, so far as I am concerned, I prefer
melodrama. Judging from the title, _The Gory Hand_ should be uncommonly
good.

    [_Exeunt into Theatre. After a pause they return to the Refreshment
    Room._

_Brown._ Well, it is very clever; but I confess it beats me. (_To bar
attendant._) We will all take soda-water. No, thanks, quite neat, and
for these gentlemen too.

_Jones._ Well, I call it a most excellent psychological study. However,
wants a clear head to understand it. (_Sips his soda-water._) I don't
see how she can take the flag from the Bishop, and yet want to marry the
Englishman.

_Robinson._ Ah, but that was before the vision. If you think it over
carefully, you will see it was natural enough. Of course, you must allow
for the spirit of the period, and other surrounding circumstances.

_Brown._ Are you going to stay for _The Gory Hand_?

_Jones._ Not I. I am tired of play-acting, and think we have had enough
of it.

_Robinson._ Well, I think I shall look in. I am rather fond of strong
scenes, and it should be good, to judge from the programme.

_Jones._ Well, we will "sit out." It's rather gruesome. Quite different
from the other plays.

_Robinson._ Well, I don't mind horrors--in fact, like them. There goes
the bell. So I am off. Wait until I come back.

_Brown._ That depends how long you are away. Ta, ta!

    [_Exit Robinson._

_Jones._ Now, how a fellow can enjoy a piece like that, I cannot
understand. It is full of murders, from the rise to the fall of the
curtain.

_Brown._ Yes--but Robinson likes that sort of thing. You will see
by-and-by how the plot will affect him. It is rather jumpy, especially
at the end, when the severed head tells the story of the murder to the
assistant executioner. I would not see it again on any account.

_Jones._ No--it sent my maiden aunt in hysterics. However, it has the
merit of being short. (_Applause._) Ah, there it's over! Let's see how
Robinson likes it. That _tableau_ at the end, of the
starving-coastguardsman expiring under the rack, is perfectly awful!
(_Enter Robinson, staggering in._) Why, my boy, what's the matter?

_Brown._ You do look scared! Have something to drink? That will set it
all to-rights!

_Robinson_ (_with his eyes protruding from his head, from horror_).
Help, help! help! (_After a long shudder._) Brandy! Brandy!! Brandy!!!

    [_At all the places at the bar there is a general demand for alcohol._

_Brown._ Yes. Irving was right; soda-water does very well for
Shakspeare's histories, but when you come to a piece like _The Bells_,
you require supporting.

    [_Curtain and moral._

stage--and his father an alderman and 'im in his father's business, and
all the family thought of so 'ighly in Clapham! It's a _great grief_ to
us, _I assure_ you, Mr. Lamborn! Oh! if you could only dissuade 'im! But
it's too late for that, I'm afraid, so p'raps you wouldn't mind givin'
him a leadin' part in your next piece!"]

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
