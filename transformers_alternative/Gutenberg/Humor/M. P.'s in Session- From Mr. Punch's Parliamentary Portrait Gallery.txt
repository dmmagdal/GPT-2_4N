 [Illustration: CHAPLIN'S OPPORTUNITY.]

 "A ready wit and a fluent tongue are valuable auxiliaries. But force
 of character, consciousness of power, masculine ability in grappling
 with complicated questions, and that species of eloquence, the effect
 of which arises rather from earnestness, straightforwardness, and
 elevation of sentiment, than from sparkling or elaborate rhetoric, give
 a man a position in the House of Commons which leaves him little in
 need of such other gifts as we have mentioned."--_Standard, Dec. 30._

 HARRY FURNISS's ROYAL ACADEMY.

 An Artistic Joke.


The Exhibition consisted of eighty-seven pictures, in black and white
of course, but otherwise similar in size and general appearance to
those annually seen on the walls of Burlington House. Anyone who
visited it must have seen that it was the result of many years of
labour, and not a few of the pictures possessed an artistic value
quite apart from their interest as pictorial travesties. A wish
has been very generally expressed that some permanent record, in a
portable shape, but in character consonant with the artistic purpose
of the Exhibition, should be procurable by the public at large, both
those who saw and those who did not see the originals at the
Gainsborough Gallery and elsewhere.

To meet this wish an #ALBUM#, containing Reproductions of these
#EIGHTY-SEVEN PICTURES#, with which will be included the contents of
#THE ILLUSTRATED CATALOGUE#, has been prepared and largely subscribed
for. The issue of these Albums, however, which will be the only
reproductions of the Exhibition, is strictly limited to #ONE THOUSAND
COPIES#, each of which will be signed by the Artist.

It may be mentioned that the whole of this undertaking, from its
conception to the present time, has been in Mr. Furniss's own hands.
This has enabled Mr. Furniss scrupulously to maintain the artistic
character of the whole enterprise. In the preparation of this Album he
has spared no time or expense in trying reproductions by the different
processes at home and abroad, similar to those used in the Album of
the Royal Academy Pictures of 1886, and the annual reproductions of
the French Salon. Not, however, being satisfied with any of these
cheaper methods, he has, regardless of the great cost, adopted the
finest method of photogravure--viz., the Photo Intaglio process of A.
and C. Dawson, No. 3, Farringdon Street, and Hogarth Works, Chiswick,
the reproductions being made under his own supervision. Each plate is
hand-printed, and will in every way surpass, for artistic quality,
anything of the kind ever published.

As PHOTOGRAVURE is the best and most faithful, as well as the most
expensive method, this Album is certain to be valuable, and a worthy
and complete memorial of the "Artistic Joke"; whilst the price charged
will be only _Â£3 3s._, the same as fixed, originally, when the
adoption of the cheaper process was contemplated.

The size of the Album is Imperial Quarto (11 by 15 inches); the
plates range, on an average, from 4 Ã 6 to 7Â½ Ã 9 inches. The
whole is handsomely and tastefully bound in cloth and gilt edged.

AFTER THE THOUSAND VERITABLE _Ãdition de Luxe_ WERE PRINTED, THE
PLATES WERE DESTROYED.

_#The whole Edition is rapidly being exhausted and the price will be
raised to FIVE Guineas in a few days#_.

_Orders should be forwarded to_ THE TYPOGRAPHIC-ETCHING CO.,
_No. 3, Farringdon Street_.

_#Â£3 3s. 6d.#_ (_including case for packing_).

"The genius of Leech has never been seen to greater advantage than in
this gallery."--_Morning Post._

"We doubt whether in the whole range of the literary or pictorial art
of the period, the earlier portion of the Victorian era has been
elsewhere so vigorously, so truthfully, as well as so humorously
portrayed as in JOHN LEECH'S inimitable pictures. The series has an
importance beyond the amusement of the moment--it serves both to
commemorate the genius of the artist and the character of the
age."--_Country Gentleman._

"There can be no better book for a drawing-room table, to suggest
subjects of talk. The arts of engraving have made rapid progress since
these pictures first appeared, but it would be hard to surpass the
pregnant humour of the more famous of the political cartoons. They put
the points on all the critical periods of our Parliamentary history,
and indicate in effective outline the action of political
celebrities."--_Times._

"It is surprising to find how complete a history of the times they
present in vivid form, at least in its most salient features; and a
history which is not confined to political events, but which catches
and stereotypes many of the evanescent phases of popular fashion and
opinion, which could hardly be preserved in any other
way."--_Guardian._

"This chronicle must have a place amongst standard books of
reference."--_Spectator._

"Mr. Leslie has a keen sense of the picturesque, while a genuine
enthusiasm for the beauties of scenery to be found in the course of a
leisurely boat-trip from Putney to Oxford, gives life and even force
to what he says.... 'Our River' is not an exhaustive work, but it
should be read by all persons who are in any way interested in the
subject."--_Times._

"The diction moves in a sort of endless ripple, now telling of
water-weeds and bank-flowers and birds, now lingering pleasantly
over some of the traditions and old-world lore of which the Thames
furnishes such a goodly quantity."--_Graphic._

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
